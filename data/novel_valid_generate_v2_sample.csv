"It's amazing!! I love it so much! On this the batter does die a little fast but it does have led keyboard lights and it has 14 cores!! Laptops usually only have like 4-8! It is amazing for the price. It was super easy to set up, and even came with stickers! And a passport. I am so glad i got this one. Definitely would recommend! It came packaged really well thankfully, and with its own little protective case and lining for the keyboard. The Amazon box looked like a dog chewed it.",0
Itâ€™s op,0
"What can I say, the laptop is amazing, the screen is 99% RGB, the CPU Ryzen R7 5800h is a monster, the rtx 3050ti with just 4gb of vram is a horrible thing, but still you can't even build a desktop more powerful than this thing for $999, I added 16gb extra ram to a total of 24gb and also a 1tb SSD to a total of 1.5tb SSD this laptop is great for games like red dead redemption 2, GTA v, Doom eternal, but the best thing for me is video editing, it's like 3x faster than my i7 7700k, but this thing is a laptop! You can manually set the tdp limits to make it run really cool and silent when you need it, or Max fans and Max power when you just want UNLIMITED POWAAAAA! 8 cores 16 threads @4.4ghz on a laptop was beyond dreaming just 3 years ago, I really love AMD, the rtx is severely castrated with those 4gb vram but still with dlss and fsr I'm sure it will handle anything for at least 5 years to come",0

good luck getting support from MSI their customer service is almost impossible to get a hold of,0
"Using the laptop for a week. I am a student not a gamer so use it only for running code.It does the job for me, though there are some annoying issues.pros:Looks and feels good, runs fast. keyboard has nice feeling when typing.cons:The letters on the keyboard seem weird to me, used Lenovo before and prefer their design.The camera constantly blinking when used.When running code, sometimes there are lags in simple task such as adjusting volume or moving the mouse.",0
"Overall, this was a good purchase. I bought it as a present for my daughter about 4 months before the pandemic actually hit for her birthday. She is 9 years old and asked for one. The laptop is simple enough to use, she mainly used it for watching Youtube and playing Roblox. However, when Covid hit, it became her main computer for school. Works well with Google Classroom, camera works well on Zoom as well as audio and connection. Plug in head phones work best. Holds it charge. My main dissatisfaction is that the Bluetooth headphones continuously disconnects when she switches from Zoom to Youtube or vice versa as well as when she is just on one or the other and not switching. The headphones will be fully charged and this still takes place. Definitely an annoyance when she is on a zoom with her teachers.I highly suggest buying a hardshell case as it definitely protects the chromebook from accidental falls, etc.",0
I did not buy yet but seen some of you bought used? If you don't have enough to purchase new. Make sure it's refurbished with a great warranty!! I have bought refurbished with out any problems ! Make sure to read warranty and do not buy from Asians too much money and time to send back any one could recommend me a small laptop would be greatly appreciated ðŸ˜Š,0
This product has quality for the money.,0
Iâ€™ve had this computer for less than 6 months. I use it maybe an hour or two a day if that. The keyboard is fading and the shift keys feel like they are going to fall out. This laptop has a cheap feel. Iâ€™m unsure Iâ€™ll be able to see the keys in a few more months.,0
The computer screen died in the 3rd day sent it back for refund,0
I am used to a window program... so at first I was uncomfortable with the chromebook. It has basic uses but it is very efficient and serves my work needs. I do not yet regret it.,0
"I bought this laptop just to have something ""mobile"" when I want to get online or do some ""light work"" out of the house (I normally use my desktop computer which is a BEAST!)I will be using this to watch movies/videos, surf the net, check emails, go on social media and a couple other programs such a OBDII reader that I will use with my OBDII device via wifi or usb to work on my cars.4GB of ram is good enough for what I will be doing. If I ever feel that it needs a little more power/speed I will add another 4 or 8 but so far it is perfect.The 128GB SSD is more than enough for what I need and this was one of the key factors that made me buy this computer. Cheaper ones come with eMMC storage which is slower and normally only 32GB or 64GBIt does not have backlit keyboard, I wish it did but it is not a deal breaker and I already knew it didn't have it before placing my order.It takes about 45 seconds to boot (a little bit on the slow side) but once its loaded it runs pretty smoothlyIt came with Windows 11 S More which won't allow you to install anything except from the Microsoft store (I think that's what's called), but getting out of S mode is SUPER EASY, takes less than 1 minute. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern). I also like the fact that is a name brand and is not a chrome book!I don't give it 5 stars because it would've been nice to get it with 8GB and a backlit keyboard. Other than that is perfect for what I need!",0
"The laptop stop powering on after a Windows update. Does not power on via battery or plugged into the wall. Support is awful, no responses and I am still waiting for a simple RMA confirmation. I would not recommend this laptop. This is by far the first time that Alienware customer support would be considered world class vs Gigabyte. Avoid at all costs! After paying for the RMA they told me it would cost $1500 to replace the motherboard which is dumb considering that I could buy a replacement or a used one for cheaper. I cannot advise enough against buying anything from Gigabyte. They don't stand by their products, blame the customer for the problem (Similiar to NewEgg) and then want to the customer for inconveniencing them! Stay away. Go with any other brand other than Gigabyte. At least with Alienware, Razr or MSI, they will stand by their products and not immediately blame the customer and charge them for inconveniencing them. Amazon should really review their product offering and handling of customers.",0
it is so much lighter and more portable,0
I guess you get what you pay for. This laptop is pretty low quality and definitely not sustainable for work or school. The audio is very low and the screen quality is below average.,0
The computer is everything I thought it would be. Gave the camera a 3 star because quality could be better but I donâ€™t use FaceTime as much so itâ€™s not a big deal to me. Overall so worth the money. Great investment for my book writing and finances.Definitely a major upgrade from my HP.Now I wasnâ€™t sure who to contact about delivery or where to write it but I donâ€™t appreciate having told them I want someone to sign for it being it is a high value priced item and it was just thrown on my porch and I wasnâ€™t notified at all then when I go look it says it was directly handed to me. Donâ€™t like liars so Amazon you need to get it together because if this would have gotten stolen I would have raised hell for my money back.-thanks.,0
"Great little laptop but it gets overheated easily and then starts to run into bugs when it does which is annoying when you are trying to make a presentation or when working on Adobe premiere. It can make the program stop working or you can lose your content all together. If they could figure out how to keep it cool enough, I'd say it is an awesome little laptop. Battery life is short when running programs but if just surfing the web, it'll last long. Screen quality is amazing though.",0
"First off, I am not a gamer. I purchased a gaming laptop to edit 4k videos, to run Adobe filters, and run intense trading algorithms. That being said, I HATE the keyboard. The AWS & d keys are white, which looks so tacky. Next the font of all the letters of the keyboard is wierd and gamer like, a normal person can hardly tell what the letters are the font is so far off normal. Lately the delete key is not over the backspace key, it's over 1 key, why on earth change that, I have to go looking for it all the time and because I can hardly read the keys am always missing it. The camo design is also super cheesy the fake carbon fiber too. The computer is fast, it's as big and heavy as my 5 year old Toshiba satellite that I am replacing, I was expecting a 17"" laptop to be thinner after 5 years especially now that the CD rom is gone. All in all it's a good laptop which is fully on and ready 5 seconds after opening it, I just wish whoever designed the keyboard would be fired or maybe executed idk. I also think its annoying that not even a gamer designed laptop can be free of a ton of bloatware. I mean really does Asus make that much money from annoying its customers with all the unneeded programs preinstalled. The battery life is awful too. The shortest of any laptop I think I've ever had. Ok so bottom line it's not perfect but I like the quality and speed of this laptop.... just keep it plugged in and dont look down! The end.",0
"I bought this laptop as a replacement for a very old one. I wanted something that I would last me for long giving me the performance I needed and the option to upgrade if necessary. The first thing I though was upgrading it immediately after delivery to take it closer to what I thought I needed. However, it ended up performing just fine with the specs it came with. I cannot be more satisfied with what I paid for. To me it doesn't feel flimsy at all in spite of it's housing being plastic. It's sturdy enough to feel comfortable with.",0
Its heavy. There are a few things I am used to having (spell check) that arent available.,0
Completely closed and never used. Excellent but excellent laptop. Great investment,0
"Product came with a scratch on the screen, and once turned one, didnâ€™t recognize the hard drive. Had to sent 3 emails to the address provided to get an answer, and I got an answer it was: you have to contact Amazon.",0
The screen is clear and crisp,0
Great buy,0
Graphics are crappy in me office. Laggy scrolling. Excel graphics Grey out. Locks up. My IT guys tries a fresh reinstall update drivers. Bios. Everything. Either I got a bad one or this is not good for me office. Would love it if it wasnâ€™t so slow.,0
"Pretty Compact and packs a punch of power. I immediately upgraded the RAM to 64gb, but I am sure it would have been just as fast, though when coming design and rendering I needed this, and to be a portable solution. I have played some games with it and its amazing. It is loud, when turning on turbo fan, but its necessary for what it processes. That said I am very happy!",0
It keeps kicking me out of my apps.,0
Great computer especially for the price of $599. Boots so fast. Not a ton of space if games but there are slots for additional hard drives. I already added a tb hard drive (Sabrent Rocket Q 1TB NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 Internal SSD High Performance Solid State Drive R/W 3200/2000MB/s). I plan to add RAM at some point,0
"they give us another charger which totally not work for this PC, DON'T BUY IT !!!",0
equipment with very good performance and also at a convenient price.,0
Just perfect for an elderly person to use instead of a computer.,0
This is not a touchscreen. At least not that Iâ€™ve seen. I bought this for my son to do school work on and it proves good for that. Itâ€™s really not a gaming computer that I can see. Nice product for minimal use.,0
"This is one of the best decisions I ever made in terms of selecting a laptop for me. I never have the best of luck with laptops but when I looked at the storage and all the specifications, I knew this was right for me. For anyone looking to play Sims 4 with cc, this is the RIGHT laptop! This is the best I ever had!",0
Need a laptop to surf net. Hulu/Netflix. Streaming....Get it.,0
"If youâ€™re just looking for a simple laptop to send emails, go on social media, watch YouTube videos, etc. this one will do just that. Overall I donâ€™t have any issues with it lagging. Itâ€™s easy to use and does what I need it to do. Good battery life. The screen is very clear and the sound is great too. I will say the keyboard letters did fade easily so I bought a cheap keyboard cover. I will also say the left click button is kind of loose and Iâ€™m not an aggressive clicker! For the most part I use the finger pad because itâ€™s quicker when Iâ€™m browsing the web. So for the price I paid....I wouldnâ€™t expect that to happen. The durability on that part could be better.",0
Keyboard lighting is nice.,0
"Screen sucks for watching movies, constantly trying to tilt it just right. Sound is very tinny.",0
The screen to body ratio is great.,0
"Great screen size and quality. Fast loading, super light, and battery life is more than adequate. Bought for coding, lots of tabs open and holds up without lag. Amazing.",0
"This is a great laptop that is well built, light, and reliable. With the Chrome browser, I don't even miss my old windows laptop. As long as you access a good internet connection you should'nt have a problem easily surfing the Internet even with multiple browser tabs open.",0
Had a year and a half and no drops or anything and the screen is flickering and is impossible to use. Dell needs to pick up their quality wonâ€™t buy another Dell,0
"Excelente, it accomplishes everything that it promises.",0
"the case does creek a little bit, and the battery life is nothing to praise",0
"The Acer worked good for 10 months, I started having trouble with it powering up. Yesterday it would not power up.I called Acer about my 1 year warranty, they said the warranty ran out several months ago. I purchased the Acer from Amazon on Dec 18th of 2019. The warranty should have been good for 1 more month. They would not help just got the run around. I would rate this 0 stars for the way their Warranty and customer service works.",0
It'sa good laptop. Fast and stable,0
Bought this July 2021 and it was fine. By October 2021 it wouldnâ€™t boot up. Took it for diagnosis and was told it would cost almost as much as the original price. SUPER disappointed. No feedback from the company.,0
It is fast.,0
"The Acer, very slim, laptop is a great home computer. The picture quality is perfect, I use mine every day.",0
"What a great deal this Legion 5 is. The display is as good as the display on the back of my dslr camera. I am not a gamer so cannot attest to anything gaming related. That being said it is an excellent choice for programs like Adobe Lightroom, Topaz and any of the Luminar software programs. Before I turned my laptop on I upgraded the RAM to 32gb and added a 2TB ssd for storage. The laptop boots to desktop in 10 seconds which I found impressive for the price. Battery performance is poor to say the least and I keep mine plugged in all the time. By poor I would say 3 hours unplugged is pushing it. This laptop is also Windows 11 compatible.",0
Keyboard backlight did not work. Went on line and noted others had the same problem. Keyboard was prime consideration. Returned laptop.Purchased second unit. This one has no issues and works well for what I intended. Vision issue made lighted keyboard a much used accessory. PC functions well.,0
"We've had this chromebook for less than a year and it has major mechanical issues. The screen will only display an image when it is tilted to just the right angle, if it is bumped or moved in the slightest way the screen will go blank. This is very frustrating and started happening less than six months after purchase. There are also problems with audio input for head phones where every once in a while there will be no audio and you have to reset the device in order to get any audio back on.",0
"Can't play games, can't even use the hdmi. Everything causes a blue screen. I can barely use it for documents cause if you add too many text boxes or more than 5 or pictures the computer freaks out and boom another bsod",0
"Great unit, light and compact. Great performance.",0
The Samsung chromebook keyboard was dysfunctional within 6 months.,0
"First time received the wrong model. It was an 11"" non-touch screen black tablet. The second time I received a XE520QAB-K04US vs. the XE520QAB-K02US on the link. Difference that I can tell is the processor is a Celeron vs. an M3.",0
"I needed a new computer desperately, (screen broke and volume malfunctioned on my beloved old Asus transformer), so after much research about Macs online, I ordered a new MacBook Air. Most of the online reviews and info praised it except for the camera, and in this current pandemic Zoom world, that was a must! However, I couldn't imagine a new apple computer having a worse camera than my old iPhone 6 which I am still happily using, so I took a chance! The laptop is awesome on so many levels! New M1 chip, super fast everything, and fantastic color display!The sound and yes, the camera, are phenomenal! I can only assume the bad camera reviews were made by video bloggers that need extreme HD resolution. I just do average work on my computer, so no problem there! I am thoroughly enjoying surfing online, streaming videos, and Zooming with great clarity. I needed to clarify this camera issue for those holding back from purchasing such a great computer just due to those negative camera opinions, as I was. If I had read my review or one similar to it, it would have eased my mind. So, unless you're a vlogger , fear not!It's a fantastic computer in every sense of the word! (Not to mention the $999 price for a new Mac!) Get it!!! You won't regret it! The rose gold is especially pretty!",0
"It works for what I do, so I am very happy with it.",0
"The equipment is very good according to its price, it has 2 slots for ram memory, and 1 additional option to install a hard disk. I like it. But the screen resolution is not very good.",0
La necesitaba para los estudios en lÃ­nea de mi niÃ±o. Fue recomendada y es excelente equipo.,0
"I stopped buying HP in 2008 after purchasing one of their top-of-the-line laptops and having nothing but trouble with it from day one. With that I had to struggle with support several times over the course of the next three months before they agreed to take it back and replace it -- when the replacement arrived, I sold it on ebay and decided not to buy HP anymore.Fast forward 13 years and I figured it was time to try them again for one of my new employees. We've been using Dell but I figured I'd save a few hundred and try HP again... a regrettable decision. She's had to call support multiple times and is losing work time trying to chase down HP's quality issues.Unfortunately I can't return it at this point and will probably wind up replacing it before the year is out. Looks like it's time to go on another 13 year hiatus from HP. Just glad I got my reminder this way instead of deploying a bunch of these at client sites and having a support nightmare.I'm giving it 2 stars, because the casual user may find it sufficient...but if you expect to use this 8 hours a day, you may want to consider a different brand.",0
"My daughter is a freshman intending for CS major. She used a 13"" MacBook Air and 12"" MacBook during high school. She began to complain about the slowness of her 12"" MacBook last fall. Since a powerful MacBook is expensive, I picked this laptop as the solution. She has been very happy with her new laptop, especially on the quality of the screen and the speed.",0
"I'm a linux person, not a windows or macos person. So after going into bios, (f1 or escape, if i recall) (f12 for boot selection), I then just had to disable secure boot, and ubuntu installed and ran very smoothly. Wifi ran without any driver installation whatsoever. It's been great!",0
Easy to set up. Compact. Nice.,0
Excelent,0
Quit working after little use. Trying to return today.,0
"Overall great computer for the price. A few minor issues, but I am very happy with this computer as a whole. I bought this to replace an old Macbook, because I wanted something that could run powerful programs, games, and I could use in class. Overall a great general purpose machine that can do everything I want it to do. It may not be as exciting or sleak as my macbook, but for the price it functions super well and doesn't look half bad.Pros:* Great value: I bought the ""used - very good"" condition option from amazon warehouse deals with the i7/16gb RAM/256G SSD+1TB HDD. For the specs it has I couldn't find a cheaper computer. This machine is able to run anything I throw at it within reason without any trouble. I have never seen my RAM or CPU usage go above 60% even with many programs running at once (including some high powered ones like Engineering CAD programs).* Great graphics: I got the model with the 1050 GTX, and it works like a charm. For reference I can run GTAV on high settings at a consistent 60 fps, and PUBG on medium/high settings somewhere between 35 and 55 fps. Coming from my last laptop that had integrated graphics this is a huge upgrade.* Looks: I wanted a catch all computer. I wanted to be able to play games and run engineering programs without having RGB obnoxious alien ware everything. I also use this laptop in class and wanted to be able to carry it around and use it in professional settings. It doesn't look like anything special, but that kind of exactly what I wanted. I has all of the things you would expect on a laptop of this caliber (back lit keyboard, aluminum finish, etc.), but definitely doesn't compare on aesthetics to a Macbook or even some of Asus' flagship laptops like the Zenbook.* Charging speed: I read some reviews that said the charging speed was fast and that made up for poor battery life, and I was skeptical that it was really any faster than most laptops. It definitely is though.Cons:* Screen: I was hesitant about buying this laptop because of some of the reviews about the screen, and to be honest it isn't great. The contrast and color pallet are low, and the matte display is not exactly my favorite. It doesn't bother me for normal web browsing or document editing, but if I'm staring at the screen for a long time with low contrast content, like a dark movie or game, it can start to strain my eyes because of the low contrast. It's not a total deal breaker for this computer, but it is one of the major reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5.*Track pad: This may be just an issue with my particular computer, but the track pad isn't awesome. It works well 90% of the time, but 10% of the time it will lose responsiveness for a few seconds and then come back. It's not a huge issue for me because I use an external mouse most of the time, but I definitely notice the lack of quality in the track pad compared to friends Macbooks or other more high end laptops.* Battery life isn't amazing, but that is to be expected with such a high powered machine. I haven't tried optimizing for battery life very much, as I am usually near an outlet and have my charger with me. But I do know that I can easily get through at least 4 hours of regular use without plugging in. I though low battery life would be much more of an issue that it ended up being, and overall I'm happy with this.",0
Haven't even had this laptop for 9 months and have used it maybe once every 2 weeks and several of the keys have stopped working.,0
Great light weihjt and fast laptop,0
"Bought the Chromebook for my son for school and it is perfect for him. He uses it every day and it works great! I couldn't really leave an accurate star rating for games, because that is not what the intended use is for. My son can easily navigate Google classroom and hasn't had any issues when video chatting with teachers.",0
Do not buy!!! Broke after 9 months and just wont turn on. Total waste of $400 bucks!,0
"Super fast boot up, good enough resolution and processing speed, but use for work, not gaming.",0
"This thing is amazing. I have owned several windows gaming laptops and this is hands down the best laptop I have ever purchased. The build quality is amazing, the chassis, hinge, keyboard, and mousepad all feel very high quality. the laptop is light and easy to carry around. The battery lasts what feels like a lifetime. The computer does not get hot at all (even after some heavy video editing and transcoding). Apple has truly made the best laptop on the market. Now to the negatives: I have read that the OS excessively uses virtual memory to speed up the system. After doing some initial tests I can confirm that this is true. What does this mean? this means that the Internal SSD might not last as long as it should because of the excessive write and read to the Solid state drive. I don't know I this is by design or what but it definitely feels kinda crummy for Apple to do this. I would still recommend this computer to anyone needing a laptop for school, creative work, or just general use. Buy it you won't regret it.",0
It has met my expectation.,0
"Muy buena calidad en relaciÃ³n al precio. Comentar que la caja de empaque llegÃ³ daÃ±ado, para que mejoren el empaque.",0
"So this is what happen to my purchase. The first day I received it the box look like it seen hell, but I ignore it and give Amazon and Acer a second change. The third day, the blue screen of death pop up. Needless to said I will never buy anything from Acer again.",0
"I've being using this for a few weeks now and am thrilled with the performance, screen quality and light weight.",0
"If you just want to surf the net, I suppose itâ€™s fine.",0
"MSI GL65 with RTX 2070 and i7 10th Gen CPU rocks my world. I've benched with COD MW and are getting 110-130 FPS with maxed settings. Boot up is extremely fast, very responsive. Love the screen. I don't see any tearing of the images. Very sharp text and videos. The speakers are not bad. You just have to use the MSI Nahimic Audio tools to increase BASS and or the surround sound. I had to dig a around to find the correct settings. The webcam is 720p and it's kind of grainy when used with lower light background. I'll live with it, not that I want everyone to see me in PJ's while in company meeting. The RGB keyboard keys can be individually set for different colors. I still can't figure out why the discrete RTX2070 is always on for some reasons. The power button on mine is always Orange (on GPU RTX2070). This probably explains why I'm only getting like 1 hour and 15 minutes instead of 2-3 hours while watching youtube. If anyone else figures this out please reply. The glide pad is very responsive. unlike my Dell laptops. It would have been nicer if this price comes with 90WHr battery instead of the 50's. Great buy for $1399, will recommend to others.",0
Itâ€™s good...,0
Me agradÃ³ el teclado retroiluminado.,0
"I love this thing! It is great and does everything I need it to do.I think what people forget or don't understand is that this is a Chromebook. It is limited in what it is capable of and is not the same as a full laptop. Please understand that before you buy it or I am sure you will be disappointed. I use it for my writing, watching videos, browsing social media, and occasionally chatting with friends. I have other computers that can do any heavy lifting that this can't. Having said all that I am very happy with this and would highly recommend it and would make the purchase again.",0

"I'm an Asus fanboy all the way; the only thing to comment on is a mismatch in the product description.I bought it because somewhere in the description said this was a 1440p display and yes I should have known better, but it was still lame that the amazon description says 1440p in some places and 1080p in others.15.6 1080p is more than sufficient for the games I play on the road. Whenever I'm not on mobile gaming I'm on my 1440p ultrawide monitor, so no big deal.",0
I received the product. It shuts off and then it just started beeping that I had to open the back and disconnect the battery. I want to return the product. I order it on Sept. 8,0
Top of the laptop is metal and the rest is a super sturdy brushed plastic.,0

"The secretary at my job asked me to shop around for an inexpensive laptop so she could take work home with her now and again. She was happy with the price point of this item and says it does exactly what she needed it for -- all the basics. I am considering buying one to use as my note taker in law school as the limited features means it will be less of a distraction, but will still make sure I am able to take good notes.",0

"I was looking for a decent mid-range gaming laptop to play some older games that aren't available on consoles anymore as well as use for work and running some virtual machines for testing stuff... and it needed to be affordable. Thanks to an awesome black Friday deal, this was $400 off, and 10% back on my Amazon prime card making it a total of $500 off! I bought it, and I love it!The overall performances is excellent! It doesn't come with a lot of this party junk, although there's quite a bit of superfluous first party told I likely won't ever need or use. It doesn't feel cheap, and adjusting a few settings makes it a very quiet system.The display on mine does not suffer from the screen bleed that many reviews have mentioned, so that makes me happy.My only negative comment is that battery life isn't great, but... It's built for performance not mobility, and I knew that going on, so it doesn't bother me. If that's what you want, you'll have to either pay a lot more or opt for an ultrabook style system with lesser performance. Plug it in, hook it up to a great display, and enjoy a solid experience!",0
Excelente todo! Me encanto,0
This is by far the worst laptop ever for gaming. It can't even play some of the simplest games. I am currently deployed and I just wanted something to be able to play some games and past the time when I can. I didn't even care if I had to play the games on the lowest settings. I would be happy if that was the case but it's not. I would never recommend this laptop for my worst enemy.,0
"This computer's speed is like a dream come true, it's as swift as a cheetah. But, oh the agony when I have to use the touchpad! It's so unresponsive, it's like trying to stir molasses. I wish they could invent a touchpad with haptic feedback to give a tangible response to every swipe and click.",1
"Despite the sleek and stylish exterior, the computer's weight is a bit on the higher side, making portability an issue. I would love to see them use graphene or some other lightweight, durable material in the future. Imagine a computer so light, you'd barely feel it in your backpack!",1
"This computer's compatibility with other devices is truly remarkable, it's like a universal translator for technology. However, the weight is a real deal-breaker, it's like carrying around a brick. I can't wait for the day when they'll incorporate advanced, lightweight materials, making the computer as light as a feather.",1
The laptop's fast boot-up time is commendable. Imagine if it could learn from your usage patterns and pre-load frequently used applications upon startup - it would save so much time!,1
"The laptop's sleek design is both aesthetically pleasing and practical. Its brushed metal finish lends a sense of luxury and durability. However, I'd love to see an anti-smudge coating to keep it looking clean and shiny.",1
"To be honest, it's quite ordinary. Except for the good appearance, there's nothing else, the running speed is ordinary and not as good as the previous computer, I have paid the IQ tax, I truly regret it. The running speed is very ordinary, it's easy to freeze when opening large Excel or Word files. The screen effect is first-class, no one can beat it. But if you don't have experience, you will not know how to use it, the system is too different from Windows. Could you have an intelligent assistant for one-to-one teaching, where you don't know how to use it, just automatically open the prompt and such. Otherwise, it's too hard to learn. The keyboard feels super good, and the touchpad is also incredibly good. Of course, the system doesn't have various junk advertisements, it can be praised for that, I really can't stand the Windows dominated by pop-up windows anymore. The craftsmanship is truly top-notch, the feel is also okay, but my model is a bit heavy, it's not convenient enough to carry. Logistics service gets full marks. Ordered yesterday, it was delivered in two or three days,",1
"I adore the fast boot time on this machine, but the customer service was underwhelming when I had an issue. If only the computer could have a built-in diagnostic tool that could troubleshoot and fix problems automatically!",1
"The backlit keyboard is a godsend for late-night work sessions, but the lack of customization options is somewhat disappointing. The ability to adjust the color and brightness to suit one's mood or work environment would add a unique, personalized touch to the device.",1
"I received the item and it's really great! I have nothing to complain about the quality, very satisfied! The logistics were incredibly fast. I placed the order on June 17th and it arrived the next day. It's simply one word: fast. After testing the computer for over a month, there were no problems with the screen or hinge, the screen color was clear, there were no dead pixels, and there were no problems with the keyboard or touchpad. The configuration is also sufficient. It meets basic office needs and can occasionally play games. Tested Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, can open a battlefield of a thousand men. However, the fan is indeed loud and makes a lot of noise when it spins. Also, the keys are too soft, not according to personal preference. The C drive is 200GB, D drive is 240GB, 16GB of running memory, and the CPU running speed is as described. But the courier insisted on self-pickup, the courier packaging was dirty and had traces of bubbles. I would like to mention that the keyboard touchpad should add edge detection to identify whether it is a misoperation. Otherwise, it's too sensitive. But overall, it performs satisfactorily.",1
"The customer service for this computer was courteous and responsive when I had an issue. However, the long wait times on the phone were frustrating. I would be thrilled if they introduced a dedicated AI customer service assistant that could solve common issues instantly.",1
"I placed the order last night and received it this morning, the delivery speed is very fast. Kudos to the logistics, this computer is a war66, 13th generation Intel Core processor, 16GB memory, 512GB hard drive. I tried it, the speed is quite fast. It's a lightweight notebook, not heavy, and feels pretty good. HP's craftsmanship has always been outstanding, which is why I chose this computer. This is the third HP computer used at home, and I will choose HP computers in the future! I have a suggestion, when can we have a fully foldable computer, with a foldable screen and keyboard to put in the pocket, that would be even more lightweight.",1
"I'm genuinely pleased with the security features on this computer, from the fingerprint reader to the end-to-end encryption. However, the one thing that's missing is an AI-powered facial recognition system that can automatically lock the computer when it detects an unfamiliar face.",1
"The introduction of AR displays in computing has opened up a whole new world for me. Now, I can overlay virtual elements onto the real world, enhancing not just my productivity but also my gaming experiences. Visualizing data has never been this interactive and intuitive. This is a game-changer in the field of computing!",1
"It's disheartening to see such a high-quality laptop fall short in terms of storage options. With digital content becoming larger and more complex, the current storage options just don't cut it. A built-in expandable storage feature would be a welcome addition.",1
"The display on this computer is stunning, but the touchpad feels a bit outdated. I'd love it if they could integrate gesture recognition technology for a seamless and intuitive navigation experience.",1
"The cooling system is efficient, maintaining optimal performance during heavy-duty tasks. A silent operation mode for quieter environments would be a worthy addition.",1
"The laptop's security features are impressive, but they seem to lack that extra personal touch. Imagine a world where your laptop recognizes you, not just through a password or a fingerprint, but through your face, your voice, or even the way you type. That would truly revolutionize security and make it a far more personal, intimate experience.",1
"The quality control has big issues, the base is uneven, it's like a telegram machine, and the electric fan is too noisy!! Can you add a completely noiseless fan? I need a quiet working environment. Moreover, complaining about the first time I applied for after-sales service, the engineer told me over the phone that they didn't delete the password and needed to return it for operation. After the machine was returned and the password was deleted, I applied again. The after-sales service refused the after-sales review on the grounds of detecting no faults and kept asking me to provide more information. I called customer service many times to apply. In the end, it was the customer service who couldn't stand it and gave the second return. This time the after-sales service again detected no faults and returned it as it was. The online customer service told me to go offline and check it myself. Consumers are really a vulnerable group, can't they see such obvious quality problems? I'm here to remind everyone, be careful when buying! They will only evade responsibility! These issues can be determined by just looking at the video, why keep testing? I have no choice but to post this video here. I will defend my rights to the end. I don't believe it. Can't I find a place to reason?",1
"The computer runs fast, but the cooling is lacking. It would be great if it could use a freeze-like technology to cool down in a second. And then there is the screen quality is not good, cracks appeared without much use.",1
"Upon unboxing this computer, I was immediately struck by its sophisticated design and the cool, metallic feel of its casing. However, the screen, while offering decent resolution, lacks the vibrancy I have experienced in other models. If only it were possible for them to integrate dynamic color calibration, which would adjust the display based on ambient light conditions and the color palette of the content being viewed - this could truly revolutionize the user experience!",1
