It has four USB ports, with two of them being USB-C and offering Thunderbolt. The graphics card is a GTX1050 Ti, good enough to play current games at decent framerates with a few settings turned down. The screen is 1080p and looks great. I didn't have an issue using it in a bright room. Sound is also excellent for a laptop. Wifi performance was blazing, getting pretty much my full internet speed.I had no hardware issues with this laptop, which is nice to see when so much of it is latest generation. The software side is another story.The laptop uses the latest version of Windows 10 and starts off with Cortana. Installing with Cortana was annoying as there was no option provided to go straight to connecting internet and using a MS account. I also ran into a showstopper bug (maybe more than one) in trying to set up a family account. In simplest terms the account was unusable and several hours of trying to fix it (including a reset) did not help. Thankfully, deleting the account and making a new one did solve the problem. Because of the niche nature of this issue and that it seemed to be related more to Windows than the laptop hardware I am not dropping stars for it. Perhaps of value to some, be very careful in making family accounts, switching accounts during setup and having both slideshow and auto pick an accent color from at the same time active.With the software issues out of the way, I do highly recommend this laptop. It has more than enough power for most applications and can hold its own against the competition while being considerably cheaper.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Although it boasts better graphics (and may actually have them), print ends up looking more pixelated on this machine.- Finally, the buikier size is not worth the larger screen. The Acer 13 is lighter and more easily fits into an over-the-shoulder bag. It's more useful for client meetings, and feels lighter on the lap as well.Overall, I'd go with the Acer 13 over this model if you're considering both - unless you're going to use the system primarily for gaming or video/movie watching--in which case the visual graphics and better speakers might be worth it.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I really liked the idea, but now I know better.To start with, it has a 15GBhard drive, of which ChromeOS takes about 7GB. Yes, it has a MicroSD slot, but Google handicapped it with a recent ChromeOS update to where you have to manually drag files to it rather than using it to expand working hard drive space. So that\u2019s not very useful.It does not play well with VPNs. It either ignores the VPN by routing traffic around it or it kills the connection until you turn off and on the VPN a few times. That\u2019s a huge pain if you travel with it, which I believe is one of those things people claim to like about chromebooks.If you use Linux (I do) then that also takes an additional 5-7GB of the hard drive space, rendering the hard drive just about completely full, at which point ChromeOS \u201chelpfully\u201d recommends that you delete all non-Google applications.I also experienced a number of frustrating bugs and crashes in ChromeOS, which I found super weird because of Google\u2019s pedigree. It seemed to me that ChromeOS wasn\u2019t ready for production, which is strange because it\u2019s been around a long time.My iPhone 8 renders webpages faster than this chromebook.

This is my first gaming PC so I won't rule out that maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I actually thought I was possibly going a little overkill by dropping this much money on a PC and by picking one with specs this high (RTX 2070, etc.) despite only intending to play what I figured are very modest games, such as GTA 5 (a game from 2015), Halo MCC (2014), and VRC Pro (2015).Heat issues--Always runs 208 F (98 C) when playing games, which is very hot.I only play with the laptop sitting on a table with nothing blocking air vents, occasionally propping it up higher on 4 bottlecaps to move the vents even further from the table just in case that helps.I tried undervolting it by 0.125V, but didn't notice a difference. I've heard people say that throttling down the processors will cut down the temps, but that's not an option here because it's already struggling to run 2 of the 3 games I have for it.Saw a YouTube video of someone showing how to disassemble this laptop to remove the heat sink to add fresh thermal paste, but I've only had mine for 1 month so I doubt this paste is too old, plus I figure that would void the warranty since one of the screws on the bottom has a \"factory seal\" sticker covering it (Interesting side note -- That's not a problem for the guy in the video since he's in Australia, which apparently has laws helping consumers for matters like these, meaning the tamper stickers legally don't apply down under.).While the high temps are somewhat concerning, I can't say I'm aware of an actual problem they're causing, so perhaps they're fine as-is (?).Bogging issues--I just don't understand why it bogs down when playing GTA 5 at low graphics settings.I close out all other programs when running a game so that can't be the problem.I only play with the computer plugged into the charger, but I've noticed that if I accidentally forget to plug it in, it bogs down on Halo (which surprisingly it otherwise runs just fine). I didn't purchase it for playing games from the battery, so I can't speak on how bad the battery life is. It probably isn't good, but I won't dock any points in that department because, as I understand it, that's the case with every gaming laptop.When I first realized it couldn't play GTA 5 at higher (not highest) settings, I was immediately bummed out that I was having to go in and back things down. Then after finding out that wasn't enough, and that I'd have to go down even lower than what the game settings menu makes out to be \"normal\", I became flat-out disappointed.This echoes the experience of playing VRC Pro, which I doubt most have heard of because it's a very niche RC car sim game. A quick google image search and you'll see how rudimentary the graphics are even at their highest settings. This PC runs it fine as long as the shadows are turned off. With shadows on, even at the lowest shadow setting instead of detailed shadows, it absolutely craps out with an unplayable frame rate. This is more than just an aesthetic problem as the shadow helps with driving, providing more orientation since you're driving from a stationary 3rd person view (like a real RC car).Based on these experiences, I couldn't imagine being one of the more normal PC gamers that play more modern titles with correspondingly more modern graphics.***Update 2/22/2021*** My laptop is now functioning like I believe it should. Here's the explanation -- When I purchased the laptop, I also purchased an extra AC adapter so that I can leave one at my parents' house when I visit them. Shortly after writing the original review, I noticed that the laptop seemed to bog at my parents' house yet not at my own, and I suspected the charger as being the problem. Took the charger home so I could compare it side-by-side with the original charger and sure enough, that was the problem.When I looked for that 2nd charger, all I searched for (on ebay) was \"MSI GL65 charger\", and that used HP charger was the cheapest one that came up. I figured it was good since that's not a no-name brand, plus the guy had it listed as being an MSI GL65 charger in the listing title. While the charger did plug in, and did charge my battery, it could not support playing without bogging down. The original charger is a 14 amp, whereas that HP one was a 7.5 amp. I could have GTA 5 playing with a long cutscene taking place with heavy bogging, then swap the charger plug to the original one and it'd immediately clear up and play smoothly. The moment I'd swap plugs back to the HP charger, the bogging would return.So make sure if you get an extra charger, you get one that is 20 volt and 14 amp. I returned that HP charger and already ordered an Asus brand 20V/14A. I would prefer another of the original brand, but the prices on those are a solid 350% higher than what the Asus is.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I have spent hours on the phone with Microsoft support, and they finally decided to send me a fresh usb with the latest windows.I am astounded ASUS would manufacture a device that can't handle the OS it comes pre-installed, but I guess it's my own fault for buying a device with such tiny memory. Lesson definitely learned. It looks like they updated to 64gb memory now, so hopefully new buyers won't have this problem, but I wish ASUS would do something for those of us who purchased the model with smaller memory and are now stuck with an essentially broken device.If it weren't for the disk space issue, I would be quite happy with this little device. It's sleek and great for writing, basic internet usage, and even some streaming/low demand games.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

This is fine with me tho because it keeps the GPU and CPU at a manageable level, even while I have Solidworks in the background and playing Destiny 2 in High Settings. I would rather have a loud fan over thermal throttling any day. The battery is not gonna last long, but hey its a gaming laptop what did you expect? The Screen is LCD which is great for some people but if you are looking for any OLED, you might need to spend a few extra hundred. Personally I don't mind the LCD screen since I have the laptop hooked up to my 4k tv.Bottom Line: This laptop is great and will absolutely shred anything you throw at it.

I consider myself fairly tech savvy, so when I heard all the controversy surrounding this model and its slower SSD, I was a little hesitant. After realizing what I wanted to do with the computer, this become a non-factor. I mostly do school (computer science) a little bit of rendering for my 3d printer and some very light gaming. The SSD has never been an issue in my day to day. If you are editing photos or access large files that will need to be read or written to often, maybe go to the 512GB model to get the faster SSD. If you are not working in CAD or video/photo editing all the time you will not care I promise. The rest of this machine has astounded me. 18 hours of battery life is not just marketing, the speed of the M2 is snappy and can handle much more than I thought it would. The new screen is gorgeous. Trackpad is the best on the market bar none. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever felt on a laptop and is an absolute joy to type on. MagSafe is back and amazing as before. Probably my favorite thing about this laptop, coming from a Windows gaming laptop is the lack of a fan. You will lose a little performance, but not having that noise is absolutely astounding.

The SSD is decent but there are faster drives out there, again for the price point not a big deal. 99% of your average consumers won't notice the IO difference between the onboard SSD and something more high end.The reason why I gave it only 4 stars was due to the fact I've had to return this model twice due to screen artifacts and bleeding. I'm not sure if I got 2 bad units in a 6 month span, but either way it's annoying. It's not extremely noticeable but when you're writing code, it can obscure your view.If the screen issues could be resolved, I'd buy another one in a second.

Other than some really minor issues with the software, the biggest cons I have experienced so far are with the hardware. First, the battery is pretty bad. It only lasts about 4 hours if you aren't pushing the laptop and it will last way less if you're doing anything like gaming or running more than 5 chrome tabs. Fortunately for me, I don't plan on moving this device around too much so I leave it near the charger. If you are expecting a better battery than this, good luck because either you pay way more money for a laptop with a better battery, or you buy this and deal with it because this is kind of the standard. Other than that expected fault, my unit came with some faulty ports. Specifically the USBs on the sides and the mic jack. The mic jack creates static noise through my headphones when plugged in and I know it's a hardware issue because having my hand on the chassis near the port silences the static meaning my hand is helping to ground the port. I haven't opened up the internals yet but I hope it's easily fixable. The USBs, especially the left one, are loose or something. Say I plug in a mouse-if I nudge the connector while in the port a bit, the mouse disconnects. The right USB does this less so I use that one. I haven't done any heavy gaming yet so I can't attest to its performance there yet, but so far the airflow during heavy usage seems good and the keyboard is very decent.

Handles everything I need professionally and everything I want for fun. As a gamer and designer, this gets it done.UPDATE - It was fun while it lasted. Stars have been reduced but only due to some nonsense. I bought this computer on 6/1/2020. Today is 2/28/21 and marks just at 8 months.Yesterday, one of the fans completely failed - with a very noisy and dramatic exit. Shortly after, the PC began to get very hot. I can't use it for work now. I can't (shouldn't) use it at all. It's loud and sounds like it is about to blow up.Reached out to the seller, and the seller recommended that I reach out to Acer - since it is still under factory warranty. That's not a good start. Acer has not responded yet and I do not have an Acer repair center in my state anyway, so it looks like I will be without this PC for several weeks either way.Not the best time for such an inconvenience. I have to order another computer to ensure I can still get my work done. NOT COOL! Essentially, a costly situation using money I was not prepared to spend. That's why I bought this unit - hoping I wouldn't run into such situations. But, I guess I'll end up with TWO expensive computers for the lesson. What was the lesson? Well, I should have gone with my first choice.If you look on the web, you'll find NUMEROUS forums talking about this unit's fan issues. I rolled the dice and lost. DO YOUR RESEARCH and have a backup if you take this road. I'll update you again and let you know whether I was taken care of by Acer.UPDATE 3/15/21 - The laptop returns after about two weeks - but not per the instructions that I had provided. It was sent to the wrong address and I needed to go chase it down. NOT COOL! It also came back with a few more scratches than I was prepared to see and the repair notes were vague at best. However, it does sound better and the fan seems to be working. Considering that I had to buy another laptop, I suppose this one will make a good gift.

I'm glad I did. I've been surprised at how very, very good this laptop is.Graphics - the RTX 3070 handles Cyberpunk (ray tracing off) at a consistent 75 fps, FFXIV on maximum settings runs at 140+ fps, GTA V on maximum settings runs at 80+ fps, Witcher 3 runs at 90+ fps, etc. all on max/ultra settings.Processor - I haven't run into anything that's slowed it down yet.RAM - 16GB has been fine. I haven't run into any need for more based on the games I play.Storage - the 512 GB turned out to be a little small for my needs, so I had to add a WD Black SSD and swap that to my main drive, though it's not MSI's fault that I didn't buy a big enough drive.Monitor - Has great blacks and contrast, but no touchscreen. I don't care about that, though.Build - the shell is made of a sort of brittle plastic that cracked with I was peeling the bottom off to add the new hard drive. Don't expect it to survive a drop.Battery - I honestly don't know. I wanted a laptop because I have a home base with a monitor and keyboard, but I also need to move from desk to desk where I always have a power supply. I rarely need to use it on the go, per se. I've read it can be low, though.So, based on my needs, I'm super happy with how this laptop performs. If you really wanted to spend an extra $2000+ to push those FPS into the 200+ range, I guess you could, but I don't really see the need.

For the tech savvy this is not that difficult, but has a number of drawbacks when placed in developer mode; 1) Every time the device boots, there is a large warning screen that the device is in developer mode and thus not secure. This screen incurs 30 second delay. 2) The device is no longer in secure mode. 3) If you do switch it back to secure mode, it \"power washes\" (factory reset) everything.However, I did read some rumors recently that Google considers to come with an update that would allow Android apps to be installed from non-Google-Play stores without developer mode.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

The speakers are one of the best features on this laptop by far. It's almost comparable to a Bose feel where the sound surrounds the room. There's only one major concern with this laptop and I'm sure it's just a cosmetic defect on the manufactures end. I can't get over a small raised bump on the touch pad itself. I've tried to scratch it down to no avail. It's incredibly difficult to ignore.This issue can be avoided with purchasing a mouse on the side. The laptop is very light and has a nice appeal to it. I feel for the price point you're getting a decent value. If you spend a bit more you can have a far better version of this laptop.Edit: Unfortunately I'm starting to hear the fans and the laptop itself getting hotter as weeks go by.

The core I7 8550U Kaby-Lake processor is the same one you'll find in most high-end laptops these days, and better that the Y processors in the new macbook air. It has a generous number of connections; full size HDMI, USB 3, Usb2.1 and USB-C (3.1 specs), along with a Micro-SD slot and a 3.5mm headphone /microphone jack. The screen is a non-touch 1080P and a backlit keyboard and fingerprint reader. All in a 2.6 lb (by my scale) aluminum package. I have read some criticism of the keyboard, but personally I find it as good as any laptop keyboard and have no complaints. But, I do not write novels or technical manuals for a living so my typing is pretty basic and your mileage may vary. The down-firing Harmon Kardon branded speakers are OK. But in my opinion, people who insist on blasting there speakers for sound either live alone or don't mind annoying people around them. I have always preferred headphones.Needless to say, for a laptop that is almost $400 cheaper than its rivals, there are some compromises. The screen is only HD and not the current QHD on most higher-priced laptops. But seriously, it is a 13\" screen. The text on 1080P is already tiny for my bifocal wearing eyes, how small would it be at 2560? That's not a deal breaker for me. The USB-C does not support power or display port. You still need the (standard ASUS) Power adapter to plug it in. There is only a 256GB SSD option and it is SATA-III. Finally it only comes with Win-10 Home, a Core I7 should have Pro. I did spend the money for a Pro upgrade.All things considered, it is hard not to like this laptop. For a light weight easy to transport laptop it is excellent The I7 CPU provides plenty of power for almost any portable use. The machine powers up quickly and smoothly, the fingerprint reader works flawlessly (for me). For my use, I just could not justify paying an extra $350 - 400 for a similarly spec'd laptop.

I can't say how many times I've gone to delete something and accidentally turned off the machine. 2) The ARROW keys are in a funky arrangement, and they are inappropriately sized.Update: May 2019. It's been two years since the purchase. I actually dropped the laptop about 4 feet, onto a concrete surface, twice. Once in 2018 and then two days ago. In the same place, separated by one year in time. The laptop still functions quite well. I have to say, I am impressed with it's durability and robustness.All in all though, I like the machine.

Anyone relying on their machine for a living or getting through college ought to consider buying more computer. Anyone who wants to play games should definitely spend more.That said, it can multi-task really well. I can run Virtual DJ while browser tabs are open to buy new tracks at a gig on the fly. That isn't a huge workload, but it's important to know a laptop at this price 5+ years ago would absolutely struggle with it with the older HDD setups.Why the low rating? Well, for $489, this is an absolutely horrible deal. First, it is three generations old now. It has a very small SSD capacity and only 8GB of RAM. 720P and not full HD 1080P screen. Onboard graphics. There is absolutely nothing about this laptop worth $500.HP beats itself with the same $400 model ($430 for the touch model), current gen, 256GB NVME!!!

I must say for the ASUS Zenbook Pro, this laptop series will fair well for good content creation and part-time video gaming.PS: This is for my Wife so I am jealous of her now!", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Giving you piece of mind if it were to get damaged during transit since almost everything on this device is cloud based (assuming you back everything up)You can install apps on it and not programs to the device (unless you jail break it, but then the specs is bad so you may have a bad time). It's basically a tablet with a keyboard and a google chrome browser which is attached to your google+ account and google drive accountIt has a nice textured grip on top, easy to grab and go.Keyboard is a bit cramped if you're used to traditional keyboards and you may mistype a lot of keys at first, but after a while your fingers will build muscle memory and everything will be fine. Instead of cap lock there's an instant search feature, but you can change it to caps lock in the settings. There's also no insert, home and delete button. Also no F (F1, F2, F3, etc) keys, but there are other built in shortcut keys along the topEntertainment wise, it's not good. Screen is great for productive tasks such as e-mail or typing up an essay, but for watching high definition videos it's sub par. Speakers are on the bottom of the chromebook which doesn't make sense as it muffles the sound. If you have background noise, such as TV running in the background, the TV may overshadow what's on the chromebook (depending on volume set on TV). You cannot play high end games on this device as there will be tons of lag, frame rate drops and/or crashes.Webcam is good. Not pixelated at all. Great for conferences. Skype doesn't work well, so you have to use hangouts or Google Duo.Battery life. If you do not use it for entertainment, it can last around 10+ hours. But if you watch a lot of youtube videos for example it'll drop down to half, around 5 or 6. It charges fairly quickly so you'll be up-and-running again in no timeAdapter it comes with is also portable. There's no power brick, but the plug that goes into wall or power brick socket may take up to 2.5 spaces depending on how you configure itOverall, great travel companion (whether it's a business trip or from class-to-class) for those on the productive side, as you can leave your main power use laptop safe at home. For the price, it's very good as long as the main usage is outside of entertainment (unless you consider writing essay and reports entertainment)", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

The laptop actually helped me fix it via diagnostics program. This laptop is great! Superfast! Pages load instantly - something I wasn't used to with my previous laptops.

Shortly after the warranty expiration period passed, the backlight on the screen stopped working. Upon dismantling the laptop I clearly saw the issue - the video display connector also housed the backlight power on the right-side of the ribbon cable (when facing the laptop from the side of the keyboard). The motherboard showed clear signs of electrical damage to this section of the ribbon and the connector was only partially intact. The side where the backlight power ran had burned itself completely off. Had I know of this quality limitation, I may have opened the machine up and taken steps to isolate the power (adding dielectric to the connector, or running simple bypass power lines for example). Honestly, I am surprised and dismayed that Lenovo cut corners on such a simple thing. Most laptops have a separate power connector - utilizing wire with a gauge suited to the application. The paper-thin ribbon and micro connector proved to be too small to handle the power current used by the display.

A year or two later, the glue holding the rubber feet onto the computer started melting from the computer's heat, causing them to start slipping off. I tried to attach them again with more glue, but it proved ineffective. I ended up just taking the feet off and putting rubber doorstops on the bottom of the laptop, which unfortunately prevents the screen from flipping around fully, something that was rather important to me. Now, after 2 or 3 years of owning this laptop, it seems as if the battery is swelling.

(I prefer this design better)- Red Backlit keyboard (Color cant be changed, but I wasnt specifically looking for a flashy laptop so this is just a plus)- Overall Matte Black texture around the laptop with pleasing MSI dragon logo on the back screen.- AntiGlare Screen- Num. Pad keyboard- Comes with 1 year manufacturer warranty(US) (You'll have to activate it online yourself.)Cons:- Although aesthetically pleasing, the Matte Black Plastic Finish is a FINGERPRINT/OIL magnet and takes more than just a dry cloth to remove- 8GB RAM (I intend to add on another 8GB stick in the nearby future)- Battery life is ridiculous when playing games- Fans are REALLY loud when playing games (Not much of a problem if you wear headphones, and is expected as it does a splendid job keeping the laptop cool)- Speakers are subpar (Again, not much of a problem if you wear headphones)Overall, I was in the market specifically for a laptop that had a good CPU/GPU, and both an SSD and HDD. I stumbled upon many competitor laptops along the same price range however, some were missing an SSD or HDD, or had the regular 1050 GPU which comes with only half (2GB) of dedicated memory of what the Ti model has (4GB). If I had purchased those laptops instead, and added on a separate SSD OR HDD, the total cost spent would be above $1000. The laptop is surprisingly light for a gaming laptop, and comes in a sleek yet aggressive theme, which wasn't what I was in the market for but is a plus to me. Most people who game on laptops would know that you get better frames while plugged in to the charger (This is due to bottlenecking of either the CPU or GPU demanding more power, yet the battery cannot provide that power alone), so the low gaming battery life is not much of a problem considering you should be plugged in to get the best performance, and the battery life outside of gaming is average (4-6 hours) depending on what work you'll be doing. Ultimately, the laptop met more than my needs and was in my price range ($899, $960~ after taxes), and I expect to be using it throughout and well after the years of college.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Another gripe would be the touchpad isn't as good as my previous MacBook, but that's not much of a surprise. Also the AC power supply is rather cheap, but I couldn't care less about that.

Prior to purchase, I used a 2007 MacBook Air which was slow and laggy, and close to its deathbed. Originally was looking at the new MacBook Pro, but I found this amazing beast of a laptop and never looked back. I purchased the GTX 1070 with 32GB storage and 512 SSD and it costed about 2500$ which is definitely on the pricier size but in comparison to the MacBook Pro 2018 model with 512 GB storage which runs about 2800$, the MSI is cheaper while also having an amazing 144hz monitor with a faster graphics card (GTX 1070 vs Radeon Pr 555). On the user ability side, the MSI GS65 is smooth and is easy to use straight out from the box. There is some bloat ware preinstalled but it\u2019s easy to remove either manually or using the clean start provided by the Windows software. I use this laptop for day to day college use and it\u2019s large screen (15.6\u201d vs. MacBook Pro 15.4\u201d) and relatively light weight (4.14lbs or 1.87kg) makes it easy to transport and use in any setting. I also have several big box games installed including Assassins Creed Odyssey and Destiny 2 and they run amazingly well. I\u2019ve heard that people have some problems with the build quality, including some creaking in around the touch pad, but I personally have not had this problem. If you do, amazon return is an easy fix! People also have said that it runs a bit hot, but I have not found this to be a problem as the fans do a great job at cooling it down to a comfortable heat when playing games. It is otherwise cool and completely silent when doing day to day tasks. If you\u2019re in the market for a new computer and value productivity as well as gaming, this laptop is definitely the right purchase for you. I found that the 32GB/512SSD storage option is the right size for me and if you play a decent amount of larger games, I\u2019d recommend this storage amount over anything else smaller.

Based on the build quality (it's sleek and feels great to type on even though no mechanical keyboard), its performance when gaming (mostly MMOs or FPS games), and how it handles multitasking (I run a BlueIris VMS server on it most of the day with about 7 PoE cameras recording through it), I can comfortably recommend it.The Victus handles Elden Ring on med-high graphics settings averaging 65-80 FPS, Fortnite at over 100FPS on high graphics settings, Halo infinite at 50-58 FPS on high settings, and various other AAA games at 60+ FPS @ 1080p on high graphics settings. If you turn the graphics settings down to low or medium-low you can max out the FPS (144hz for this panel) on older games like Fortnite or Dota 2. I was able to max out World of Warcraft TBC Classic as well on medium and low settings. This laptop has no trouble with large raids in WoW Classic or large battles in Halo Infinite on medium settings.I don't really notice any bottlenecks when I'm using it besides when I'm gaming and forget to change the recording settings of my PoE cams in BlueIris. You can complete most productivity oriented tasks with this laptop such as data analysis with 20,000+ row excel files, editing videos while completing coursework, and more. This would be a good dev laptop as well even though the specs aren't super overpowered.The HP Omen button on the keyboard opens up the HP Omen Gaming hub which lets you configure different profiles for optimizing performance while gaming or battery life while using the laptop for normal tasks. I kind of wish it had a dedicated overclock button like other gaming laptops but it's easy enough to toggle the mode to performance and max out the fan using the HP Omen Gaming Hub.The keyboard feels satisfying to type on. It has a full numpad as well. The chassis feels pretty solid. I like the smooth finish on the top of the laptop. The speakers are actually excellent. I like the tuning and enjoy listening to music from them even though I have my larger bookshelf speakers right behind my laptop and triple monitors. They did a good job with the user experience.Thankfully this is a semi-repairable laptop as well. You can easily open up the bottom of the chassis and add/remove/upgrade the ram, replace the battery after a few years, or nvme SSD. The ports included are generous and allow for easily outputting to two extra monitors though you will need a usb-c to hdmi converter. It would've been nice if it had thunderbolt as well but it still works well as is and thankfully has an ethernet port.I've included some benchmarks here as well. For me it's a great gaming laptop, I'd say a 4.5/5, not quite perfect but good enough for my needs. The laptop feels fairly premium which makes me have confidence in its long-term durability even though it has a fair bit of plastic.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

After using it exclusively for 3 months for everything, here are my thoughts.Pros:-Looks and feels amazing, very thin and portable.-Has a really nice backlit keyboard.-Boots very fast due to SSD having OS.-The extra 4gb of vram in the GPU come in handy.-Edits videos extremely well due to the i7.-Played all my games just fine on high settings.-Speakers are awesome.Cons:-The screen is lackluster but not too bad.-The laptop scratches and dings VERY easily.-The laptop will run very hot and rather loud under load, however I\u2019ve NEVER had it shut down on me due to overheating. It\u2019s ran under full load for hours upon hours on end. Be sure to have on hard flat surface for good airflow.-Battery life is pretty bad due to the high performance components inside and the battery not being very big.Overall in my opinion the pros outweigh the cons big time here.

I have been getting weekly BIOS updates and none has resolved the issue.2a) When connected to charger:Using Hardware monitoring tool, I can see that even under normal usage of Office applications, the laptop is over clocking to above 3 GHz (instead of staying below, much much below even the 2.0 GHz. No amount of configuratin in BIOS or even using Intel's XTU (Extreme Tuning Utility) has resolved the over clocking.As a result, the temperate is always between 60-70C and results in fan running nearly all the time.This will also significantly reduce the life of laptop.2b) When not connected to charger,There is no over clocking (Good!) but CPU still keeps running at almost full power of 2.0 GHz and this reduces battery life to barely 4 hours (screen brightness 80).Both 2a and 2b point to crappy software by Lenovo and crappy updates that have failed to make any dent.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I keep buying them because they are, in my view, the best all-purpose laptops out there. Lightweight, perfect for travel, extremely reliable and fast - this laptop is an incredible value for the price. Love the anti-glare screen (needed because I have sensitive eyes). The laptop arrived super fast but because of annoying Windows 10 updates, it was a few hours before I was able to actually use the machine. Despite complaints from others, my laptop runs very quietly. And although some reviews recommend this laptop only for \"light\" video editing, I have already done extensive editing and video rendering without any issues at all. My only complaint is the small 250 GB hard drive, but understandable at this price point. Be sure to carry plenty of external storage and you'll be in great shape with this amazing laptop.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Didn't go as smoothly as I was starting it up for the first time. When I was setting my new password for some reason the \"5\" key on the numpad was not working, however it is miraculously working now. Also after noticing there was an update, I updated the laptop and when it was booting back up, after the log on screen it was just a black screen that wouldn't go away. I shut it off two times with no progress. However, after shutting off the laptop for the third time I decided to remove the Mouse usb, when I turned it back on it went back to normal and started as if nothing happened. It hasn't happened again. So that was a bit of a setback. Besides that, I've been having a smooth experience with the laptop. It's pretty fast. I will test the gaming aspect some time soon.UPDATE 2: I've had the laptop for a few months now, it's working very smoothly, it's fast when starting up, and I've had no major issues. I haven't tried playing any newer 'heavy' games but the witcher 2, LA NOIRE, murdered soul suspect, maple story, and skyrim run extremely well on it. I also use a drawing tablet on the laptop and I haven't had any issues with that either. It runs good.

It's great for gaming if you want this laptop to never last then go ahead let it push and die in a year. I played games like hell let loose, halo infinite, elden ring, assassin's creed valhalla and also do a lot of rendering work and while it's normal for these games to get these laptops hot, this thing went up to 90c to 100c hot. This is with a cooling pad, and the fan running at turbo and some how managed to hit tjmax. The build is decent and has seen some abuse such as accidentally dropping it a few times and never noticing any substantial drop in performance. On the other hand, too bad it'll drop in performance anyways when the interior gets so hot that it needs turbo on all the time as the cpu gets so hot that it lowers the clock speed to save itself. Also, The predator button is the stupidest design choice i've ever seen and the program itself manages to take 20% of cpu load and make the laptop hotter by having the program running by itself. I don't care if I can change the predator button's settings, as having it where the num lock is annoying and shows how much acer cared about keyboard design when they first made this.Also installing ssd wasn't bad, but the tutorials are much like acer's monitor quality: bad. Didn't show me where to stick the slim thing to open up the laptop so i can install another ssd in there.For what it's worth and almost a year with this thing and I have a lot of resentment with this laptop, and that i'll use it until it dies and then go elsewhere.UPDATE: Oh yeah I forgot about about the overly sensitive mousepad. It's so bad that they thought adding the FN + f2 key would fix an obvious awful design issue that they think a bandage will prevent frustrations. If I Have to press fn + f2 key every time I had to switch from gaming to internet surfing to gaming then why should I even bother buying a laptop to begin with? That thing is neck deep almsot near the space bar that it gets in the way of communication.

Called the support line and there was nothing to be done about it but get it replaced with another unit (since it was literally less than 2 weeks old)I decided against as I want dual monitors out, it is staying at home at all times and if it can die so easily I'd rather roll the dice with something else, at the very least I am glad it died this early and not one day after the warranty.Long story short, if you get one that works it seems to be excellent at the mobile aspect of a gaming laptop but falls short for a \"Mobile Workstation\" so choose wisely.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

It's super fast, easily keeps its framerates up without trying, has a battery life unlike any laptop I've owned before, and honestly it has just enough of that \"gamer aesthetic\" to look cool without looking like Megatron's codpiece like most other gaming laptops these days.Cons: the built-in monitor is a 60Hz display, so your framerates aren't going higher despite it easily having the spare power to do so with a better monitorThe legion logo on the back of the screen that lights up cannot be turned off, so if you play in a dark room and prefer doing so, prepare to have a beacon in the middle of your room.It's kind of a nitpick, but the soft touch material picks up oils from your skin and smudges really easily. It's not hard to clean, but it does make me add a step of \"wipe this thing down\" before packing it up to go to a friend's house, which is a minor annoyance.And now for the only real problem I have with it. It severely limits how much power the GPU can use if it's on battery. I'll be at a static 60 frames, and checking my stats, the GPU isn't taxed AT ALL with a handful of modern games, but then if the computer becomes unplugged, it locks the screen at 30 frames per second. I can tell that it doesn't seem limited to games either, because something seems slightly off with my otherwise vibrant display when it's unplugged, but I know it hadn't dimmed or anything.

The backlit keyboard is comfortable, screen crisp and trackpad responsive. The i7 processor and Iris Xe graphics are very capable, but severely hampered by totally inadequate heat management, leaving the user unable to take full advantage of them in demanding applications for long.Form FactorThis is a beautiful little laptop. The design is simple and straightforward, with silver coloring all over. It\u2019s svelte; very thin and light. Opening the lid, the computer lifts up a bit in the back, settling on some rubberized feet on the lower lip of the monitor, creating some built-in keyboard elevation. The keyboard is comfortable. Layout is excellent, with no keys being oddly sized in a way that would throw off your touch typing. The trackpad is a little small, but does the job. Standard gestures are easily tracked without issue. Backlight shows through key labels nicely; it automatically shuts off after a minute of non-use, but can be changed to user preference.ScreenThe screen is small--this is an ultraportable laptop--but aspect ratio is comfortable. The screen is bright and clear, even when on light gaming duty or reading text. You also get a Thunderbolt and full-sized HDMI port which you can use to hook up to a full-sized monitor if you need a little more visual real estate.ConnectivityThe wifi speed for this laptop is outstanding. Connecting to a 5ghz network with good signal will get you some excellent download speeds (dependent on your provider\u2019s data speeds, of course). I downloaded a 75 GB game in under 25 minutes over wifi. It\u2019s pretty nice.PerformanceThis is a mixed bag. You\u2019ve got a machine with an i7 processor and the Iris Xe graphics--these on their own have solid performance, even when it comes to playing a lot of modern games on respectable (if not ultra) settings or doing high-def video editing. On the other hand, you\u2019ve only got 8 GB of RAM and the limited heat management that comes with an ultra-portable. What you end up with is a total package that can\u2019t take advantage of its full potential.As a stress test, I ran World of Warcraft: Shadowlands at max settings to see what kind of frame rate I could get. It was actually playable at 25 fps\u2026 not fantastic, but for an integrated GPU, not bad. I played for about 15 minutes before the laptop froze up. The fan never sped up as fast as it should have to manage the heat, and with only one small vent toward the top of the keyboard, it folded under the load. I quit out and the computer cooled down quickly. I was able to resume play on medium settings (4 custom on the slider) and kept that up for about 40 minutes without issue, but it was disappointing to know that the potential was there, just out of reach.Granted, this isn\u2019t a gaming rig. But, the description does indicate use for things like video editing and demanding business applications. There may be some walls you\u2019ll hit in terms of performance in some situations that the CPU should be capable of.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

So to the best of my knowledge, even though this is sold and shipped by a 3rd party seller, it DOES appear to be a NEW genuine part that has NOT been tampered with. (I bring this up because I remember seeing another review where they accused the seller of selling a fraudulent/used product.)After unboxing, my first thought was \"Dang, this thing is big.\" But this is NOT a fault of the product. I was just used to an 11\" notebook, not a 15\" work machine. For its size, this laptop is slim, light, and stylish. My only complaint about the product's appearance is that the 'lid' is a fingerprint magnet, easily getting smudged. The included charger is a Type-C 65w charger, so to those who LOVE USB-C, this is definitely a plus. Personally, I don't like the small connector for a laptop. I definitely prefer the older style Lenovo plug.After I got the laptop set up, I was surprised at the screen in particular. This thing looks GREAT. It almost looks better than my 29\" ultrawide that my main PC runs on. The software is snappy, and the only bloatware I found was McAfee. PLEASE, Lenovo, stop using this! McAfee is a HORRIBLE antivirus that eats CPU for breakfast, lunch AND dinner. Outside of that, there is no major bloat, so you're getting VERY close to a vanilla Windows experience.The hardware is a good spec: Ryzen 7 3700u, Vega 10 integrated graphics, 8gb of RAM, 256gb SSD. But let's stop on the RAM for a minute. 2gb of your RAM is dedicated to your graphics. This means that you're limited to 6gb for the OS. Windows will use 3, so you're pretty much out of luck if you use any software that uses a lot of RAM (Chrome, anyone?) Thankfully, there is a second RAM slot available, and it's reasonably easy to access. (Lenovo is also reasonable as far as warranty is concerned) While I'm on the subject, there is also a spare 2.5\" hard drive bay inside the machine, so if you need more storage there's an upgrade path there as well.The keyboard is nothing to write home about, but I find it comfortable to work with, and I can type very close to full speed with minimal errors. It's tactile, quiet, and spacious; something my old Yoga 11e couldn't provide.This is getting long, so I'll summarize. This laptop is everything you would expect out of a $600 ThinkPad. It will get anything done that you need it to, as long as you upgrade the RAM.

Granted in the last 10-12 years my system builds have become a bit more budget minded due to having a family and other responsibilities.

The screen is amazing, the RGB keyboard is hypnotizing (according to my wife and kids) the power of the CPU&GPU is extremely good. Everything I have thrown at it has run great 100+ FPS. I also really like the MSI tool for adjusting gaming mode, I was able to run it on silent playing Assassins Creed Odyssey with barely a hitch in the graphics and not a peep from the fans so my family could watch TV and not hear fans all night. Even in normal mode with the fans allowed to adjust automatically my son's comment regarding the fans was \"This laptop sounds like it's talking where your old laptop was screaming\" lol My only critique is the screen has a bit of light bleed at the edges when it's at max brightness but this might just be mine. I haven't contacted MSI support yet to find out if this is normal. Overall I am very satisfied with my choice, I looked at several other gaming laptops in this price range and kept hearing how good the MSI was and knowing MSI has had a very good reputation for a very long time it was't hard to make the leap.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Quite snappy and brilliant display. Try to go back to owner log in and you get instant screen blink in and out, 4 - 6 cycles and then reboot and log in screen.I thought it was a glitch in the Google settings so we tried multiple accounts logging in first and same thing everytime. Powerwashing unit by secondary user and trying again. I have a family of 5 and I know everyones log in information so i tried them all. Every user after the first would wotk fine, first on the machine and it is utteraly un-usable.I gave it 2 stars because a D.O.A. computer is not unheard of but this is clearly not shipping damage.

It's not a Switch, you'll have to plug in the laptop to get the most out of modern games, but it's perfect when it's plugged in.You'll want a gaming mouse, a headset, and a controller to go with this. If you have a second monitor, I'd recommend a G-sync or FreeSync monitor to make sure you're not letting any of those precious frames go to waste.Nitpicks -Speakers are quiet, fan is loud. When the fan is blasting, it becomes difficult to hear what's going on in the game. Can't do much about the fan - you've got to cool the GPUs and CPUs.

I do also love the additon of the side number keypad as I occasionaly work with numbers and it makes it so much easier. I hope that the glitches I had in the beginning were just out of the norm and this will be a future proof laptop!!", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I never expected the sucker to be stronger than my desktop rig! Originally, I had planned on upgrading my desktop with the new nvidia 3000 series but now I'm content.Now for the juicy, seasoned, succulent details. Food remarks are weird for tech reviews, right? Wrong, because with the amount of power this bad boy has it'll cook anything in the way of those heat exhaust fans. Friends have told me, \"there's now way that thing has a full rtx 2070 in there. It HAS to be throttled back.\" Wrong. The amount of heat this thing dishes out is enough to make my ever freezing, anemic girlfriend comfortably warm. That's saying a lot. Not so much as con as to be expected but just to point out the obvious, where shorts at the least or make sure there's some thick material between the Leopard and your skin. And gentlemen? Keep it away from your junk area.Now, for the reason it's putting out so much heat, starting from the top.Game 1: Hades.Supergiant's colorfully bombastic and wonderfully artistic game was the perfect warm up for the Leopard. With battery alone, it ran it decent but with a noticeable dip in performance while maintaining the high visual quality. But plug in that power supply and the heavens themselves seem to reach down and fill the Leopard with holy powers, purging the evil in all who gaze upon it. It's fantastic, the screen butter smooth at 144hz and making me laugh manically as I stared in awe at how well it performed. So, completely satisfied, I moved onto putting it through it's first REAL task.Game 2: Monster Hunter: World w/ IceborneWas a little worried when it first loaded up and I noticed my character was slightly blurry, but that's just from the resolution scaling (I think) than anything else. Because going back to settings, I made sure everything was on high and/or max. Loading up into the Selliana gatthering hub, everything looked great, frames were smooth as Hades and the graphics were top notch. But let's be real, that wasn't pushing it to it's limits. Not really. I did what every Hunter does in their sacred quest of slaughtering innocent hulking beasts minding their own business.I travelled to the Ancient Forest and slayed the shit out some poor Great Jagras, all for the sake of limit testing. Everything was smooth, creatures in the distance flapped their wings without pixelating. My cloak trailed behind me casting shadows as I ran. The crisp outlines of the grass and leaves brushing against my skin or bobbing gently in the wind was when I realized that the power the Leopard has is beyond incredible. When that Jagras died on the shore, I thanked it for it's sacrifice for progress and exited my game for quiet contemplating.Monster Hunter is a poorly optimized game. It does NOT run well on most people computers, and certainly not 60 frames per second. The Leopard roared at the shitty engine implantation and forced the game itself to bend to it's will, forcing it run better than it had any right to. But, there's one more game I wanted to test, just in time too...Game 3: Baldur's Gate: 3Wow. Just... wow. Character look fantastic, the moment to moment character interactions looked like cutscenes with the excellent amount of mo-cap and an extraordinary high quality voice acting. Even in Early Access, it looks fantastic and runs melted butter smooth. Except for when there's bugs and right now there's a lot of 'em, but no fault on the computer itself.I can't say anything bad about it, other than the speakers but c'mon, that's what headphones are for! They don't sound cheap or anything, just sound isn't as good without some bass and it's a laptop so don't expect a surround sound experience. Honestly, I just giggle and appreciate the fact that the LED lit keyboard is in itself a audio visualizer. Totally unneccessary features like that just goes to show how much fun this thing is and I haven't had my inner child squeal in such excitement since the day I bought my first 4k TV 3 years ago when it was on sale.Leopard > 4k TVNot much else to say after all that. If you have the money and were hesitating on whether it was worth the purchase price, I'll tell you they should be charging more and I wouldn't blame them. This has the power of something that should be almost $1700 or more, but you're getting a steal so strike while you can!", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I'm glad I kept it, because I despise this computer. It's pretty to look at and it's super light and that's about all the positive I can muster on it.Probably doesn't help that I'm posting while pissed as my main issue with this computer just happened yet again - while gaming, the computer keyboard just stops working. I think it overheats and then it doesn't matter what key you hit, nothing works. I have to hit the power button to be able to log semi-restart and it seems to jog the computer into working again. I've not played GW2 on it, but some Blizzard games in HoTS and WoW and both games had this happen. Not good when you're trying to PvP on a team and have to drop. In WoW, I'm just doing normal PvE and this happens.The computer runs stupid hot, I've never had my other do this at all. I had read about it, but figured it was an exaggeration and nope. It's also loud. LOUD. Like I thought the computer was going to just eat it right there loud. It's fine while surfing the web and even Photo Shop, but any kind of gaming just sends it (and me) into fits. I would say the keyboard thing will happen a few times a week. Going to have to spring for a fan to see if it helps, but I may just go back to my old RoG and use this on the couch for trivial things. SO disappointed, ASUS.March 24 update - Have a fan for this damn thing and it still overheats. At this point I might as well try a block of ice underneath it. The keyboard still stops randomly and it happens without a high graphic load now. It makes my headphones cut out once it gets hot and has rendered two pair (one old set I replaced as I thought maybe it's just time and then it did the same to the new pair about 2 hours into gaming and no one in discord could hear a full sentence) This thing is built for gaming, so why all the damn problems?

With normal operation everything works good and no problems but when I game on it the temps would get up to 98 degrees Celsius which is hot.

So I called Asus and told them my problem and they were willing to help me, but I am currently in online college for software engineering and this was at the time my only computer so I could not send it in for repair like they wanted me to because I could not miss school. Asus really had no real solution to my problem other than take it to a computer specialist and have it fixed which would be no different than sending it to Asus. So me being the the computer specialist I am I took upon myself to fix it. So what I did was take it apart and use liquid metal on the cpu and the gpu heat sinks and the result was amazing, it was running 20 degrees Celsius cooler wow. Also dont leave your charger behind this laptop dont last long on a charge.

If you need something to check email, browse the web, and maybe stream a video, AND you understand that this isn't a regular laptop for doing real work on, then this may be just what you need. I use it only to interface with my cars computer. The change from Win 10s to regular Win10 Home is super easy and a non issue. What is the issue is that today Microsoft announced that Microsoft's latest Windows 10 update (version 1903), coming out in May will need almost double the storage space than it did last time for its October 2018 Update (version 1809). Users running the 32-bit version see the requirement jump from 16GB to 32GB and those running the 64-bit version also need a minimum of 32GB, an additional 12GB of space from the previous baseline of 20GB. And that's the total of what this little laptop has. That means that the OS may not be upgraded or if it does, there will be nowhere to store ANY apps. You could use a thumb drive, but this is if the OS will install at all with a 32gb drive. One may be left with the pre-installed OS and no upgrades (think security and bug fixes) in the future.

Wanting a laptop and not necessarily another Windows machine, I thought I'd try Chrome OS. Wow, I'm impressed so far, set up was an easy, quick process, about ten minutes. To me, when web browsing, it reminds me of Windows and the file manager more like Android in how to move files around etc, which I'm comfortable with, although Windows Explorer is okay too. I had a mouse plugged in at first because it was easier to use during setup, but now I've read the manual and have learned how to do everything with the track pad, which works well and keeps the computer highly portable. The best is it has no bloatware on it like some devices, my version has 4 gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of internal storage, along with the micro SD card I installed gives me way more potential than i need. In short, so far i love this device. How can they pack so much value in, i paid $179.00 delivered. My .02 cents at least.

I need a built in sd card reader and for whatever reason companies are not including them on 17inch laptops despite having ample room to do so.I have never had any luck with acer. Everything I have ever bought from them has been garbage... even back to the emachines/gateway days. Against my own good judgment I gave them one last try cause the price was just too enticing. I regret this big time.The machine blew a capacitor in two weeks of use. It would work on battery, but not plugged in. I have never experienced anything like this on any of the dozens of laptops I have owned. Worst off it died when I was on location with 100s of hours of footage to edit. I ran the machine hard for a week before I left hoping that if it died, it would do so at home, but it chose the worst possible time to die. I had to edit my footage 1.5 hours at a time, then charge the battery for two hours before I could start again. Not fun.Then the RMA horrors began. I was within 30 days; nonetheless, Amazon does not allow you to simply return the machine for a new one. They only offer repair options. If I had bought the machine from best buy, I would have simply walked into any best buy in america and gotten a new machine and if they did not have one in stock, I could have selected a new machine to replace it. Not so with Amazon. If I had bought a macbook, I would just walk into an apple store and they would either fix it on the spot or just give me a new one. Thus, I had to wait two weeks for Acer to replace my mainboard. Giving me only a few days to run the machine through its paces before my next video editing gig. They refused to give me a new machine, despite the warranty saying that I could be given a new machine. They sent the machine back without my oem box which significantly drops my resale value in the future and if I need to send it back in for repair I have no sure way of sending it back without fear of it being damaged in shipment. They yelled at me on the phone. I yelled at them back. The machine was not reassembled properly as the plastic bottom had not been fully clipped back in. The screen seemed to have hot spots it did not have before. Predator sense overclocking was broken because the software is tied to the mainboard and when your mainboard is replaced, the software is broken. Thus, the machine cannot reach its max turbo-core. It is stuck at 2.6 ghz cause the fans cannot be turned up. It regularly hit 95c, though it does not throttle below its base clock.This company also has the worst website of any manufacturer. They do not give you any repair instructions. They do not give you any qvl lists on ram or ssd compatibility. They do not list the maximum ram capacity. They do not list the maximum ram speed or timings.Beyond that, the laptop has an awful trackpad. It somehow has usb 2.0 ports in 2019. Seriously? The usb 3.1 chipset gives very inconsistent transfer speeds. It also has laughable battery size for such a large machine.I hate this machine. I hate Acer and Acer hates you too.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Despite that high wattage video card, the fans don't run hard when they are set to the regular \"automatic\" mode. You can press a button at the top right of the keyboard that forces the fans to run at full speed but so far it has not been necessary. I don't run super intensive games with it, Just WoT, and WoWs, as well as Armored Warfare and Warthunder. I will update this review once I have played something more intensive. So far though, in the games mentioned above, I get 150+ fps with everything on highest settings at 1920x1080P and 144hz. Not bad for a laptop, especially considering the fans on auto rarely go above a low rpm.The first laptop I received had an obvious problem with the graphics chip heat sink fan. It ran hot as hell, even with the fans forced to run at full speed, and it crashed very frequently in games no matter the measures I took.The speakers aren't bad, for a laptop. You can watch a movie on the built-in speakers if you turn the volume up all the way, just don't expect anything more than \"ok\" sound quality and volume. Its acceptable for a laptop, thats about it. The keys feel as though they are slightly convex. Because of this, my fingers always feel as though they are sliding everywhere on the keys, probably because they are. The keys when pushed in have a nice positive feel to them which loans some tactility back to the keyboard. The right-side shift key is annoyingly short, but I will get used to it I hope. The backlighting works well, with the led light showing up through the keys so you can read the letters in the dark as opposed to cheap led backlit keyboards that only have the led lights under the keys, but they don't shine up through the keys. The wireless X card is stupid fast; I was getting sustained download speeds of 22Mb/sec, and it may be capable of more though I haven't checked what the theoretical speeds are. The bluetooth works well with very minimal sound lag while watching youtube videos using a bluetooth (4 or 5...not sure which) speaker. There are several driver updates from MSI as of this writing, and a BIOS update as well. The UEFI BIOS is a bit sparse in options compared to a nice desktop motherboard wherein you can adjust all kinds of clock speeds, voltages, and bus speeds as well as tons of other stuff (DRAM timing, split bank speed on and on), you don't have any of that capability in this BIOS. The NVMe drive is a liteonit CL1-8D512. Its probably middle of the road insofar as speed though this is obviously anecdotal. My western digital Black 512gb in my desktop is a little faster. Don't forget, you can add an internal SSD or 2.5\" hard drive to this laptop. That is kinda cool. Battery life is pretty average under light loads such as internet browsing and typing, I get about 5 hours. Thats not bad considering that this laptop is not an ultra-portable unit with an ultra low power processor and screen. I wish it had G-sync or at least a way to disable the intel graphics, and I wish it had another USB 3.1 gen 2 (type A or C, whichever) port. I think that by now, all chipsets should be running all 3.1 gen 2 (10gbit/sec) by this point.

I first replaced the 16gb of ram with 32gb (16x2) of Crucial Ballistix 3200 MHz SODIMM DDR4 DRAM as I plan on doing video editing. You can find it here @ https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B083W5ZRJ1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. I suggest updating the Intel Wi-Fi driver as the download and upload speeds didn't meet my expectations. I had to visit Intel's site to download the driver as the laptop stated I had the latest. There is a problem with the camera and have submitted an e-ticket with Lenovo to provide a fix. They are supposed to reply back within 24 hours, but I have yet to hear from them. :-( Otherwise, my experience with the laptop has been good. Boot up is quick. The sound is really decent for a laptop. As far as gaming, I have only played RBI Baseball 2020 and it looked really good with no lag. The fans are fairly quiet as they don't drown out the speakers when running. All programs have booted up quickly and so far I haven't had to reboot due to any program freezing. All in all, I'm really satisfied. I will revisit the review if any other problems arise.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I bought this after using an Alienware 17 for several years. The Alienware was super bulky and heavy - built like a tank - and had cooling issues. In fact, the wiring actually melted inside and fried the hard drive, even though I used a cooling pad (which is a common issue with those per reviews).But THIS laptop I've had now for over 6 months and it runs amazing. I recently upgraded RAM, which I highly recommend if you're going to be gaming - 16 or more. Also love that it has an open 2.5\" SSD slot - adding a 500gb SSD SATA III today in the open slot. 500GB is great if you're only playing one game or lightweight games, but anything hefty will eat up a lot of the space. For example, CoD Cold War needs 250gb, but I play 4-5 games so altogether they're more than the out-of-box SSD can handle for storage. Upgrading RAM + SSD was about 120 after tax and easy to upgrade! Playing WoW, I can run on max graphics even in 40-man BGs with 60FPS. I plan on using this for years and am very impressed with how lightweight this is and how well this runs. **Great value** for a gaming laptop.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I had to spent a couple of hours though talking to amazon costumer service to send it back, because I needed to send it back to the US, which involves a little bureaucracy.I got a replacement unit in a very short time (so points for amazon, because their delivery service was very good), but after 2 and a half months it won't turn on anymore.I read the bad online reviews - and as of today, 50% of them are 1 star reviews - but I thought it was only because some people are unlucky.

I spent a lot of time reviewing newegg, bestbuy and amazon for top sellers, along with pcreviews and notebookcheck dot net (which does incredible detailed reviews showing how much heat and noise a laptop generates). I settled on this notebook and am very happy with what I got. The 2018 version is definitely worth the extra $50 over the 2017 version because the bezel (plastic border around the screen) is much smaller resulting in a laptop that is 10% smaller than the 2017 version while maintaining a 13\" screen! The faint high pitched noise put out by the motherboard is only detectable in a silent room when you place your head within 12\" of the keyboard. The battery life is stellar. Under load, the system hardly generates any heat and under light use (browsing/Word), I never hear the fan kick in. This 8th generation i5 is much more powerful than older i7 CPU's. It's incredibly thin. I was worried about the laptop looking 'gold' but it doesn't - it looks very silver with a faint hue.

Two of my must haves were that the machine have a non-glossy screen and no touchscreen! (I have seen too many cracked touchscreens on laptops... I leave them to tablets and phones.) I added a second 256 gb SSD and installed Linux Mint on it, so I can dual boot and eventually kick Windows for good. The build quality is very solid and unlike a lot of laptops, you can actually use it in your lap without it frying your thighs! I did have a small problem with the screen not wanting to turn on a couple of months ago. I am a computer repair tech, so I opened it up and reseated both ends of the video cable after disconnecting the battery and that sorted it out.

The only complaint and why I didn't give it 5 stars, is it runs pretty hot. I recently replaced the stock thermal paste with high quality paste meant to handle even extreme setups. It brought the cpu temp down about 8\u00b0. Diablo 3, The Witcher 3, FFXIV, etc.. All runs at a decent temp on higher settings. FFXV turns my Nitro into a supernova at medium settings even with the new thermal paste (will frequently spike to 93\u00b0-96\u00b0). Other than that it'll play any new game on the market at medium graphics with a decent fps and it'll play most games at medium to max settings at a good fps. I'd recommend replacing the stock thermal paste asap.All in all, for the price I would highly recommend this laptop. Just don't expect to be playing something like Cyberpunk higher than medium with anything higher than 30-40 fps.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Seems like this is a known issue with this computer, which I now no longer use.I've downgraded the rating to 3 stars on account that problem. Otherwise, still was a nice unit.Original review:Only 4 stars due to the plastic outer shell, which feels just a bit chintzy, albeit durable enough. Next to my iMac pro, this feels like a toy, but granted, ~1/2 the cost. As someone may have mentioned in a separate review, the edges do feel a bit sharp at times and depending on the angle I am resting my wrists at, I can feel the sharpness of the edges after a while.It would have been nice to allow for keyboard back-lighting dimming, rather than just an all-or-nothing option, as the lighting is either on or off. It would also have been nice if the screen could dim all the way to total darkness, or even a few increments darker than it actually gets, as using it at nighttime (while my wife tries to sleep) is tricky as the ambient light is still fairly bright, even at the lowest setting.Otherwise, this item has performed remarkably well, thus far.My last HP laptop lasted my almost 10 years, and with sustained, daily usage. I trust the HP name/brand and hope that this one lasts a lengthy time as well.Overall, money well spent.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Return 1 (contains new requirements) or 0 (does not contain new requirements).\n", "input": "I wanted to try this laptop because I was attracted to the design style and overall power included for gaming. I'm not a gamer - but wanted to benefit from the graphics and processing speed that would be included.The overall look and design did not disappoint. I love the red highlights and back lighting- very cool. The laptop itself is a little bulky - but I don't plan on carrying it around, so that's not a large concern for me.It was incredibly easy to set it up - ready to use in under 5 minutes.So far I love the brightness of the screen and the speed of loading web pages and apps in Windows 10.The only thing I don't love about the computer are the following:Placement of DC power cord. It's in the middle on the right side. I found it very difficult to insert the plug. I'm worried that I will break something over time with continued use - I'll update my review if that happens.The other thing I don't love (could be user error) is that the keyboard back lighting won't stay on. I love it when I start typing and the lighting turns on - I'd like to try to figure out if there is a setting to keep the light on when the computer is powered on. The keyboard is very dark without it - so I found myself struggling to find the right key I wanted before the lighting turned on. I'll continue my own research on that but wanted to include it in my initial review as it seems like that should be a standard feature to have the default setting be \"on\" and then offer the ability to adjust from there.5 star rating for overall look and design, operating speed, graphics and cost.Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I'm certainly not a computer \"expert\" so this is the viewpoint of an average consumer. I hope it was helpful to you as you make your purchasing decision. If you are looking for a great priced / powerful computer for everyday use - this is an excellent option to consider.Take care and happy shopping!", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Return 1 (contains new requirements) or 0 (does not contain new requirements).\n", "input": "This review is for the following laptop (since there are a few variants on this listing): \"Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-54-760S Gaming Laptop | Intel i7-11800H | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU | 15.6\" Full HD 144Hz 3ms IPS Display | 16GB DDR4 | 512GB SSD | Killer WiFi 6 | RGB Keyboard\"I am a lifelong gamer, and a few years ago I picked up a Dell gaming laptop that was in about the same price range as this one. That laptop was a disappointment for me and just immediately made me wish I had something better, so I ended up getting a top of the line desktop to replace it. I say this because I've had a gaming laptop void in my life, and was a little bit skeptical of laptops in this price range, but was still interested to give this one a whirl.At first I was a little worried. The shipping box was partially crushed. Fortunately, Acer did a really spectacular job with the laptop packaging. Inside the shipping box is another relatively plain brown box, which looks like nothing special. Opening that, and you see a black box for the laptop, and, to my surprise, a neoprene style laptop sleeve for this laptop. Inside the black box is ANOTHER black box, very well packed, with the laptop inside of a fabric bag. I know the unboxing experience is not really all that critical, but I must say, I was very pleased and impressed with how this was all packed. If this were being gifted to someone, I'd probably open the brown box and wrap up the Predator branded black box that comes inside, and wrap the sleeve separately.The sleeve it comes with has a zipper on it, and an Acer predator logo on one corner. It's a basic sleeve, a nice touch that it's included, but I will admit I have a bit of a phobia of these kind of sleeves, worrying that the zipper will scratch the laptop on the way in or out of the sleeve. I have been using it though, and so far so good.After removing the laptop from the fabric bag it comes packed in, I was a little surprised at a few things. I typically expect a gaming laptop (especially \"budget\" ones) to be thick, bulky, oversized, heavy... and this one is none of those things. It's by no means compact or light, but it's just overall slimmer, thinner, and lighter than I anticipated. I was also really surprised at the finish. The back side of the screen, and the inside of the laptop by the keyboard is all metal and just looks and feels very nice. The budget Dell gaming laptop I have is thicker, heavier, and all plastic, so this was just a pleasant surprise.Powering the laptop on, there's a loud airplane taking off sound (not the fans) that plays during bootup. I haven't figured out how to turn that off. Windows 10 setup was simple, the only thing notable was during the setup I was prompted to create an Acer ID and register the device, and there was no way to bypass or skip it. The text on the screen actually referenced being able to skip it, but I couldn't see any way to actually do that, so I had to provide a name and email to give to Acer to get in to Windows for the first time, which I wasn't crazy about.After setup, I had about 429gb of free space on my first boot into Windows. Another thing that surprised me was that there wasn't an overwhelming amount of extra stuff installed. The extra stuff that I noticed was:- Dropbox Promotion- Firefox with Amazon Assistant Plugin (also noticed Firefox had a \"Allow firefox to install and run studies\" option turned on)- Facebook Messenger- ExpressVPN- Norton Security Ultra- PhotoDirector- PowerDirector- Alexa- \"Planet9 Link\"Some may find those items beneficial, I tend to prefer a clean slate and put on the things that I choose. There's also a couple of items like \"PredatorSense\" which launches from a dedicated button on the keyboard - it's Acer's software to control RGB lighting, fans, monitor temperatures, etc, and I find it useful.I've been very pleased with this as far as performance goes. It's very snappy. Gaming performance has been fantastic. The RTX 3060 graphics is great. I've been playing several modern games at ultra settings, and they seem to play quite well. I'm honestly pretty surprised... and liking this a lot more than I thought I would. I've got a top of the line desktop in the other room, but I just find it super comfortable to lay on the couch and play on a laptop with a gamepad. While playing graphics intensive games the fans haven't gotten too loud, unless I press the \"turbo\" button on the laptop to ramp them up all the way.I also quite like the low profile keys on the keyboard, and the backlight/rgb lights for them. You can adjust the brightness, and set 4 lighting zones in the included PredatorSense app.If I have anything critical to say, I guess the speakers don't get that loud. It's fine if that's the only noise in the room, but if you've got a loud A/C or fans or refrigerator or other ambient noise, it may not get loud enough with the built in speakers. Aside from that, I really haven't got anything bad to say at all.So in summary, the following things impressed me:- The above average unboxing experience- Comes with a halfway decent neoprene zippered sleeve- All metal casing- Size/weight - not as bulky as expected, fairly slim and light given what it is- Not an overwhelming amount of extra stuff installed- Fantastic gaming performance, graphics at ultra settings- Fans aren't that loud unless you turn on Turbo mode- Fantastic keyboard with backlit keys, customizable lighting via the PredatorSense appI feel like this bats above its price range and impressed me in several ways, so I am very happy to give a 5 star rating, and will be a repeat customer from Acer in the future based on my experience with this comparing to a Dell gaming laptop that I have had in the past.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

In the end it is a browsing device that does the trick quite well. If you need a computer for more power uses....this isnt it. But if you simply want a device that does more than a tablet, is snappy and lightweight? this is it. If you want it for college....it would depend on the major, for social sciences it is very useful, Other science or CS majors it would depend. As a bring to class note taker and video machine it is wonderful. The tablet mode is best served in the pedestal position.

Every time I open a new browser it tells me that I'm not connected to the internet. It gives me the sad dinosaur and I have to wait and refresh and then it sees I do have a connection and allows me to continue working. Then, if I'm on a page too long (3 mins) it gives me the disconnected story again. I thought this was due to the battery setting, protecting it from getting too low, but it even does it when I'm plugged in. Then, I figured it was my modem, but my husband uses an external usb WiFi network card and his works perfectly, he can even game using. So, I borrowed his card and sure enough, my internet works perfectly fine. Sad to say, the internet thing has been since day 1 and I just thought it was my crappy internet, otherwise I would have sent this $1500 laptop back!!Other than that, the laptop itself is pretty decent. It runs decently, start up and reboot are quick. The fingerprint login is super nice. The loud whine is detectable over microphone on laptop, which does cause some issues when doing group calls using the laptop mic and camera. The laptop camera is awful, the video is atrocious and makes you look orange and grainy, however, I don't really care what I look like, so it doesn't bother me that much.Every time you touch the laptop, you will leave marks.

However, I couldn't imagine a new apple computer having a worse camera than my old iPhone 6 which I am still happily using, so I took a chance! The laptop is awesome on so many levels! New M1 chip, super fast everything, and fantastic color display!The sound and yes, the camera, are phenomenal! I can only assume the bad camera reviews were made by video bloggers that need extreme HD resolution. I just do average work on my computer, so no problem there! I am thoroughly enjoying surfing online, streaming videos, and Zooming with great clarity. I needed to clarify this camera issue for those holding back from purchasing such a great computer just due to those negative camera opinions, as I was. If I had read my review or one similar to it, it would have eased my mind. So, unless you're a vlogger , fear not!It's a fantastic computer in every sense of the word! (Not to mention the $999 price for a new Mac!) Get it!!! You won't regret it!

My main dissatisfaction is that the Bluetooth headphones continuously disconnects when she switches from Zoom to Youtube or vice versa as well as when she is just on one or the other and not switching.

Return 1 (contains new requirements) or 0 (does not contain new requirements).\n", "input": "I purchased this base model Macbook Air M2 for attending online courses through a university. I've been mainly a Windows PC user for a while now. My last Macbook was an old 12-inch Macbook Pro G4 (remember those mini-me/Yow Ming commercials?).After being able to use this laptop for a couple of months, I've decided that given the current state of technology within my home, my future personal computers will most likely be all Apple, as long as I continue to use iPhones, AppleTVs and Apple Accessories (such as AirPods). The current form of the MacOS allows easy use of printers/scanners and any other computer peripheral you may need.With all that said, I will say that you should consider this base model for the following reasons:- You currently have an Apple ecosystem.- You need a lightweight, small form-factor laptop for basic computing needs.- You primarily run cloud-based platforms that don't require local storage.- You'd like to work \"unplugged\" for many hours without having to charge the laptop.- You enjoy a bright monitor and a pretty decent keyboard to type on.At the same time, I would NOT recommend this model if you need the following:- You'll be running large programs that require a lot of local storage.- You require a machine that will process/render high-resolution media. The lack of a fan will cause the Macbook to thermal throttle, lowering your performance. For a little more, you're better off going with the base model Macbook Pro.- Gaming (Thermal throttle will lower framerates).A few honorable mentions:- Despite the lack of larger, more visible speakers, the sound is decent for this category of laptop.- The low power requirements make this an easy travel laptop, not requiring that you bring a huge brick to keep this thing going.- The redesigned look is a lot nicer than the previous generation (I'm glad the wedge design is gone).Finally, regarding value:Considering where we are in tech today, I feel that for the money, we should no longer have base models with only 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD space. At the very least, I really hope that Apple would consider making their base models start at 16GB of Ram and 512GB of SSD storage without increasing the price. At the very least, if they keep the 256GB of SSD, give the option to keep an SD card on board without having to attach an external drive every time you want expanded storage.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Return 1 (contains new requirements) or 0 (does not contain new requirements).\n", "input": "Further Update 4-5-2021: At the current price of $748, I think you can do better than this. I spent about that much including an additional 16MB RAM, for a total of 24MB, and an additional 1TB SSD. But I'm happy I got it and if the price drops back down to around what I paid before the upgrades, $599, it still seems like a good deal.UPDATE 3-24-2021: I had to send my desktop unit in for repair about a month ago. That took about two weeks because it got stuck in transit when Texas got closed down by bad weather, and I had to use the laptop as my primary computer during that time. I connected it to my graphics monitor via the HDMI port, plugged a powered USB hub running four external hard drives, my graphics tablet and my webcam into one USB port, and used the other two USB ports for a card reader and wireless mouse. So, pretty much maxed out all the connectivity options including the ethernet port. Obviously I was not running all this off the battery.Other than time-wasting, I mostly use the computer for photo editing. The images are from a full-frame camera so the files are quite large to start and I often enlarge them. Editing uses a lot of memory and CPU/GPU juice. I had added 16GB of memory when I got the machine, which came in handy. As one would expect, the laptop didn't perform as well as the souped-up desktop does: everything took longer and it got frustrating at times. I wished I had added a larger SSD, which I've now done (another $100, bringing the total including the additional memory up to about $750). Ultimately, though, I got everything done that needed doing and I'm still impressed with the machine. It may be outdated already, I haven't looked, but I'm happy with the purchase and it definitely kept me sane while the desktop was gone, which my old laptop would not have done.This is a preliminary review of the Nitro 5 with the 9th Gen Intel Core i5-9300H and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650. I've had the machine for two weeks now. I paid $600 and dropped an additional $50 on a 16gb RAM stick, for a total of 24gb. I bought it because it was the least expensive unit I could find with a discrete GPU. I wanted something I can use for basic photo editing when I travel or when I feel like sitting in a cafe for a while, because I'm an optimist who believes both those things will be routine again some day. I'm not a gamer and can't speak to its capabilities for that.First the things I don't like:1) the keyboard. The keys are serviceable but a bit mushy. I prefer a more clicky keyboard but that's really a matter of taste and not function, and after two weeks I've adjusted to it. It's a good size, not cramped, and has a full-sized numerical pad. What I really don't like is that it's basically unusable in the daytime without the backlight turned up most of the way, and the backlight goes off when you pause typing for a few seconds, presumably to save battery. I don't understand that design decision. If you really want to save battery, make a keyboard that you can see without the backlight on. And the shift functions on the keys don't stand out that well even with the backlight. Maybe it's a gaming aesthetic thing, but I don't like it.2) The touchpad. It's just not very accurate. Moving between open tabs on a browser or trying to select tools in Photoshop or Lightroom and related plugins is a pain. I just use a mouse. I don't know what gamers use touchpads for but I can't imagine they'd like this one very well.3) Battery life. With the GPU idle, just using the unit for browsing, email and some writing, I got a bit more than five hours on a charge. When I started doing some moderately intensive photo editing involving the GPU, battery life dropped dramatically. If you're doing anything CPU/GPU intensive for any length of time you'll most likely want to keep it plugged in.4) Webcam. If I'm home I'm using my desktop webcam, and if I'm out I'm using my phone. The one on the unit is sort of a disaster. I guess that's where they're saving money. I would think anybody using the computer for Zoom or to stream would want to use an external USB one.5) Weight. This is a chonky fellow. I took it in my camera backpack on a shoot involving a lot of walking and noticed the extra couple pounds over the laptop it replaced. Not a big issue, though.6) Audio. The speakers are muddy and weak. You'll want to use headphones for music or gaming. It comes with Waves Maxx Audio, which I use on my desktop, but no amount of equalizing or enhancing is going to save these speakers. I expect nothing from laptop audio in this price range, and I got it.The keyboard backlight is the most aggravating of all those concerns for me. Classic example of form over function. Battery life is second, the touchpad third, and the webcam fourth. None of the issues come close to being deal breakers.Things I like:1) Performance. This is a $600 laptop with a decent four-core processor and a discrete GPU. Would I like an i7 or better and the RTX 2060? Sure. Do I want to pay another $500 or more for them? Why no: no I do not. It moved along pretty well right out of the box, and and with the inexpensive RAM upgrade it positively zips. Again, I can't speak to the gaming capabilities, but I'm really pleased with the performance for my needs. I'll have to add some storage at some point, as I expect many people will, but that's pretty inexpensive these days too.2) Construction: as the weight would indicate, this thing is solid. Despite the plastic body, nothing about it feels cheap. There's not much flex to the screen. The only thing I don't like about it is that the back is a solid piece that has to be completely removed to upgrade the RAM or the drives. It'd be nice if it had access panels for those. Prying it apart was anxiety-inducing. You should note there's an included SSD cable but it's not installed and it's tiny so put it somewhere safe and install it the first time you have the back off.3) The screen. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the brightness and accuracy. I did some work on a few pics that I then looked at on my graphics monitor, which cost more than this machine, and the colors were pretty much right on. I can't speak to it for gaming purposes, the frame/refresh rate is more or less irrelevant to me, but it's better than I expected for what I'm doing with it.4) Heat management. This is exceptional. The chassis is built to dissipate heat, and the two fans work really well, independently of one another, and quietly. Acer provides a heat management utility that allows the user to manually control the fans and to keep track of the processor temperatures. I've used the laptop as an actual laptop for up to two hours without appreciable discomfort.5) Bloatware. There's hardly any, and the Acer utilities are actually useful. I had to get rid of the preinstalled Norton Security and Microsoft Office trials but that's an easy job.6) Appearance. It's fine. It has the sort of angular, aggressive styling that seems to be de rigueur for gaming, and in this instance the styling incorporates the heat dissipation features so it's functional as well. I'd prefer something other than black but it's fine.7) Ports. It has an HDMI out, 2 USB 3.0, a USB-C, a USB 2.0, an ethernet port, an earphone jack and of course a power input. Pretty good collection. You can get by without Thunderbolt ports.tl;dr: As you would expect from a machine at this price point, Acer made some compromises. The camera and speakers are subpar, and the unit is mostly plastic. They also made some design decisions that are borderline incomprehensible to me, as with the keys not showing up well in good light without the backlight. The heat handling is great, the screen performance is better than I expected, it's fast and powerful, and I'm still surprised at getting even an entry-level GPU at this price. For a non-gamer using it as a photo editing and general purpose laptop, the value seems exceptional.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I returned it because the network adapter is terrible in my environment. After finding better options for the buck, I realize this computer is a poor investment for most people.Spending $400 for a computer with an I3 processor is not great. I know it is fast enough for most tasks.The network adapter here is only single band, 2.4 Ghz, 802.11bgn. This old, over-used standard is a foolish corner-cut by HP. Even $100 android tablets now include 5 GHZ, 802.11ac WIFI. With the older technology you are poorly equipped to fight for bandwidth in the increasingly congested WIFI environment. In my neighborhood I got single digit MHz downloads with the CF0014DX: OK for most web surfing, lousy for video streaming. With an 802.11ac adapter I get 150 MHz to 200 MHz downloads \u2013 an astonishing improvement.The good news if you already own a laptop with 2.4 Ghz WIFI is you can easily upgrade with a USB WIFI dongle costing less than $15. There are many options, I recently had success with this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LFXN1SJ/The CF0014DX computer only has two USB ports. Having to buy a WIFI dongle for a new computer and fill up a precious USB port is unacceptable.The other impractical aspect of this package is that the SSD is only 128 GB. It may seem passable for you today, but 256 GB is a realistic longer term minimum for most.I bought a better version of this computer for just $70 more: model HP 14-cf0051od with 256 GB SSD. Some listings show it having the older WIFI standard, but it certainly has an 802.11ac network adapter. The processor is noticeably much faster; it will seem fast for several years longer than the CF0014DX.I see the Lenovo IdeaPad 530S 14\u201d, similar in specs to my HP 14-cf0051od, on sale at big box for lower price. It has advantage over the two HPs of higher res graphics and ability to upgrade RAM. But no buyer\u2019s remorse here, I have long history with HP computers and am thrilled with my cf0051od.Buying a refurbished HP Elitebook or Dell Latitude on Amazon would also be a better value than the CF0014DX. I am a big fan of buying refurbished desktop computers (sans monitor) because they can be upgraded easily. I\u2019m shyer about refurbished laptops because they are more delicate; you can\u2019t just swap in new keyboard, mouse or monitor; many things can be wrong with them.

I.e. everything, LOL :DI was looking to build a mini-ITX desktop PC, and was targeting around 1500$ with monitor and peripherals. Then I suddenly came across the Ryzen chips and their shocking performance advantage w.r.t Intel mobile chips. This Legion 5 with a 45W Ryzen 7 4800H and an 80W 1660 Ti is an absolute beast of performance-per-watt metric.1) 4800H scores 4500 points in Cinebench R20 multi-thread. Just for reference, desktop Ryzen 7 3700X does 4800 Intel i7-10700K does 5300. For a mobile chip this is phenomenal.2) Lenovo did great job with cooling! Other laptops with 4800H have slightly lower score in sustained load. HP Omen and especially ASUS TUF laptop with their awful blocked air vents.3) 1660 Ti is full 80W, that means it is not restricted in performance. Moreover, it has a headroom for overclocking, I got +150 MHz on core, + 1000 MHz on memory with GPU max load temperature around 78 degC.4) The display is gorgeous. 144 Hz, 5 ms response time (with (!) Overdrive in Lenovo Vantage). It is just perplexing how this laptop in this price category includes such a jewel of a display.5) Keyboard is very nice too. I am comparing to Lenovo Ideapad 720S-15IKB laptop which has flat and shallow keys. Legion 5 in contrast has curved keys with much larger travel. Feels really great in long typing sessions.6) Upgrades, upgrades, upgrades. There are upgrades for: storage (NVMe + SSD or 2 x NVMe), RAM (up to 64 GB), Wi-Fi and even battery! This Legion 5 version has 60 Wh battery which allows to install secondary SSD. However you can order and install an 80 Wh battery which usually comes in Legion 7i. Secondary NVMe can be installed in any case, but it blocks the SSD upgrade.7) Ports! There are 4 x USB Type A, 1 x USB Type-C, HDMI and LAN. Such plenty of choice satisfies all laptop needs. Moreover, only 2 USB ports are on the sides, whereas everything else including charging port are on the rear side. It makes so much difference in cable management and access, such a great port placement decision!8) Finally, this laptop is more on the traditional side. It has webcam, it is on the top of the screen, numpad is present and has standard layout, Home/End/PgUp/PgDn buttons are primary and full-size, arrow keys are full-size in usual T-shape. Such a pleasure to use this laptop!9) Accessories. I purchased a TomToc laptop sleeve (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DLBJ4QD) which fits really nice! Also I got the Razer Gigantus V2 mouse pad Medium, which fits great in the sleeve.Thank you Lenovo!", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

The components are excellent - 16GB RAM @ 3200 MHz, 512GB NVMe SSD, 1660TI, Ryzen 4800H.2. The cooling solution is phenomenal. Giant air vents behind/below/left/right of the laptop blow out a ton of hot air. Even when the Ryzen 4800H was at max turbo speed playing XCOM 2, the CPU temperature barely exceeded 80C.3. The display is 144HZ, and its purdy. Bright screen, vibrant colors, and the gray-to-gray response time feels good too (no noticeable ghosting).4. I dig the blocky, low-key aesthetic. Nothing on this laptop screams \"edgy 12 year old,\" (besides the name \"Legion,\" which I guess is still better than having \"Predator\" or \"Republic of Gamers\" stamped on your laptop).5. It's heavier than a macbook air, but it doesn't feel unwieldy in your hands. And it go fast and cool.Learned a way to modify the registry editor to unlock a hidden power plan that prevents the Ryzen 4800H from ever going above its 2.9GHz base clock, and it's amazing. I'm hitting the same FPS on games because the GPU has more thermal headroom, and my CPU temp dropped from 80C to 60C.Haven't used this thing on battery yet, but from what I've heard it isn't great.

According to passmark, the 2070mobile inside perform better than average with machines that has the same card. The ram and NVMe that comes with it is good Samsung stuff as well.Cooling is effective. High fan speed only kicks in under high cpu load and it can cool cpu down quickly althrough cpu itself can reach 90s degree easily, but no throttling experienced so far.There is a \u2018cooler booster\u2019 fan mode which kick the fans in max speed to make it even cooler, but it could be very loud and I would concern the stress to the fans itself so won\u2019t be using the mode frequently.The weight itself is surprisingly not very heavy, but it still need to have its large power brick around to keep its maximum performance. Carrying it around for light tasks for 2 hours is still possible unless you accidentally use its GPU on the go.Overall, you are buying a Heavy duty performer for a pretty price.

Being familiar with Asus and their tablets I like the brand. I wanted a SSD and reading reviews here I liked that I could add another hard drive as the SSD standard is a M.2. So that leaves a big ol\u2019 slot for a 2.5 SSD (or HD.) Rather than use my old 250gb Samsung SSD because I wanted something new and shiny to go with my shiny new Asus I purchased a new Crucial 500gb 2.5 SSD and a Crucial 500gb M.2 SSD. Both on sale. Why not go all the way!Adding the 2.5\u201d was easy. The only thing is to get the back off remember the screws hidden under the rubber foot pads. (Rear ones only if I remember right, front didn\u2019t have any.) Next I used the software Crucial gives you Acronis to clone the stock M.2 to the new 2.5\u201d. Then I changed the boot order in the BIOS to the 2.5\u201d and swapped the M.2. Next I cloned the 2.5\u201d back to the M.2. Don\u2019t panic Acronis will say it has to restart and it will go into some safe mode looking thing while it clones. That\u2019s it. I prefer the OS to be on the M.2. Maybe that step isn\u2019t necessary? I figured the OS came on the M.2 so why not leave it there. To get windows to see either type \u201cpartition\u201d in search and click it. Go through those steps so you see the drive under PC.Very easy to add a HD or swap both. I went to a larger M.2 only because it was on sale. The ONLY thing I don\u2019t like about Crucial is BOTH were made in Mexico. Oh well. The one I replaced in the Asus was Chinese - even worse IMO. All this was very easy to do and if I can do it you can too. I would do a system image and create a restore USB thingy just in case. (Or Microsoft backup disks if you have an external DVD burner.)All in all a nice laptop though all in price wise it wasn\u2019t cheap, but cheaper than anything comparable and Asus gives you a lot of ability to upgrade which I like. It all feels high end though not Apple high end (even with upgrades no Apple high end price.) and is very lightweight. With the upgrades (and even before) I feel like it punches way above its weight class performance wise.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Another minor gripe is that there's no standby mode or off mode(from what I can find) for the Intel HD Graphics, so even though you're primarily using the 3080, the system still reserves half of your RAM for the APU, so even though this system is advertised as having 32gb of RAM, in actuality it's 16gb for general use and 16gb for the APU graphics memory.With the above being said, it's an overall great machine for the money, but if you have some extra cash to throw at it, I'd recommend going over to NewEgg and searching 'hi-devolution'.

I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Mac's as storage for information so this doesn't use storage much at all. Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. Also the battery for most of the work I am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max.

Obviously, at this price point, you are making tradeoffs between power and display, build quality and cost. The balance between these tradeoffs is pretty good. The Intel i5/Iris Xe graphics and 8GB of DDR4 RAM are not going to get you very far in AAA gaming, but with a Cinebench CPU multicore rating of 3673, you can absolutely play light PC games and will experience no delay with a few Chrome tabs or watching online streaming. The 15.6-inch FHD is 1920x1080 and gets pretty bright. With pretty minimal bezels, it is pleasant to use and peruse. The M.2 PCIe storage is quick and, at 256GB, you should be more than fine if you pair this with an external hard drive or a cloud service.Performance aside, you really see a bit of corner cutting on the keyboard and trackpad. The keyboard is tacky and has no backlight, so it really isn\u2019t a pleasant experience to use and I wouldn\u2019t suggest typing on it for any duration. The trackpad fairs a little better, but I have noticed that I do get some ghosting and have found that it fails to register clicks with an annoying regularity.

I loved the look and features, but I noticed it wouldn't go to sleep when the lid closed.This is a minor issue but I wasn't going to just \"deal with it.\" I paid almost $1k for this thing, and I needed it to freaking work right. Got the replacement ordered, and after a bit more troubleshooting I discovered that the spacebar was protruding just enough to be pressed when the lid closed.So in short, I couldn't have fixed it anyway due to it being a hardware issue. Anyways, I've gotten the replacement set up and I'm loving it.This thing is so light that it doesn't feel like it should have the components it contains (i7-1165G7 w/ Iris Xe IGPU).It runs Apex legends on medium to low settings with few hiccups, but be sure to put it on a flat surface to account for adequate cooling.Battery life is incredible due to the Intel Evo energy management system, I haven't stress-tested it yet, but I have a lot of confidence that it won't disappoint.When I say this thing is snappy, I mean incredibly fast, at almost any task. (hehe, rhymes) The 16GB of 4267MHz LPDDR4X RAM is a major contributor to that speed. The PCI Express NVME SSD feels like it's supercharged and overclocked; it's that fast. And the 1TB capacity gives me ample wiggle room for whatever files or games I might want to store on it.Camera is an underwhelming 720p pinhole lens, so nothing really to fawn over there.The fingerprint sensor is super helpful as well. You can use it to sign in to websites as well as the laptop itself.Overall, very happy with the laptop so far, but I was disappointed that the first one I got was faulty. Points docked, Acer. I would definitely recommend this to someone who needs a powerful laptop that doesn't take up much space.As an added bonus, it has a pretty snazzy color scheme as well. The subtle green with the bronze/gold accents really goes well together in my opinion. The only downside is that these colors are the only ones available.Hope to use it for years to come!", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I don't feel like it's going to fall apart on me.CONS: The CPU runs HOT. And while this is to be expected when processing a high-graphics, high-input game, the fans are NOISY. The chassis grows hot in the upper margins above the top row of keys (I suspect this is where the CPU is housed), and if you want to keep it cooler, you have to crank the fans waaaay up. The GPU is fine. This pertains only to the CPU. This feeds into the next complaint: The audio for this machine truly sucks. The speakers are located on the bottom of the machine, so with the fan noise and the speaker location all the audio is either inaudible or very muddy. I had to lift the laptop up to make out what someone was saying in a Youtube vid--and the speakers were on high. This is purportedly a gaming laptop, and games have soundtracks that people want to hear. This just feels like they tried to cut corners. Lastly, I had to disable the camera driver. It would switch the camera on and off randomly and in quick succession whenever I'd start up a game.So ... yeah. If you want it for high-end gaming, maybe find a different machine that won't bring you annoyances. If you are playing videos, or listening to music only, or using it for writing, etc, you'll be fine.Five stars for the screen. Three stars for the gaming due to the sound issues, and lack of sluggish cooling for the CPU. I only use it plugged in, so I can't attest to the battery life ... hence four stars.The picture is an example of how high the resolution is in a gaming environment.

When I first received my package I opened the huge Amazon box and found the smaller laptop box inside. I was surprised because it looked like it would have been sliding around a lot. I opened it up and everything appeared to be okay. I spent the next couple hours performing windows updates and browsing the internet. The track pad isn't great which is okay because I normally use a mouse but it's just average at best and seems to stick a bit. Really the track pad doesn't bother me but my left speaker makes a horrible fuzzy sound! I am worried that it was damaged during transport or I got a lemon because I hear people talking about how crisp the speakers are and how good they sound. My speaker makes a vibrating/fuzzy sound no matter what volume level but when it's louder the buzzing is a lot worse. I'm going to show my girlfriend and see if she notices but if she does that's a deal breaker and I'll have to send it back to exchange for another. I'll update this in a few days.UPDATE: Amazon sent me a replacement unit and the first one did indeed have something wrong with the speaker because the new one is very clear, crisp and loud. I am having some slight issues with my second one as well though. I have 300 Mbps internet but I seem to often be getting only 15Mbps down but 90+ up. Some very small files were extremely slow to download. For now I'm sending the dud back to Amazon and I'll continue to test this one. I'll update again once I use the replacement for a day or 2 maybe my internet was just acting up.Update 2: Down to 1 Star I'm starting to lose hope and just think this computer is a piece garbage for $1000. My internet speeds are terrible. I have 300 Mbps internet and I'm getting very inconsistent speeds with this laptop. My girlfriends 6 year old Mac gets around 200Mpbs down and 100Mbps up and my Galaxy S7 gets about 250Mbps down and 90+ Mbps up. Meanwhile his laptop gets around 25 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up. I've tested the internet on multiple speed test sites and they all return the same results. I am extremely disappointed overall with this laptop.

No me quejo de nada; lo uso tambi\u00e9n para la universidad y no se traba en nada.Te recomiendo comprarte mas almacenamiento si lo utilizas para jugar muchos juegos.Por lo general, es buen producto.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I don't do that much on this machine, social media, write, Sims 4, that's about it so it does what I need it to do and it does it well. I got this machine for under 1000 on sale. The one and only gripe I have with it is the really LOUSY battery life....if I'm playing my Sims 4 game? From 100% charged, it'll last MAYBE 45 minutes. I refuse to lower the game's specs for any reason. If I'm just noodling around online, it'll last 2-3 hours. I had an ASUS laptop back in 2009 and I've since put Linux on it and that battery lasts a bit longer than this one!

Also the matte finish is easily scrached, at the charging port you will very soon get some scratching from pluging it in, as under the laptop if you place it at some edge there the rubber feet dont touch, I foresaw this and added a Dbrand skin on it.

Now to the negatives: I have read that the OS excessively uses virtual memory to speed up the system. After doing some initial tests I can confirm that this is true. What does this mean? this means that the Internal SSD might not last as long as it should because of the excessive write and read to the Solid state drive.

Below is my experience and this is VERY IMPORTANT for anyone buying this in US and travelling to a country where this model isn't sold:- Heating issue from start. It gets usually so hot that you have no other choice than to use an external keyboard- Loud fan noise- Sometime just wont open simple applications like outlook etc and you need to restartAfter 5 months around, the display just went off(black screen). HP India didn't do anything saying this model isn't sold in India(smaller screen model is sold here). So this laptop has now become a piece of junk.

The performance is definitely on the side of mid-range. This laptop is. VERY fast. It boots up in seconds and opens programs with ease. I got the 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD model, and even with just 4GB of RAM the laptop runs super fast. The wifi is amazing too! The speeds you get are amazing for a wifi connection.This is a thin form factor laptop. It is a 15.6\" screen, and it has a keyboard with a numeric keypad to make entering long strings of numbers easy. Even though the form factor is thin, you still get an ethernet port, 3 USB ports, a USB-C port, a full sized HDMI port, and a headphone/speaker combo port.The laptop has a cool feature where when you open it, the hinge elevates the keypad for better ergonomics when typing. The speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop. The laptop comes with Windows 10 Home in S mode (which you can get a one time upgrade out of if you like). S mode is a locked down version of Windows that only allows signed apps and apps from the App Store to run.The keyboard is great to type on. The keys are crisp and responsive, and I love the fact that it has a numeric keypad (albeit at a reduced size). The touchpad is pretty responsive too. I find that Windows laptops usually have issues with their touchpads as far as ease of use go, but this touchpad works fine. I wish it were a tad bit bigger, but that is my preference.I would recommend you go for more RAM and more SSD space than I got, but even the lower RAM and HDD model works wonderfully. This is a good laptop from a name brand and I would recommend that anyone go for this if you want a great streaming and productivity laptop.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

If I ever feel that it needs a little more power/speed I will add another 4 or 8 but so far it is perfect.The 128GB SSD is more than enough for what I need and this was one of the key factors that made me buy this computer. Cheaper ones come with eMMC storage which is slower and normally only 32GB or 64GBIt does not have backlit keyboard, I wish it did but it is not a deal breaker and I already knew it didn't have it before placing my order.It takes about 45 seconds to boot (a little bit on the slow side) but once its loaded it runs pretty smoothlyIt came with Windows 11 S More which won't allow you to install anything except from the Microsoft store (I think that's what's called), but getting out of S mode is SUPER EASY, takes less than 1 minute. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern). I also like the fact that is a name brand and is not a chrome book!I don't give it 5 stars because it would've been nice to get it with 8GB and a backlit keyboard.

It finally wore out, I liked it so bought this one as a replacement. Though it is fine there are a few unadvertised changes that irk me. First, this one does not open nearly as much as the UX31A. The UX31A would open almost 150 degrees, this one only to about 130 degrees. I have already run into operating situations where this I miss the old spec. For instance if the laptop is on a kitchen counter and you are standing to use it -- you really want that extra opening angle. Second, the UX31A power supply was made so the two prongs would fold back into the body of the power cube. This was great when you threw it into your carry case so the prongs would not poke into anything. Not so with this new one. They stick out and that's it. The UX31A came with a slip case. Not this one. Finally the speakers on the UX31A were on a bar in front of the function keys. On this one they come out the bottom of the case. Sound can be muffled. In my mind 3 poor design decisions and one just cheap cost saving measure. Now I am disappointed.

The battery will last a while for normal tasks but don\u2019t expect it to last more than an hour (most likely less than 40 minutes) while playing games requiring the graphics card.Pros: The list is too long of the pros for this laptop, but the primaries are the RTX2070, 10th gen Intel i7, and NVMe SSD. This combination provides for running most games currently available at maximum settings and still get a respectable 50-60 FPS.Cons: Crapware. This is actually the only reason I removed a star from the rating. I would gladly pay extra, and have, to not be forced to remove lots of, what I consider to be, useless software. By far the worst offender on the list of crapware preinstalled is Norton. This software has absolutely no place on a gaming laptop because it uses far more resources than it should for the benefit it provides. As a professional IT person, I recommend and use Eset for computer security.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

My previous Acer was excellent, needing only a HDD in almost 8 years of hard daily business use. In my search for a replacement laptop, I specifically wanted a discrete graphics card instead of the built in Intel Graphics. My laptop is plugged in 99.9% of the time so I have no idea of battery life. I'm not a big gamer, just occasionally. Based on mostly Rave reviews online and you tube, and my previous Acer experience, I was excited to find the Nitro 5 for an excellent price. I was concerned about the small ssd drive of 256 gb as I do a lot of graphics work. I added a 256gb thumb drive to the USB 3 port for just over $30 on Amazon, now I have a more acceptable 512GB storage. I have 2 areas that could be improved. First is it takes several steps to activate the Geforce GTX 1650 video card in the Windows settings as it is disabled on arrival. Also, the volume of MAXX sound thru the built in speakers is weak. I definitely recommend this to others. I also advise purchasers to check the specs of this laptop on Amazon as there are multiple listings of Nitro 5 with previous years cpu's.

Since it's my first I do not have much to compare it to, but mostly everything satisfies me.Good:It runs very quick with today's modern games. From GTA V to Cities Skylines, I have no complains to how it runs. The bootup is also good, only takes a couple of seconds. Screen is ok too with displaying colors, again, nothing to complain about. The best part is the service. The first laptop that arrived was defective. The screen was fuzzy upon startup so I needed to return it. After contacting Amazon they had me return it. The problem was that meant I was out of a laptop for a few days. However, they allowed me to purchase another laptop and wait for that one to arrive before I returned the other one.Bad:It's very loud, especially when you play high demanding games. This is good since the computer won't fry, but headphones are almost a must. The battery life isn't all that good even when I'm not running games, maybe a couple hours tops. It smudges easily by fingerprints all around also. It is kind of heavy and thick, which may serve as a problem for those wanting to fit in a lot of cases.Verdictit is a great choice for someone who needs a portable laptop that wants to play games for a low price.

The built in speaker volume needs to be turned up pretty high to hear over the fan noise. The fan noise also means you should leave your mic on push to talk rather than open during online games, otherwise your poor teammates will have to listen to it constantly. Good news is there is blue tooth, so I suggest connecting external speakers or headphones instead.-hot CPU. Make sure your battery settings are on \"better performance\" rather than \"best performance\", regardless of if it's plugged in or not. Otherwise, the CPU hits 90 C. Better to have less performance or learn to undervolt if you want the laptop to last very long.-wrong GPU used during gaming. If you have really bad performance, it could be that the laptop is using the Intel GPU rather than the GTX 1650. Go into NVIDIA Control Panel, and under \"manage 3D settings\" and \"global settings\", switch preferred graphics processor to \"high-performance NVIDIA processor\" rather than auto.-laptop suddenly restarts within seconds of booting up, when not plugged into power. For me, going into startup apps and turning off \"Delayed Launcher\" fixed this.-not enough space, and plenty of bloatware to make it worse. Definitely invest in at least 1TB of additional storage. 256 GB is only enough space for two or three games, unless you only play games from the 90's.Cons (without solutions I could find):-yellowish smudges at the top of the screen, only visible though when the screen is black-the touch pad is terrible. It's on the left for some reason, so both your hands have to be crammed left to use them during games. Not an issue if you use controllers or a mouse. Also, the mouse is very delayed and floats around. Tried updating drivers but nothing works, it's super laggy most of the time!-keyboard lights only turn on when a key is pressed and automatically turn off after 30 seconds. There is no way to leave them on, which sucks when you're using it in the dark. There are forums complaining about this, and the company refuses to add the feature to leave them on even though many people are requesting the option.-short battery life.

This is a review for a Dell XPS 13 9360, but it appears to be the same form factor as the 9370 and 9380)I have owned 2 XPS15 and 2 XPS13 laptops in the past. The build quality on this one falls far short of prior models. They keys are klunky and feels like they can pop off any moment and the touch pad is rubbery instead of smooth. The edges are also sharper and has a rougher finish than older models. Dell has done a terrible job of managing expectations by significantly lowering build quality. There's no HDMI or DP output like in previous models, so you need another $100 dongle for video out, or an additional USB port. The edges are sharp instead of round like on previous models.After 10 months of use, I can add: The touchpad has become smooth, and I've almost gotten used to the flimsy keys. The battery life and Wi-Fi on this laptop is its only saving grace. 8GB of RAM that can't be upgraded, is a deal breaker for anyone who needs more 3 or so tabs open in a browser.

Many other reviews complain of sound which is very quiet but the laptop has bluetooth so I was able to just Bluetooth a speaker to it to solve that issue. I have no issue with the screen like many others have so either I\u2019m not picky or I got lucky to get a good screen. This laptop does come with a 1 year manufacturer warranty. Which I am currently in the process of using to have a faulty hinge replaced. 8gb of ram is more than enough for my online college classes but there is also space to expand this if you need to. I\u2019m also able to run sims 4, wizard 101, and other more minor games with no issue. It can run games like fortnite but it only runs on the lowest graphics setting and gets hot fast so if you are looking to do more online popular games I would suggest a different laptop with better specs all around. I did only get the 128gb of space but to fix this I bought an external SSD with a 500gb capacity. They have different sizes which is something you should look into before buying so you know what to expect for more space. All in all it\u2019s a perfect laptop for me. The battery life is fine for most of my school work I can normally run it from full for 1-2 hours depending on if I\u2019m doing work or gaming. I would recommend this laptop for anyone who just needs a basic laptop for everyday use that isn\u2019t gaming.

Return 1 (contains new requirements) or 0 (does not contain new requirements).\n", "input": "The ASUS Zenbook ux330ua(8th gen) is an excellent value. As a CS graduate student, I needed something that could handle a heavy coding workload while still being portable enough to bring to class and not break the bank. This fit the bill perfectly, and I highly recommend it to students or anyone who wants a premium ultrabook experience at a budget-friendly price.Display 5/5:This is one the best displays you will find on a device under $1000. 100% sRGB coverage is a must have for me. As someone who does a moderate amount of graphics coding and web design, I need to know the colors on my screen are accurate. For those who don't use this device for content creation, you will still enjoy the vivid colors, respectable black levels, and sharp 1080p resolution. The matte display also prevents distracting reflections. Note: There was no noticable backlight bleeding on my unit. It's there if you look for it, but you would be hard pressed to notice it in any real use case scenario. This is not a fault of ASUS as this is typical for IPS displays in general. I also did not have any dead pixels.Keyboard 4/5:The keyboard is respectable if not remarkable. The keys have good travel but are slightly mushy. My unit will sometimes fail to detect when keys are pressed near their corners. The layout is fine, and the half height arrow keys are surprisingly very usable. This keyboard will not remind you of a ThinkPad, but it will get the job done and has held up well to my coding sessions.Audio 5/5:The audio is excellent for a an ultrabook in this price range. It probably won't fill a large conference room, but the built-in speakers are perfect for online lecture videos or the occasional Amazon Prime video.Build Quality 4/5:This device can't quite hold up to the industry leaders like the Surface Laptop, MacBook, ThinkPad, or XPS products. However, those devices are in other price category entirely. At the current price, it certainly outshines the competition, namely the Acer Swift. The chassis is lightweight, and the spun aluminum finish is a beautiful touch. There is a small amount of flex around the keyboard and screen areas. However, I wouldn't consider it to be durability concern.Battery Life 5/5:The battery life was a major selling pont for me. I am getting 8-10 hours depending on usage. As a student on the go, being able to work all day on one charge is a game changer and should be industry standard by now.Performance 5/5:The quad core Intel i5 8250u processor has excellent performance and represents a huge jump from the previous generation's dual core. Pairing this CPU with 8GB of ram and a 256GB SSD, this device will remain a solid performer for years to come. I can easily run a Linux VM to do any work I can't do on Windows. and the performance is superb. The graphics processor is an integrated Intel UHD 620. While this won't be suitable for any heavy gaming, it is perfectly suited for light graphics work, video watching, and displaying to external monitors. You can even play some older or less demanding video games at respectable settings(CounterStrike: GO, Half-Life 2, etc.).Overall 5/5:This is an excellent ultrabook for those on a budget. If you are still reading at this point, there is a good chance you should go ahead and buy this product. You won't be disappointed. For those with a bit more wiggle room in their budget, take a look at the Zenbook ux410 and ux430. Those devices manage to fit a 14\" screen in the same chassis by using smaller bezels around the display.Additional Comments:This device is highly compatable with Linux. I have had no issues with any distro I have tried. I can confirm it works flawlessly with Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, and with elementaryOS 0.4.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

A chromebook appealed to me because a lot of the work I do is linked through Google. I spent a decent amount of time researching, and I am sorry to say that I pegged this one wrong.For starters the battery life is absolutely atrocious. I gave it a full charge right out of the box without ever turning it on, just like it says in the manual, and used it maybe twice. The big issue wasn't the amount of battery life while using it per say, but I learned that when you power it off, it doesn't truly shut off. It concerned me at first when I noticed that it turns on right away every single time you open the lid. It doesn't power off, it hibernates. So you are draining battery life even when it is sitting on your shelf \"powered off\".If that wasn't bad enough, even if you change it in the power settings to not sleep when the lid is closed, you cannot control when the screen shuts off. If the screen shuts off, yes, you guessed it, it hibernates again.... Really terrible if you are, I don't know, say, in the middle of uploading some pictures from an SD card, and are not constantly hovering around the device to keep hitting a key or moving the track pad to keep the screen on.On that note, the device is really really really slow. I am a huge fan of samsung products, but this one is just terrible. My Galaxy S7 is faster than this thing is. That's pretty despicable.In terms of the physical device itself. I should have thought to get a backlit keyboard. O boy was that dumb of me. And speaking of keyboards, it looks like they crammed in as much as they could into such a small space and went: \"What do you think people will use the most?\" and then cut those keys. Besides your basic ASDF and 1-9 keys there is nothing else really on the keyboard. And the Caps Lock is replaced by a search key. Don't think I needed it, but then again, I didn't do as good of a job researching this time around.Do yourself a favor and spend slightly more money for something good.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Or if I open an Excel Sheet and open the Firefox browser and it stays frozen, it gets too hot and it stops working. I'm getting blue screens when it freezes and gets very hot. These blue screen I'm getting daily! This is not OK!!! It is worth mentioning that from day 1 I left connected to the internet, updating windows, updating the antivirus, check the drivers with the Asus tool to see if there was a new one, and only got a new driver for the WIFI card and audio. It is worth mentioning that I am a medium / advanced user in computers, work in technology and this is not normal in a new laptop, just removed from the box. I wrote this comment from my old laptop because it is impossible to work with the Asus UX331UA. What a disappointment!!!! Note, I attach some blue screenshots and I can mention that I have placed an open source tool to measure the temperature and recently turned on sample between 42 \u00b0 - 45 \u00b0, when I open 1 or 2 applications, such as Firefox or Chrome browser (Only 1 of them) And Excel or Photos or Zimbra Mail the temperature is triggered at 75 \u00b0 - 78 \u00b0. I tried to place a Fan Cooler tray and really the difference of temperature peaks go down 1 \u00b0 or 2 \u00b0. I have also tried the Quiet Fan tool that comes by default and I have left it in \"Disabled\" mode because in this way, I hear the fancooler of the computer working at full power, but even so, while working (40 miuntos - 1 hour) reheats and freezes for a few minutes and crash - blue screen.

Previously I had only ever used Toshiba laptops with 4-6 GB of RAM and not great graphics cards. I finally decided to upgrade because I needed something more powerful to run Adobe Lightroom without crippling lag and freezing screens. The bonus ability to use VR is also a perk I wasn't going to turn down either. I can't really rate the \"Value for Money\" since I have not previously spent this kind of money on a laptop, and it was a Black Friday deal so who knows exactly what the mark down was, but for ~$2000 including a square trade 4 year protection plan I would make the purchase again.So far the MSI Leopard has been amazing. I was surprised and impressed with the size, weight and build. The keyboard is solid, no give or flexibility to the keys, and I get to pick the colors for the LED's! The screen has strong hinges and the power chord is a monster. The only thing I wish was different was the location of the FN key. It's way over by the left CTRL while the volume and brightness keys are overlayed on the arrow keys so my average sized hand isn't long enough to reach FN and the adjustment keys.*Update* after just under 2 years the case is being held together with duct tape, epoxy, binder clips and thin wood braces because of various cracks in the bottom and sides of the laptop. The laptop managed to go a year and a half with no physical damage but the past 4 months more and more cracks have been appearing despite attempts to reinforce weak areas. More recently the plastic by the right hinge snapped and flew everywhere, now whenever the screen is lifted up or put down I hear a peeling sound and am trying to find a way to hold the screen frame together without getting it stuck open or closed. The laptop has been used almost daily but has never been dropped or handled roughly, I can only surmise the damage is due to the laptop running hot. Rather disappointed that my 8 year old Toshiba managed to outlast my (almost) 2 year old MSI in structural integrity.

You can feel very little warm above the keyboard area when watching live stream or gaming in auto mode and the fan noise is low, I would say the thermal is good. Battery life is about 4 hours when watching live stream.Pros:1. Nice build quality and clean look.2. Has a num pad.3. Screen is decent.4. RAM & SSD are easily upgradable + secondary SSD slot is available.5. Fast CPU, decent thermal, and low fan noise.6. Power & most of I/O ports are at the back, and there is one USB port at both sides.Cons:1. Need some time to get used to the keyboard. I kept hitting the num pad when trying to hit the back space.2.

I also ran Mount and Blade\" Bannerlord II, and that game does not even begin to test this beast until you get into larger sieges, but butter smooth in turbo.

I want to start this review off by saying that I'm an educator and have been using my Acer Chromebook for over 5 years and it still works great. The Chromebooks my school uses (not Samsung) also have very few problems. I bought this Samsung 3 Chromebook on Black Friday from a big box store with the plans to pass my older machine off to my teenager. The first thing I noticed was that the sound quality is horrible on this compared to my five year old Acer. One night I was watching Amazon Prime movies and the battery was getting low so I plugged my Samsung Chromebook 3 in to the charger it came with and went to bed. In the morning I wanted to finish my movie and when I turned it back on the screen was messed up. I contacted Samsung and described the screen as being blotchy. They told me there was a 1 year warranty and to send it in. I did and a week later I got a message saying that the LCD screen was broken and it violated the warranty. I questioned how I broke it given it was working 100% fine, I plugged it in and set it on a desk to charge, and nobody touched it besides myself (charging in my room). They said they'd fix it for $168 which is more than I paid for it. I declined and it was sent back. I just ordered a generic LCD screen from Amazon and fixed it myself in under 5 minutes. The generic screen was $32. I am completely disgusted with Samsung. This is the fourth product from Samsung that I have had issues with ($3600 designer fridge, $1500 laundry pair, and also a microwave$350 microwave). I've had extended protection warranties on all my other Samsung purchases, but due to the nature of having to buy quick for Black Friday (sells out in seconds) I didn't get an extra warranty. I will never buy Samsung anything again. I definitely would not buy this again.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

For a gamer, the laptop is quiet and capable. Although there have been some reports of screen issues, I believe those may have been an inconsistency with the first batches, and the issues have been worked out by now.But let's review some caveats. This model (82B1000AUS) comes with HDMI 2.0 (not 2.1 which is a bit of a let down) and USB-C with Display Port 1.2 capabilities. Which one is a better option? Honestly, there is virtually no difference, unless you include HDMI 2.1 which brings noticeable benefits.[Hdmi 2.0]Supports resolutions up to 3840x2160 (4K UHD) with a 60Hz refresh rate, or 60 frames per second.18Gbps bandwidth.[Hdmi 2.1]Supports 3840x2160 (4K UHD) with a refresh rate of 120Hz, or 120 frames per second.Supports 7680x4320 (8K) with a 60Hz refresh rate, or 60 frames per second.The standard in PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.48Gbps bandwidth.[DisplayPort 1.2]Supports resolutions up to 3840x2160 (4K UHD) with a 60Hz refresh rate, or 60 frames per second.17.28Gbps bandwidth.[DisplayPort 2.0]Supports resolutions higher than 7680x4320 (8K) and 8K with a refresh rate of 120Hz, or 120 frames per second.80Gbps bandwidth.A laptop that has HDMI 2.1 or DP 1.4+ would cost you much more. And, to be quite honest, if you are really serious about gaming, a laptop will never beat a desktop in regards to performance, features, biodegradability, thermals, etc...

I was impressed with the price that I locked in it at, unfortunate for anyone buy after I did as the price immediately increased minutes after I purchased.Already knowing that the stated 8gb wouldn't be enough i immediately ordered a ram upgrade to install after a startup check. Additionally I knew that a HD upgrade was probably in order, so a 1t firecuda was ordered as well.The purchase was seamless.. the shipping was quick. I appreciate the great service provided by the seller.As for the nitro... straight out of the box it was quick to start (updates excruciating like always) and the display was amazing. Games ran ok at mid level settings, streaming at 1080 was good (once loaded it would look incredible).On to the upgrades... after an hour I had the laptop taken apart, stuffed full of new part and ready to start.With the maxed out 32gb of ram startup was missed because i blinked. I discovered 2 to 3 more rounds of updates which took less than 5 mins including restart. I decided to try and stream some 4 k vids and they ran flawlessly and looked beautiful. I tried out some games at max settings and they were just jaw dropping.Long story short... if you are looking for a great laptop at a good price this is it! Watch the price as it fluctuates. Also be prepared for some upgrades... the SSD included is not sufficient for gaming and the ram could probably use to be at least 16gb. Don't worry they designed this laptop with that in mind with 2 SSD bays and 1 HHD bay and room for 32gb of ram.I am happy with my purchase as I knew what I was getting and was prepared to put the extra into it. 32 gb may have been overkill but im elated with the results!

The fingerprint reader worked for me every time. The problem with my system is it started making a very high pitched squeaking noise under the keyboard randomly.

This is the way to go. Never get a computer with a hard drive again. Forget 1 T hard drives; pointless in these days of cloud storage and USB sticks with 128 Gb of storage costing under $20.Haven't used the camera yet, and since I connect the laptop to a huge monitor and have wireless trackball and keyboard, don't use the fingerprint reader much, use a pin instead. But when I travel, the fingerprint reader worked just fine.Again, it may be common, but pleasantly surprised at the size and weight of the 'brick.' Which is the term for the transformer, and they used to weigh 4-5 lbs all by themselves. This brand should be bragging about that, because it's slightly larger than an iPhone transformer. When you travel, it's the weight of the whole setup, not just the computer, that matters. Computers without hard drives are lighter, boot in about 6 seconds, load Word or Excel in 5 seconds, not 20 seconds or more like hard drive computers.Because I love my trackball so much, I bring it along when I travel, so don't use the mousepad. In fact, if you type on the computer's keyboard, occasionally your wrist or a finger brushes the mousepad, making it do funny things like move the location of typing.I can travel through the control panel to turn off the mousepad, but strangely that setting doesn't stick. The next time I turn on the computer, mousepad is live again. When I turn on the computer I leave it on all day, so we're talking taking 30 seconds once a day to turn it off when I'm working in a hotel or on the couch, but it would be a tiny bit nicer if one of the F keys turned the mousepad on and off while leaving trackball or mouse live.That, however, is not a flaw of this computer, but of the whole laptop industry, which has standardized what F keys do.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Prop the back up 1 inch and invest in a computer fan but make sure its compatible.--Still a relevant GPU and the CPU is overkill. The same CPU is being used for all the new generations.--I highly recommend throttling the CPU to -0.140 for desktop work and disabling the GPU. For gaming the PC will crash if the CPU is throttled below -0.135.--It does run hot but if you treat this laptop right. Regularly dissemble for dust cleaning and repasting the thermal paste the computer will last.The only issues i've had is with GEFORCE freezing on driver updates and not allowing it to ever continue. This issue was short lived.I went through two spells of blue screening during gaming which I relate to the game driver. A simple factory reset fixed this issue.Note to consider- Many gaming laptop companies have horrendous and absolutely useless customer service. They will charge you an arm and a leg for repairs. ACER is one of these companies but their products are fairly good for the price. If your screen or components ever fail you'll be paying $500+ for repairs so don't break it--The CPU bottlenecks the GPU which is a good thing--Do not buy a less powerful GPU for a laptop than a 1660ti. Any less powerful and you'll be replacing it in just a couple years spending $2,000 on two lower end gaming laptops because the GPU became obsolete instead of $1200 now. Avoid the 1650 gpu.--Make sure this particular model does NOT come with the MAX-Q 1660ti.

I had never heard of Dynabook before and learned that it's what use to be the Toshiba brand, so it got me interested. However it seemed they were a bit heavy and bulky for not being a gaming system and being designed for business and work. Usually users want slim and light weight now for portability, and the thicker systems are typically seen more in gaming laptops.Fast forward to today and this new version of the Dynabook Satellite Pro. It's slimmer, sleeker and a good bit lighter in weight. It does come with ?integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics which can handle non-graphic intense online multiplayer games. But trying to play anything with very high graphics would likely have some issues. Also I'd suggest using a laptop cooler (fan) if you do plan to play games on this system, since the slim design is better suited for portability rather than ventilation, and laptops tend to to heat up when the graphics card is running at full power.The keyboard is comfortable and I'm able to type on it with ease. I don't feel cramped and I don't accidentally hit the wrong keys like I tend to with my smaller 13 inch laptop. The anti-glare screen in nice for days when I want to work out on the deck so I'm not struggling to sit at the just right angle to see. It's bright and the colors are rich, the images sharp.The system starts up quickly and software launches and runs smoothly. I've installed a few programs that I use for work and they run into no issues at all. The computer is a good balance of being large enough to work on for hours without feeling cramped, but also slim enough to be portable and easy to carry in a bag. I log in for meetings on this, take calls and am able to do everything for both work and personal use on it. Overall I'm very pleased with this Dynabook. It's been a great computer for both working from home and for doing every day personal computer work on.

No computer I've owned has had a problem like that so soon. Overall I've been disappointed with this computer. It uses more power than most laptops. I travel and live off-grid most of the time. I attempted to get a 12v charge cord so i wouldn't need to run it through my inverter but wasn't able to find one. So that was my first disappointment.It didn't have the hard drive storage I thought it was going to have. I do digital art, photography and videos so this was my second disappointment. I looked at so many laptops before I bought I guess I just didn't remember which one had what features. I also was limited to laptops where I could make monthly payments.I probably shouldn't have asked my grandson who's a gamer for advice in selecting the right computer for me.

If you plan on doing heavy processing in class the cooling system will be disruptive, but for my applications I appreciate the adequate cooling.I'm a software developer and find the laptop overall great with the smooth text rendering and comfortable keyboard. I also greatly enjoy my audio experience and was surprised by the very well driven headphone out that I normally use an external DAC and amplifier for.I ended up removing all of the bundled software which caused a very noticeable performance drop on the system and some minor annoyances (dragon center autopinning namely).Overall I would definitely recommend this system to others.

La laptop por fuera a pesar de ser contruida en pl\u00e1stico tiene un excelente acabado y se rigidez, al encenderla est\u00e1 el teclado con iluminaci\u00f3n RGB de una sola zona (por lo que los efectos ser\u00e1n limitados) con un muy buen brillo adem\u00e1s de un excelente recorrido de pulsaci\u00f3n, tacto e inclusive un ligero pero agradable sonido. Acompa\u00f1ando est\u00e1 el Trackpad con excelente respuesta, tama\u00f1o, compatibilidad total con los gestos de Windows e incluso botones suaves y de tacto muy agradable.Por parte de la pantalla FHD de 15,6\ufffd?con tecnolog\u00eda IPS y frecuencia de 144hz, cubre un gama de colores m\u00e1s que buena aunque no perfecta y esto puede ser algo negativo para dise\u00f1adores gr\u00e1ficos o artistas digitales, sin embargo para jugar, consumo multimedia y hasta tareas art\u00edsticas no tan profesionales o estudiantes como mi caso es m\u00e1s que perfecta y hace incre\u00edble la experiencia en este equipo. En cuanto a los 144 hz , la fluidez es notoria en todos lados especialmente porque cuenta con Adaptive Sync (de 48 a 144hz seg\u00fan Radeon Software) que sincroniza los \u201cfps\ufffd?que d\u00e9 le equipo con los \u201chz\ufffd?que representa para hacer el uso a\u00fan m\u00e1s fluido pero se nota un tiempo de respuesta alto que produce \u201cghosting\ufffd?a la hora de jugar, para usuarios sensibles a esto, sin embargo personalmente no es ning\u00fan problema, pero el brillo es algo bajo y en exteriores dificulta que sea usada adecuadamente a pesar de tener una acabado mate antireflectante. En conclusi\u00f3n es una excelente pantalla con las \u00faltimas tecnolog\u00edas que a pesar de no ser perfecta es mucho mejor que lo que se suele encontrar en este rango de precios y no puede considerarse como un de los puntos d\u00e9bil de esta laptop.Entre los a\u00f1adidos tenemos unas excelentes bocinas muy por encima del promedio de port\u00e1tiles especialmente de este tipo pues adem\u00e1s de un volume muy alto tienen buena presencia de graves, tambi\u00e9n una excelente cantidad de puertos, a pesar de que falta un lector de tajetas SD todos los puertos USB cumplen con excelentes velocidades de transferencia al igual que la entrada Ethernet y finalmente el USB-C tambi\u00e9n es una entrada DisplayPort permitiendo tener hasta 2 monitores externos, la c\u00e1mara 720p a 30 cuadros funciona excelentemente bajo condiciones de buena iluminaci\u00f3n y est\u00e1 por encima de la media al igual que los micr\u00f3fonos que cumplen perfectamente su trabajo. Para acabar los a\u00f1adidos, la computadora cuenta con una versi\u00f3n muy limpia de Windows que solo incluye aplicaciones que realmente resultan \u00fatiles para el control del equipo, como control de ventiladores, de iluminaci\u00f3n del teclado entres otras.Para empezar el apartado de las especificaciones, cuenta con 8gb de memoria DDR4 a 3200mhz en configuraci\u00f3n single-channel, ampliable hasta 32gb en dual-channel pues cuenta con un espacio libre SO-DIMM, siguiendo con la ampliaci\u00f3n y mejoras que puede tener, hay un espacio libre para un HDD para el cual se incluyen el cable y los tornillos necesarios en la caja, si se instala dicho disco duro opcional, no se podr\u00e1 mejorar la bater\u00eda que actualmente es de 48wh (Que da m\u00e1s de 4 horas para tareas b\u00e1sicas y pocos menos de 2 horas para juegos demandantes) por la versi\u00f3n de 90wh, cuenta con un solo slot M.2, por lo que el almacenamiento NVMe de 512gb que incluye actualmente es intercambiable al igual que la tarjerta de red, Wi-Fi 5 Bluetooth 5.0 instalada debajo de este, eso es todo lo que podemos cambiar en esta laptop.Para hablar del procesador y las GPU (se alternan los gr\u00e1ficos incluidos en el procesador con los dedicados seg\u00fan lo pesada que es la tarea que estemos realizando), tienen un rendimiento excelente, totalmente acorde y mejor al que deber\u00edan de tener, incluso puede mejorar si se actualiza la memoria ram a dual-channel, sin embargo la ventilaci\u00f3n no es la mejor y har\u00e1 que estos componentes lleguen a temperaturas al estar bajo mucho estr\u00e9s muy altas (que a\u00fan as\u00ed no llegan a ser peligrosa y no calientan el teclado) que ponen en riesgo la vida \u00fatil de estos y haciendo que los ventiladores sean realmente ruidosos, sin embargo hay soluciones muy simples a esto como desactivar el Boost del procesador lo cual recomiendo AMPLIAMENTE y dejo el tutorial que segu\u00ed: https://youtu.be/GPJ5tQ6zmOM , pues as\u00ed es como usar\u00e9 mi equipo normalmente, sin embargo hay otras soluciones como Ryzen Controller, programa que us\u00e9 para las pruebas de rendimiento que adjunto (A la derecha y arriba est\u00e1n temperaturas originales, a la izquierda y abajo est\u00e1n temperaturas con la herramienta \u201cLimitar temperatura \ufffd?de Ryzen Controller, configurada a 78\u00b0)Para estas pruebas que realic\u00e9 primero est\u00e1n las excelentes las velocidades de lectura y escritura del almacenamiento medidas con CrystalDisk, despu\u00e9s los benchmarks de renderizado (Cinebench y Firestrike) con temperaturas y resultados originales del lado derecho y el de arriba, y la temperatura limitada a la izquierda y arriba. Est\u00e1n 2 Benchmarks y pruebas en 3 juegos: Uno demandante de CPU (Cyberpunk 2077) en configuraci\u00f3n m\u00ednima, uno demandante de GPU (Fortnite) en configuraci\u00f3n competitiva y uno que equilibra el uso de CPU y GPU (Batman Arkham Knight) en configuraci\u00f3n alta con Gameworks desactivado y el benchmark que incluye.En conclusi\u00f3n recomiendo ampliamente este equipo para todo aquel que pueda sacarle provecho, pues adem\u00e1s de que tiene muuy poco en contra, seguir\u00e1 considerandose potente por varios a\u00f1os adem\u00e1s de que por su precio es sin duda la mejor opci\u00f3n que encontraremos especialmente con una tienda tan segura como Amazon, \u00a1espero encuentres \u00fatil esta rese\u00f1a!", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Pretty sure that this laptop is officially dead, no warning other than one blue screen a day or so ago. Was turned away from it, with it plugged in and charging while I played a game on my xbox, turn back to check my cell phone and not a single light was on. Assumed maybe it came unplugged, maybe plug wasnt working, maybe its the cord.. long story short its none of those things its definitely the laptop. Never will I buy a MSI computer ever again. Not even sure I will ever touch the parts again. Not planning to contact the company because their customer service has been rude and unhelpful every time I have spoken to them about any of their products/services. I saw an affordable laptop, with decent specs from a name that seemed trusted in the tech community, and I went for it. Don't waste your money on their products. Please, maybe spend a little more on something from a brand with less issues. If this is how they handled this laptop with its issues when it was fresh to market, I can't imagine they behave any better about their newer models.I have really mixed feelings about this laptop. I like the design, and theoretically the stats are pretty good. In use, it doesn't work out quite so well. I knew I would need to upgrade the ram, but out of the box this computer has always been on the slower side. It can play some games fine but struggles with several. For example, multiplayer games like Terraria to games like Black Desert Online seem to make this laptop struggle to keep up. And no, its not my internet connection. My internet can handle 3 people streaming and two people playing mmo's without really breaking a sweat. On the laptop I lose frames, it freezes up now and then, crashes the games, and the fans kick on their high setting at a moments notice. Which are very very loud by the way. On the plus side, the laptop doesn't overheat much.The display is really poor quality. Trying to watch or play anything where the movie or game intends it to be dim or look like night time is pretty bad because it all starts to look the same. I have tried to adjust these settings with the programs provided but it seems to not make much of a difference.The battery life on this is awful, but I knew that when I bought it. It doesn't take a year to charge up, so I don't gripe much on it. However, the location and charger style is incredibly inconvenient. A laptop meant for gamers, in a world where the majority is right handed, puts one usb slot on the right side not far from the charge port, where the cord design lines up the charger cord to run along the side of the laptop. Plug-in mouse setup can be annoying because I either have to fix the charger to point out the back (which would be fine if it weren't for the point of laptops to be travel) or it overlaps my mouse usb and the charge cord aomwtimes will get in the way. Its a minor design annoyance, but I felt was worth mentioning.Last but not least, the built in camera is useless. First, it tries to make you pay for the ability to use the camera because it doesnxt come already registered or with a code for the software that makes the camera operable. I sought assistance on the MSI site and felt treated a little rudely when offered a solution. The solution was a little convoluted but worked, where I also felt like I had been thrown back in time to my old baseball sized logitech webcam from when I was a kid. I live decently far from family so skype calls are important to me so I can catch up with them and see how they are. The camera quality is rough. And then, amusingly enough, the camera stopped working again entirely. It doesn't detect that I have one, regardless of installing or uninstalling drivers or anything else. The whole camera saga really irritated me. It decided not to exist right before a discord D&D session. Embarassing and frustrating to go through all the crap to make the camera work (This is how it is shipped by the way, not an accident in set up or anything! They literally put webcam hardware in the laptop that they don't bother having registered the software. I've never experieced this in my life, so it boggles my mind that this is standard for this laptop) only to have it become useless again. So if cameras aren't that important, I suppose don't worry about it. Or if they are and you have your heart set on this laptop, just save yourself the frustration and buy a camera to plug in.On the plus side, I enjoy the size, shape, weight, and design of the laptop. I appreciate the cooling abilities. MSI is a company I generally like a lot, and I don't feel like this laptop represents the quality of their company as a whole. With a little love, patience, and a chunk of money I can fix most of the issues I have with this computer. My bone to pick is that when you buy a laptop like this, you shouldn't have to go through all this when most other laptops (Especially with this pricetag) work as intended right out of the box. I've owned and worked with laptops ranging from crappy tiny netbooks to macbook pros. These are problems I only ever encountered on low end computers, except the camera. That was a doozy, and a new one for me.Oh! Advice in regards to the harddrivev before you set anything else up after you get it up and running, change the drive locations of your folders like Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc. Use the main hard drive mostly for the operating system (sincr its small) and put everything else on the secondary drive. That is how it is intended and will save you drom MSI alerts constantly telling you your HD is full. I forgot a couple times and installed things on the main HD instead and the pop ups were a mild nuisance.If i find better solutions for some of these problems, I will update my review with how I got it fixed. I bought this laptop in February 2018, Reviewing it November 2018.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Return 1 (contains new requirements) or 0 (does not contain new requirements).\n", "input": "I got this laptop to replace my aging 2011 Macbook Air, which is a great computer and would have lasted several more years if I hadn't spilled water on it. This Lenovo Flex is a little heavier (3.67lbs compared to the Air's 2.96lbs) but much more powerful and with a higher resolution screen.The full HD screen looks great. It's bright and has vivid color. The sound system is excellent for a laptop, but there's no defying physics, so good headphones or external speakers will obviously sound better than even the best laptop speakers.The laptop, with its onyx black finish, looks modern and stylish. I like the keyboard a lot; the keys have a perfect amount of \"click\" to them. There are three USB3 ports - two of which are the regular \"type A\" USB ports and one of the newer \"type C\" ports. There's also an SD card reader and an HDMI output, as well as a built-in microphone, headphone jack, and 720p webcam.Battery life is very good with up to 8 hours of run time. The battery has an \"express charge\" mode but I haven't needed to use this because it charges pretty quickly even in regular mode.The screen is a touch screen so you can also use this in \"tablet mode\". Personally, I haven't found much use for this feature. The best thing about it is the screen flips all the way back, or you can flip it back three-quarters of the way and make an inverted \"V\" shape and stand it up that way. I don't like muddying up the screen with my fingerprints so I use this in regular laptop mode 99% of the time.I have had very little exposure to the Windows world over the last 10 years. I love OSX (now macOS) and I still think it's a superior operating system in terms of ease of use and security, but after familiarizing myself with Windows 10 I think it's a decent operating system and I have no problems using it. Just be sure to pay attention to the privacy settings when you're setting up Windows for the first time, because the default settings share a LOT of data with Microsoft. I specifically turned off the \"share typing data\" option because that sounds scarily like a keylogger and I'm not sure I trust Microsoft to have access to all my keystrokes.There are only two minor things I dislike: one is the length of the power adapter cord - it's only about 6 feet long and I'm used to the Apple adapters that come with an extension to reach almost 12 feet. The 6 foot cord is a little limiting and I wish it were just a little longer. The other issue is that you can't easily open the laptop with one hand. You need to hold the lower section in place while you flip up the screen because the hinge is very strong, so otherwise the bottom starts to flip up. This is only a minor quibble, and it's great that the hinges are so strong.Overall, this is a great laptop with no major drawbacks that I can see. It's a very good value for the money. It's super fast. It's quiet - most of the time it's silent, but when the cooling fan comes on during processor intensive operations, it's not very loud - I'd say it's comparable to the Macbook Air in terms of fan noise. The Nvidia GeForce MX130 GPU is plenty powerful for smooth video and gaming, and it supports CUDA for hardware-accelerated processing in applications such as Adobe Premiere Pro.Lenovo did a great job with this laptop and I highly recommend it!", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I wrote some notes and added them to the return package. I seems like they listened! I had mentioned that one of their tech support agents had hinted that the issue was the graphics card. On their return notes they stated that the graphics card (I believe this would mean the whole motherboard) had been replaced. So far, I have not been able to replicate the main issue I was having, which was freezing streaky screens, which used to gravely affect my editing work. I must mention that I have not pushed the machine too much, just enough. The problem was that the freezing-streaking issue used to happen even without pushing the graphics card too hard. So, I'm happier with how it is working now, nearly two years after I purchased it.There are some caveats, however. 1. When I change the \"User Scenario\" from Extreme Performance to either Balanced or Super Battery the machine has either crashed or become unstable. I pretty much keep it on Extreme mode most of the time as I do a lot of heavy tasks. I had switched to balanced because I was using it it where I couldn't plug it and I needed the battery to last longer. 2. Although I haven't experienced the Freeze and streaks issue the laptop kind of resets my displays and seems to reset the Windows Explorer environment (but I take that over freezing and loosing my work) once in a while. I had seen this issue about 3 times now since getting it back but, surprisingly, no major crashes, other than the ones stated on point number 1 above.I'm glad that MSI kept their word and honored the warranty. I mentioned before that I had extended the warranty but, by the time I had to send it back the second time, even the extended had expired. It was understood, however, that the first fix they tried (which was practically zero) didn't work, and I was still under warranty, so they had to make it right even when my original warranty had expired.I do recommend if you're going to send yours back for repair, that you send it back with all the original components (RAM and perhaps even the Hard Drive, but mainly RAM). That way they will not \"misdiagnose\" your machine and send it back to you with no real work done (see previous updates for more context).I upped my rating from 1 star to 3 since it was a real pain in the *** to get it all straighten. (keeping fingers cross for the next 5 years ;-) )UPDATE 2 May/22Support has not improved. Admittedly, they say that \"translating\" the messages causes some delays and misunderstandings.Anyways here's the scoop:I sent the device back as is still under warranty. I had to pay for shipping however. They \"tested\" it and coincidentally, the only thing that \"failed\" was the RAM. Mind you I'm a technician myself and I've tested the RAM and it's in perfect working condition. The kicker is, of course, is that I upgraded the RAM, so it's not the original one. But, I upgraded the RAM thinking that would help with the issues I was having. NOPE. The laptop fails with the original RAM on board and with the upgraded RAM, which happens to be SAMSUNG. So, I got good quality perfectly working RAM for my new laptop (not so new anymore) but it didn't help with the freezing/crashing issue. I'm requesting for them to retest the device with the original RAM (since they say my upgrade is a \"failed one\").Needless to say, It has been an extremely slow and frustrating process, between how busy I am, the slow replies, the 'misunderstandings', having to explain to them the same thing over and over. This is probably the first and last MSI machine I'll ever buy.Update 4/6. Support keeps ignoring my messages, at least directly on their site. I will have to try their live chat service to see if that makes any difference. When something like this happens you cannot recommend their product. Even sometimes when the product is not \"high end\" but they have good support it makes them look better and you appreciate their business more. So far MSI is letting me down big time. Shame.I must start by saying that this is a powerful machine and when it works it's great. UNFORTUNATELY! I've been experiencing constant crashes/freezes when doing video editing. Needless to say that, crashes you experience when you are \"creating\" is the worst that could happen. You gotta have reliability in what you use as your main tool for video editing, you spend good money on it and expect it to do its job. This hasn't been the case for this laptop. From my very first project I experienced the first crashes and I thought an update had taken care of that initial problem, but, alas! I started another project recently and crash after crash was the story for a while. Oddly, the machine could go almost full 24hrs with no crashes, and the next day crash on me 3 or 4 times almost in a row. I had attached 2 external monitors to it and that seemed to upset things more, I had to unplug one of them to mitigate the issue. I'm concerned about whether I got a \"lemon\"? Other reviewers here seem to have good experiences and little to none issues. The other point I want to make is that, yes, a full year warranty is offered but I recently contacted their Support team about this problem, and I got a dry short answer, \"do this, then do that\" No explanation as to what could be wrong, no warning as to what the suggested 'fix' risks are, etc. Not impressed so far, but I'll update this review and rating when and if the issues are taken care of.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I spent my lives 5 years of savings.It came with Mal ware called Windows, I uninstalled it and installed Ubuntu. Windows made it to run like its running in 5% of power to maximize battery, everything lagged and nothing opened, full lag. and once I installed Ubuntu everything is just great , but battery drains in 2 hours, but works well, super fast . I also removed spinning hard dusk as ssd was sufficient for me,Positives --1) Extremely Powerful2) I have used 6 year old laptops till now, hence Display is great for me, however as per todays laptop standard display is poor and holographic.3) very quite laptop.4) Asus has guaranteed qualities5) a honest laptop with good quality control and excellent engineering.6) Very slim lapi,7) Extremely bright display8) Soothing sensation to eyes, very eye freindly and brightness can be reduced to upto zero, hence best reading book too. work non stop and never felt eye strain, Love you asus for thisNegatives -1) Keyboard and keyboard buttons are not having click feedback and rubbery feel,2) has action like pressing on some flex not much bit high performance users like me will feel middle part flexy.3) keyboard light comes out of edges, looks very very bad ad cheap.4) for this cost I expected better keyboard.5) I opened laptop and saw the sheet metal on top of palm rest is extremely thin and can be dented with light knocks, never expected it to be so thin,6) don't want windows, wanted DOS version, while it might had reduced cost also. I completely replaced with Ubuntu.Overall tis is very good laptop and I am not sure of durability,But I think I should had invested on top end apple, even though it might have costed me 4K$, still it is gold standards.I honestly expect keyboard to be better,After installing Ubuntu display brightness FN+F5/F6 and keyboard brightness FN+F3/F4 didn't work, tried all available solutions from Internet and nothing worked, at last I wrote driver for it in one night and now working great. I will write a blog to publish my solution.I tried Opensuse as it is my love from 10 years, but nvidia drivers failed in opensuse leap 42.2/3 , and even opensource display drivers started giving huge issues related to frequent desktop freezing, below one hour battery, loud fan noice and increased temperature. hence installed ubuntu LTS and everything working great in Nvidia drivers, keep microcode drivers on as I dont know why to keep it off.the only issue I faced is keyboard backlight and display backlight modulation from function key for with I wrote a script to manually increment and decrement brightness of both in rust lang and linked to keyboard shortcuts windows button for Fn, and everything works great.those who want a beautiful eye catching powerful machine, this is you best bet, I think GL553VE has more quality over this, but single fan pushed me back.however this is very slim laptop. go for it.One last thing, I dont know how asus does it, in mobile phones and laptops , in both they give best display which wont destroy the eyes,Great Asus for this, love you", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Actually Civilization ran well later in the game where it would usually slow down a lot on my old laptop, so that was nice.Overall I think this is a nice gaming laptop at its price point.

This laptop offers both a high end laptop NVIDIA graphics card (RTX 3060) and a fairly high end 11th generation Intel processor (I7-11800H). They include a 144Hz refresh rate FHD display. They throw in a fast 512Gb NVMe boot drive, a Killer/Intel Ax1650i Ethernet/WiFi system, and a generous array of laptop ports. All at a price that's considerably cheaper than competitors are asking laptops with comparable specs.If you're looking for specs at the best price, this has what you're looking for. Add to that good quality build, a very efficient fan/vent system, and decent aesthetics, and you may think about ending your search now. Because you won't find a comparable quality system with comparable specs for less.But there are some downsides. Battery life is pretty poor. You'll get maybe 3.5-4 hours if you put the laptop in Default mode, turn down the brightness, and focus on tasks that don't require the NVIDIA GPU. So, for example, simple video streaming or web surfing. 3.5 hours is not enough for a long plane trip, nor for a take-along laptop for a whole day's classes. And things get a lot worse if you put it into gaming mode (e.g. Turbo). Compared to 10+ hours available with today's road warrior laptops, you can see what you're getting into here. This isn't a gaming laptop that doubles as a do-everything portable. If you need portable and good battery life (and lighter weight--this weighs 5 1/2 pounds), consider something else. This is fine for a trip to the coffee shop for an hour or two.But if you're a gamer first, you may well be willing to make that trade off.Beyond the weak battery life, the other significant negative about this laptop is the keyboard. For reasons I don't fathom on a gaming laptop, Acer has chosen to shrink the keyboard on the left side to make room for a dedicated keypad. As a result, I find typing cramped, and find myself frequently hitting the wrong key. The chicklet style keys are also not the most comfortable I've used on a laptop. If you're using this at home, you'll almost certainly want to move to an external keyboard. Which is kind of a shame since the backlit keyboard, with the colored LEDS, IS quite pretty for a laptop keyboard.Two other so-so components are the Webcam--which only supports HD (1280x720) and isn't all that great, and the built-in speakers. The speakers get the job done, but don't get that loud and are fairly lacking in bottom end. I've heard better laptop speakers, for sure.Balancing out the weaknesses in battery and keyboard is plenty of easy expandability and upgradability. There are THREE (!!!) mass storage connections in the laptop: Two NVMe connections (one holding the boot drive from the factory), and a place for a third, 2.5\" drive. There are two memory slots, one of which holds the 16Gb memory stick for the base configuration. A maximum of 32Gb are supported, if you add a second 16Gb stick. The WiFi card is also easily accessed once the back cover is off, if you decide you want to upgrade the WiFi capabilities in the future. Removing the back cover is straightforward: Remove 11 screws on the bottom, then carefully pry the cover off (there are a few clips around the edges that will release with a careful pull).Unlike many recent laptops, Acer is pretty generous here with connection ports. You get:1x Thunderbolt 4 port (USB-C)1x USB (Type A) 3.2 gen 2 (10 Mb/s)2x USB (Type A) 3.2 gen 1 (5Mb/s)1x HDMI1x Mini-Displayport1 x Gigabit Ethernet port1/8\" headphone jackThe inclusion of both the latest-and-greatest Thunderbolt 4 port (capable of both 40 Mb/s speeds and supporting up to 2 x 4K/60Hz or 1x 8K/60Hz monitor) is a plus. It's also nice there are three type-A USB ports, all of which are USB 3, and one of which is the faster USB 3.2 gen type. Providing support for both Mini-DisplayPort AND HDMI is icing on the cake.Power is supplied via a barrel-type power port on the back of the laptop. The power supply is rated for up to 200W. There's no indication that the laptop can be charged through the Thunderbolt port, and there are few generic charger options for 200W in any event.Value added software included with the laptop includes a copy of the excellent video editing program Cyberlink Powerdirector, the the DTS sound processing application for speakers attached through the 1/8\" mini-jack. There's also a control program for the Killer/Intex Ax1650i card.I ran the popular 3D Mark benchmarking program on the laptop in three modes: Balanced, Extreme, and Turbo. These three modes can be toggled through the Acer/Predator app that comes pre-installed. Turbo mode can also be toggle on/off via a dedicated button the keyboard. Results for the benchmark game Time Spy are (see photos):Balanced: Graphics Score: 7057, CPU Score: 6403Extreme: Graphics Score: 7568, CPU Score 7616Turbo: Graphics Score 7884, CPU Score 7684The various modes appear to be doing what they should, with the scores improving as you ladder up in overclocking. Given the nominal improvement for Extreme-> Turbo, which also turns on the loud fans permanently, I am not sure that's a power option most people will choose.SummarizingProsHigh end discrete graphics card (NVIDIA RTX 3060)Good cpu (Intel I7-11800H @ 2.30Ghz, 8 cores, 16 thread)Very generous port assortment, including Thunderbolt 4144Hz 3ms refresh rate FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS screen, no touchFast NVMe 512Gb boot drive (Samsung MZVL2512HCJQ-0080)Expansion for TWO additional storage devices (1xNVME, 1x 2.5\" drive)Expansion for additional memory stickBack cover relatively easy to remove to access componentsComes with Cyberlink Powerdirector and DTS softwareOffers multiple pre-tuned options for speed/overclock/fan noiseVery pretty backlit keyboard with multi-color LEDsConsOnly fair battery life (< 4 hours in nominal use mode, closer to 2 hours in Turbo game mode)Keyboard squeezed to make way for number pad and a bit uncomfortable/clumsy to use long termUnder stress, fans are very loudWeak built-in speakersMediocre built-in webcamOnly comes with 16Gb of memory, 32Gb would have been preferred512Gb of storage is fine for productivity apps, but gamers will almost certainly require more for gamesDespite the cons, I think this is a lot of laptop for the price, and as long as you can live with the practical need to be on a power source if you're going to do any serious gaming with it, this is probably going to be the most attractive gaming laptop for a lot of people at its price point.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I am not sure why they are selling this instead of the US variant. However, that is what Asus told me. I haven\u2019t noticed any difference between this and the US version, so I do not see any issue with buying this instead.Short Review: This device is a solid machine. It fits a powerful and capable amount of hardware, in a clean and slim design. The screen suffers from bad viewing angles and subpar colors, but is still good enough for most tasks. Overall, this device is quite the bargain when you consider the form factor, performance, and features you are getting for the price.Full Detail Review:- The CPU(i7-7700HQ) is great. It can do pretty much anything you want it to. I am not particularly heavy on computers, but I tested a little bit of After Effects on here and the device handled it very easily. Chrome is no issue when bundled with the 16GB of RAM on this machine. The i7-7700HQ is about as good as you are going to get in a laptop right now, so you really can't complain in terms of CPU performance.- The integrated GPU is solid. The GTX 1050 can handle just about any game you throw at it, given it isn\u2019t a AAA title from this year. Overwatch runs at 60FPS on medium graphics. Dirt 3 runs at 110 FPS on ultra-graphics, and Civ 5/6 have no issues running on this device. If the GPU power is a concern for you, go check out some reviews on YouTube about the GTX 1050, that will be able to give you a full rundown on this GPU. Note: It also has Integrated Intel HD 630 Graphics, those are solid too, but irrelevant to the main graphics performance.- Cooling is not an issue under normal performance. It runs completely cool and quiet when performing simple tasks or just browsing Chrome. When gaming, the device really heats up and the fans get rather loud. It gets very hot, seeing temperatures push into 150 degrees Fahrenheit. I absolutely advise against gaming on a bed with this, this is a flat surface gaming machine, hands down. It isn\u2019t something that would comfortably rest on your lap. This laptop is a tabletop gaming machine but if you are just writing a paper or browsing chrome, it\u2019s comfortable in your laptop or wherever you can safely use it. However, my device did have an issue with one of the fans after just about a week of use. The left fan was working at Max load, while the right wouldn't spin up at all. This resulted in a machine that got hotter than I could touch. I attempted to contact Asus about my issues but their Support is a nightmare and reaching someone who can actually help you diagnose the problem, is a rare occurrence.- The SSD(250GB) is fantastic! Boot times are insane! Average boot time from being completely off is about 5-7 seconds. I loaded all my core programs to the SSD and left the 1TB HDD to be the data drive. So far it has been a perfect combination. Everything performs just great! Storage isn't an issue and with the SSD, the speed is amazing.- The main thing that brought me to this machine is that it isn't coated in ugly red RGB lighting and \"gamer\" aesthetics. The device is clean. It isn\u2019t hard to compare this design to a MacBook(Minus the full aluminum uni-body, I will talk about this later). You can walk into your office with this thing and still look professional. It does a good job of packing a lot of power into a relatively small body.- According to Asus, the device has an all-aluminum body. I can confirm that the device is in fact Aluminum, but has an odd feel to it. It is almost like they painted the metal with plastic. The device does not feel like a MacBook or Zenbook. It feels sturdy and good, but it leaves you wanting that raw metal touch. It does have that chilled metal feel to it, so it is obviously metal. However, I do know that the bottom of this device is plastic, it doesn't get cool like the rest of the device, doesn't feel the same, and just looks like plastic. This was obviously either a cost saving or performance related cut that Asus took to keep this device in a more affordable category. Rest assured however, it doesn't really take away from the overall feel off the device. When interacting with the laptop you are always in contact with metal and it feels really nice.- The trackpad is in a good place for me. It is out of the way when typing and I don\u2019t mistakenly hit it. This is subjective to how each person uses the device, but in my experience, I have no complaints with the placement of the trackpad. The trackpad also performs fine for me. It has some weird gestures that I am not sure how I keep activating, but as far as usability, it is good. The buttons are clicky and tactile, however, I have an issue sometime moving the cursor while trying to click. I am just not used to this kind of trackpad.-The keyboard is good. It has reasonable travel and I haven\u2019t experienced any major flexing in the keyboard. The backlight works well and it has 3 brightness options. The numpad is weird and kind of feels out of place. I would prefer if they hadn\u2019t added one on this model, because it just feels so squished and incomplete. However if a trackpad is desired, this model features one, albeit a small one.- The sound on this laptop is good. It has two speakers on the bottom of the device. They can get muffled a little if you use this on your lap, but on a flat surface, they really perform well. They get much louder than anything I have ever owned and hit the high tones well. Bass is decent, it gets deeper than most laptops in this form factor but I can\u2019t expect a lot from something this size either. Some people have complained about speakers distrorting after going over a certain volume. I haven't really experienced this and it may be because I use the included Software utility to choose sound modes. This tool is what Asus claims, will make the device loud without distortion. So perhaps not using this tool could be the issue, but I cannot confirm this.- The screen is the what made this device lose a star from me. It\u2019s a FHD(1920x1080) TN panel. The viewing angles are quite awful and colors look slightly washed out when looking horizontally or vertically at an angle. The screen is a matte material, so reflections aren\u2019t a problem. Seeing as how I paid $1000 for this laptop, I expect a premium display and an IPS display would help a lot. (This laptop is still one of the best for the buck on Amazon though) I also have two small areas on my screen with pixels that are not working right. It\u2019s a small issue that causes a small area to look slightly brighter and kind of washed out. I am going to see if Asus will replace/repair the device, because it can get annoying.- Battery life is not the best, but is about what you would expect on a device with a high-performance CPU and GPU. I get about 4-5 hours of battery life when doing basic and simple tasks. However, I only get about 1-2 hours when playing high intensity games. It is important to note that it charges very fast. I have not gotten a complete measurement, but it charges faster than other laptops I have owned.- The network card on this laptop is great. It has good connectivity and achieves the max speeds of my network. I have no complaints about the network card.*Shipping Issue* This device arrived in a box that was much bigger than it should have been. The box was easily twice the size that it needed to be and there was no protection inside the box. There was literally a laptop box inside a much bigger shipping box (see picture), nothing to pad it or protect it. I hope Amazon fixes this issue because it isn\u2019t at all safe to ship this device like that. My screen has a small issue that might have been cause by this shipping issue. NOTE: I contacted Amazon about my complaints with the packaging and they offered me a generous compensation or replacement, whichever I chose. The shipping issue will hopefully be resolved soon.Disclaimer: I returned this product. I was having an issue with one of the fans not working. I attempted to contact Asus. To say the least, their support is garbage! I contacted them via chat, phone, and twitter. Everytime I was met with long delays or disconnects. I couldn't speak to someone who could help me, often times even getting someone who seemed like they didn't even know Asus made laptops. Eventually Asus's Twitter got back to me, but they insisted that I just send it in. They offered no diagnostic. I needed this machine and I at least needed to know what was wrong and how long it would take, they offered no answers and said that was all they could do. With that in mind I started a refund with Amazon. This laptop is really good if it fits your needs and isn't broken. However once you do have an issue with the hardware, you enter into a support Hell. I really hope Asus fixes their support. For now I am going to check out the XPS 15.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I was so impressed with how fast programs seemed to download and install. It was pretty amazing to me. Even in comparison to a relatively new and powerful laptop owned by my wife, this was far quicker and snappier.I was disappointed in finding out that it uses a proprietary charger. I was really hoping it would be a usb c charger. Can't win them all.I had to settle for a non touch laptop. In order to get the other components, the graphics card and the processor etc, I wasn't able to find a combo with a touchscreen so I had to settle for this. But this is not a negative on this laptop.Even coming out of the box you could tell it was premium. The packaging was really good and protective. It even came inside a soft cloth bag. First time I've had a laptop come that way.The screen is sharp and very clear. Obviously, I still need to test it and put it through it's paces to see how beautiful things will look but the few video clips i put up sounded and looked great.Update: I reduced the rating by 1 star all related to 1 thing. Battery life. I lowered the refresh rate on the screen to 60hz with intent to increase it if and when I game. With settings like this, the laptop seems like it would run for around 5 hours but that's an estimate. And that is not bad. Throw in something that uses the gpu and you get very little. In fact, I was running a golf simulator program called e6 and casting the screen to a 2nd laptop screen. In that mode, this laptop died in about an hour. I shouldn't be surprised though as nobody would game on battery power... Not for a serious gaming session. I still thought I'd get more than 1 hour.Other than that, the laptop performance is spot on and pretty amazing. Crisp and snappy... Fast. Coming from a 6 yr old unit...

If you just want the highlights, hop down to the bottom for a summary)I used to be a PC gamer. Sure I had a console for the exclusives, but my PC was my gaming home. Somewhere along the line though that flipped. I got tired of upgrading and tweaking my PCs performance so I went to mostly console gaming. Well, I\u2019ve decided to make my return to PC gaming with the help of this Predator laptop from Acer. Read on to find out why I'm a big fan of this laptop at this price.The packaging for the Predator is a nice surprise. It is truly a premium experience that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect in a laptop at this price range. The entire package is shipped in a separate plain cardboard box to protect it during transit (which it did). The retail box on the other hand is a black box with Predator branding on it. Once you crack that open you\u2019re greeted with a small sealed hard cardboard box with a holographic logo that contains the laptop in a black cloth sleeve. Word of warning though: I got a pretty aggressive static shock when I pulled the laptop out of the sleeve. It doesn\u2019t seem to have affected the laptop at all thankfully. The package also contains a folded paper sleeve with the important documents in it including a nice thick cardstock welcome card emblazoned with blue foil letters. Overall, it really felt premium. And as a nice added bonus, it comes with a softshell zip-up neoprene case.The laptop itself is a little on the bigger side (but in the 15\u201d size range, this is to be expected). The casing is a mixture of machined aluminum (with a black powder coating) on the lid and keyboard deck and plastic casing on the screen, bottom body, and hinge assembly. I assume that the mixed media is a cost-saving measure and considering the performance (which I\u2019ll get to in a bit) versus the price, I\u2019m A-OK with that decision. Overall it has a clean look with some chamfered edges on the aluminum exposing the silver color underneath in a kind of outlining effect. It looks cool. There are some angles on the lid/body that I\u2019m not a huge fan of, but I get wanting to add distinctiveness to the laptop so I won\u2019t hold design aesthetics against it.The input options are decent and inline with other laptops of this price range. The left-hand side gives you a physical LAN port (Gigabit only, but that\u2019s to be expected at this price) and two USB-A (3.2) ports. The right-hand side sports a mini displayport (an interesting choice in this day and age), full-sized HDMI, one USB-A (3.2), and one USB4 type C (Thunderbolt) port. The power adapter port is on the back. Honestly, I\u2019d rather have had two USB4 ports on one side and two USB-A on the other. But I\u2019m just happy to have Thunderbolt at all. It is worth noting though that you can\u2019t power the laptop through the USB4 port as you can with other laptops. Its power demand is too high (at up to 205w) and requires the beefier power adapter it came with.Before I really dig into the general functionality of Predator, I want to talk about the PredatorSense app that Acer includes (it even has its own dedicated button on the keyboard). It\u2019s going to be the command center for general controls of the \u2018gamer-centric\u2019 features. You can use it to tweak everything from the fan speed to the keyboard backlight color and pulse modes. It\u2019s a pretty convenient feature and thankfully the button on the keyboard is located far away from typical gaming keys so you shouldn\u2019t accidentally activate it too often.Speaking of keys, the backlit keyboard supports a full range of RGB with 4 zones of light control. There are a number of dynamic modes to determine how the zones light up and in what order. It also has the ability to select from a predetermined range of colors *or* a point-and-choose/hex color tool so you get a pretty huge customization range in that regard. The keyboard deck has a good amount of stability and not too much give. Combined with a decent amount of key travel, it produces a pleasant typing experience (apart from the fact that I\u2019m so used to a natural keyboard now).The touch pad is\u2026 passable. I\u2019ve been using a Mac at home for years now and the touchpad on that is second-to-none. It\u2019s a little jarring going from that to the Predator\u2019s ultra-sensitive clicks. I have accidentally clicked a left or right click more times in three days on this than in the last 10 years on my MacBook Pro. That said, you\u2019re almost certainly not gaming with the trackpad. And in general use (word processing, surfing the web, etc.) it works just fine.The screen is a gorgeous 1920x1080 144hz beast with a 3ms response time. In my benchmark and gaming tests (coming up) I found it to be a fantastic companion to the GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card. The only complaint I have is that there is a fair bit of light bleed in the upper corners. If you are frequently in a dark room, this could be noticeable.The sound of the Predator is serviceable. There isn\u2019t really any bass to speak of and the highs are a little tinny. The real concern when it comes to sound is the laptop fan noise. If you enable turbo mode (see below) or have an extended gaming session, the fan can really kick on. You can still hear the audio ok at the top volume, but the people around you might not like you for the noise you\u2019re making. Honestly if you\u2019re serious about gaming, you\u2019re going to want to get a 7.1 surround headset, making the audio a moot point.The Predator is equipped with an 11th gen Intel i7 11800H processor (at the laptop TDP ceiling of 45w). While they\u2019ve been lagging behind AMD in performance for a couple of years now, they hope to change things with their 11 gen platform. I\u2019m not going to push hard number results here as this isn\u2019t a technical review. That said, in my benchmarks, I found the i7 to be excellent. It performed in the 78th percentile, which is realy great for a mid-tier laptop (especially considering that it was up against desktop class processors in that comparison).One of the things that has kept me from committing to a gaming laptop was the availability of a good graphics card in this price range. When I saw that this laptop had the GeForce RTX 3060, I had to jump on it. I\u2019ve read only good things about the 3000 series from Nvidia and I was not disappointed. While I have some tweaking to do on the graphics driver side of things, I found its performance to be generally outstanding.The storage and memory on this laptop are great baselines for a gaming machine. It has a 512GB Samsung SSD. The throughput was more than suitable for gaming at high speeds, though you may outgrow the size pretty quickly (512Gb is on the small size these days, but to be expected at this price point). The memory included is 16Gb of DDR4. That\u2019s a pretty average number and while I\u2019d like to see 32Gb, it\u2019s not necessary.The battery life is about what I would expect from a laptop of this class. That is to say, it\u2019s ok, but not great. While performing general tasks like web browsing and watching Netflix, I can get anywhere from 4.5-6 hours depending on brightness and background tasks. While game, it\u2019s much worse. I averaged about 1h15m before it went into hibernation mode. However, I fully expect this while gaming, as it\u2019s very demanding.The last thing I\u2019ll discuss is the turbo button (ah, how I like to reminisce about those beige boxes of the 90s with their turbo buttons). It\u2019s a physical button on the Predator that when clicked, turns the fans on to full speed (they are quite loud) and slightly overclocks the Intel and Nvidia processors for slightly higher performance (I got about a 6-8% boost). It\u2019s a neat feature, just be prepared to get some noise cancelling headphones, as the fans do make quite a bit of noise.------------*The Good*: Powerful processor. Top-tier graphics performance. Premium feel. Custom tweaking app. Free case.*The Bad*: Fans can be loud. Default settings must be tweaked (performance is below average without doing so). Sound isn\u2019t great. Trackpad is so-so. Relatively small hard drive (SSD) size.*The Bottom Line:* At $1299 I think this is a pretty great laptop for gaming. You\u2019re going to make some trade offs in this price range, but they aren\u2019t even close to deal breakers. Just know that you\u2019re going to want a good gaming mouse and a 7.1 headset for the best experience. Five stars out of five for great power at a great price. I would definitely order this again.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

At a little over 1KG it's incredibly light, though because it's less than 12\" wide and 8\" deep that weight is quite concentrated. It feels dense in a way that no laptop I've ever used has felt, a hint that lots of exciting technology has been crammed into this tiny package.I don't do much intensive work day to day, but every few weeks I need to fire up Photoshop to do some fairly complex stuff that absolutely annihilates my old laptop. With 16GB of RAM and the Intel Iris Xe Graphics card this thing can stroll through the kind of work that would cause my old laptop to grind to a halt. What's more I can keep multiple processes working in the background while I work, so graphics work is no longer a grind.If you're looking for a small and extremely portable laptop that can handle anything you can throw at it, the Dell XPS 13 9310 is an excellent candidate. Yes, it's expensive, and I'm sure you can get a laptop with similar specs in a slightly less portable package for less, but I've never used a laptop with this much power that's small enough to toss in a tote bag. My only slight complaint is that it runs a little hot when you start to push it, because the heat needs to go somewhere and there just isn't enough room to dissipate it effectively. It's not enough to knock this down from a 5 star review, though.

Which I hope I will never need, but based on the reviews of previous Blade generations and this one, it seemed like a necessity. Especially when spending $3,000 on a laptop (I bought the 4K model).So far though about a week of owning it, absolutely zero problems. This laptop was out of stock the night before I wanted it and was in stock the next morning, so it must be a fresh off the assembly line machine. Which hopefully means any of the problems you see from reviews in the summer are less relevant (hopefully). That or I just got a great machine (so far). I can't find any flaws though and I absolutely love using the thing. Coming from a Macbook Pro that I was running in boot camp 90% of the time because I'm an architect and I live in a Windows world, I am satisfied with a beautiful device that is well designed and has a keyboard that, while it has taken some adjustment, I really love the feel of it. I'm not perfect with it yet by any means. Mainly because the keys are small and the space between them is larger than my Surface Book (my other work machine) and my Macbook.This thing is a beast. I play Destiny 2 a lot and it devours it. Awesome. I have peace of mind because I own several computers, but this one has the potential to be my favorite, easily. I don't fully trust Razer yet, but having the RazerCare makes me feel good. Amazon offers their own warranty's through third parties and I considered them for sure, but ultimately was scared of that too.For what it's worth, I think it's asking a lot for a machine with zero problems at all. My Surface Book does weird stuff and my Macbook has suffer a faulty logic board. So nothing is perfect. And the Razer may fail. It does get hot and loud. But out of the box, it's everything I could have asked and hoped for.I will update this if anything bad happens. If I never update, you can assume I'm still smiling at the gorgeous 4K screen.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I have had the unit for a week now and here are my impressions thus far. I was impressed with the way the unit was packed; almost AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNIT ITSELF. It arrived in pristine condition with nary a blemish anywhere. The initial setup took a bit more than 5 minutes, and went through with no problems. The keyboard felt good but a few key positions were weird. The screen was gorgeous with no bleed at all. These facts are really not that important to me as I use it hooked up to externals, but I can tell you the picture is breath taking on a 50\" HD panel.A day later there was an issue and the unit started having difficulty. Thankfully I had made recovery media and so was able to reinstall the OS. Approximately 7 hours later all updates were again done, and all my programs loaded. The only issue left was Armoury crate no longer worked. I called Asus support and within 5 minutes was speaking to a rep who was able to get my issue fixed within an hour.Now for the important stuff. This thing is a beast. I have run bench marks on it and it ran in the 90th percentile. All games run smoothly at their highest video levels. With some of the better done 3d games it is hard to tell if you are watching a movie with live people or a game. I did purchase a cooler pad with the unit and have not seen the temp go over 58 C yet. The only changes I made to the unit was I did up the memory to 32 gig as the unit only came with 16gb on a single chip. I also added an external 1TB SSD as it only had a 256 GB on board.Over all I found the laptop to be attractive without being too gamish. It has a solid well built feel to it; though it is a bit on the heavy side. Over all I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone that is looking for performance on a budget.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

It is understated and at the same time classy. Function leads form with this unit though form is not a distant second. Overall, the build quality is relatively solid and rugged. It is very compact and at first glance it comes off as something smaller than what you expect for a 15.6\u201d laptop due to the thin bezel design, which reduces the monitor\u2019s border considerably. The aluminum top cover is a nice touch and the glowing Legion logo on it gives it a cool look.The \u2018soft\u2019 rubberized keyboard deck has a nice feel and look to it though it could be more susceptible to smudges and fingerprints. I\u2019m also not sure how resistant it will be to scratching and I obviously don\u2019t want to put that to the test.The keyboard\u2019s key-touch is smooth, soft and quiet, perhaps too much so. It lacks the tactile and audible feedback I would prefer, but I can envision some liking it this way maybe. However, the key travel is good.The white backlit keyboard can be adjusted to 3 levels of illumination, and does a decent job.The i7 is super-fast and has no problem with running many multiple parallel apps swiftly. The display is respectably bright and displays consistent color regardless of viewing angle.The cooling system seems to be a very well and effective design. The support \u2018feet\u2019 on the base\u2019s underside surface provides a healthy clearance for the two massive air intake vents and the two massive area exhaust vents on the rear makes for an impressive cooling air flow; the best I\u2019ve seen, in fact. Fan noise at the highest speeds is much quieter than what I\u2019ve observed with other laptops.Battery life is about 6-1/2 hours under normal (i.e. internet and standard office apps), non-gaming use. I didn\u2019t do any gaming tests with it, but it is safe to assume that battery life would be appreciably lower for that loading scenario.Instead of at the top center edge of the screen as is customarily done, the webcam is located toward the bottom, hinged edge of the screen, slightly above the level of the keyboard. This makes for a less than desirable, from the chin up viewing angle rather than an eye level line of view. Your fingers appear in the line of sight if typing while video chatting.The two forward facing speakers on front edge of the deck are relatively large and produce good sound/volume. They are as optimally spaced as the laptop\u2019s size will accommodate and allows for as good of a stereo experience as this spacing limitation will allow for.It comes with 3 USB3 ports. One is located on the left side along with a combo headphone/microphone jack. Another USB3 port is located on the right side and the third is on the rear along with a USB Type C port (sadly does not support Thunderbolt 3), mini display port, HDMI output, GB Ethernet port, power port and Kensington lock.I really like that it didn\u2019t come loaded with bloatware other than the MacAfee trial, which can be easily uninstalled.It comes with 2 Lenovo utilities that are quite useful for system features management.All in all, on a scale of 1 to 10, I give this a 9. It is a respectably featured and well-executed design with an optimistic future, especially for something marketed as entry level. I expect it to serve me well for years to come.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

A few minor issues, but I am very happy with this computer as a whole. I bought this to replace an old Macbook, because I wanted something that could run powerful programs, games, and I could use in class. Overall a great general purpose machine that can do everything I want it to do. It may not be as exciting or sleak as my macbook, but for the price it functions super well and doesn't look half bad.Pros:* Great value: I bought the \"used - very good\" condition option from amazon warehouse deals with the i7/16gb RAM/256G SSD+1TB HDD. For the specs it has I couldn't find a cheaper computer. This machine is able to run anything I throw at it within reason without any trouble. I have never seen my RAM or CPU usage go above 60% even with many programs running at once (including some high powered ones like Engineering CAD programs).* Great graphics: I got the model with the 1050 GTX, and it works like a charm. For reference I can run GTAV on high settings at a consistent 60 fps, and PUBG on medium/high settings somewhere between 35 and 55 fps. Coming from my last laptop that had integrated graphics this is a huge upgrade.* Looks: I wanted a catch all computer. I wanted to be able to play games and run engineering programs without having RGB obnoxious alien ware everything. I also use this laptop in class and wanted to be able to carry it around and use it in professional settings. It doesn't look like anything special, but that kind of exactly what I wanted. I has all of the things you would expect on a laptop of this caliber (back lit keyboard, aluminum finish, etc.), but definitely doesn't compare on aesthetics to a Macbook or even some of Asus' flagship laptops like the Zenbook.* Charging speed: I read some reviews that said the charging speed was fast and that made up for poor battery life, and I was skeptical that it was really any faster than most laptops. It definitely is though.Cons:* Screen: I was hesitant about buying this laptop because of some of the reviews about the screen, and to be honest it isn't great. The contrast and color pallet are low, and the matte display is not exactly my favorite. It doesn't bother me for normal web browsing or document editing, but if I'm staring at the screen for a long time with low contrast content, like a dark movie or game, it can start to strain my eyes because of the low contrast. It's not a total deal breaker for this computer, but it is one of the major reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5.*Track pad: This may be just an issue with my particular computer, but the track pad isn't awesome. It works well 90% of the time, but 10% of the time it will lose responsiveness for a few seconds and then come back. It's not a huge issue for me because I use an external mouse most of the time, but I definitely notice the lack of quality in the track pad compared to friends Macbooks or other more high end laptops.* Battery life isn't amazing, but that is to be expected with such a high powered machine. I haven't tried optimizing for battery life very much, as I am usually near an outlet and have my charger with me. But I do know that I can easily get through at least 4 hours of regular use without plugging in. I though low battery life would be much more of an issue that it ended up being, and overall I'm happy with this.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Temperatures were normal and the computer just randomly crashed and then could never post.In order to attempt to fix this on my own I went to take out the battery for 10 seconds. However, the battery casing is very poorly design--its placed inside the case!! Its not like the hp laptops where you can just swap it out easily by pushing a button. No, you have to remove a good 12 screws and take off the bottom panel just to remove the battery. I also sliced open my finger trying to undo all of the annoying latches without breaking the flimsy bottom panel. Oh, and by the way, it took me 10 minutes to realize that there was another screw hidden under the dumb factory seal label!!!! Very annoying and frustrating since it was very stealthily hidden. Lastly, you'll want to make sure you're very gentle when removing the case because it would be very easy to break off the little plastic latches that snap the bottom panel on.Currently put a support ticket into MSI and fortunately I'm within warranty, so I will update this depending on their responsiveness and ability to get my laptop working.So far im very disappointed, but I understand that electronics sometimes have flaws because of the laws of probability, and it may have actually been nvidia's or intel's fault, so I will revert this to 4 stars if MSI solves my problem. It would be 5 stars if the battery wasn't behind the bottom panel.UPDATE:MSI's RMA process was excellent. They did a very professional repair, it looks brand new and runs well. I was worried that they might mess up the thermal paste after putting in a new mobo, but it appears. Apparently there was a crack in the chassis that I did not even know about and they replaced and fixed it to without me even mentioning it! They've done right by me and I am impressed. I would give this 5 stars, but its not quite perfect due to the fact that the battery is on the inside and you have to remove 12 screws to get to hit. Besides that however this is an excellent product. I'll update if this dies again but MSI RMA service was fast and beyond expectation. Including shipping, receiving, them having to get new parts, and them fix it, it only took 2 weeks, and they rushed it so that I could get it before my trip. You won't be dissatisfied with the RMA service if you need it, so you can probably trust that MSI will do right by you. Thumbs up MSI.

(For me it was enough to run Lumion 3D without issues and it never exceeded 4GB)- My unit has high pitched fans so it's loud under load.Tips to reduce your CPU and GPU temperatures on the laptop:1- Have the back of your laptop raised by few centimeters to allow more air into the vents. (3 to 5c lower temps)2- Play on balanced mode instead of Performance, you will get lower temps (by up to 10c) and not much performance is lost (5% to 10% at worst, at least that's what i saw with my games.)3- Disable boost, this had minor impact on my fps but i had cooler temps on my ryzen 5800h temps (14c lower temps).To disable boost follow steps below:\u2013 Run cmd as administrator and type in:powercfg -attributes sub_processor perfboostmode -attrib_hideThis will reveal a setting \"Processor performance boost mode\" in the advanced options in your power plan settings that lets you enable or disable boost.\u2013 If you want to Undo the previous operationpowercfg -attributes sub_processor perfboostmode +attrib_hide\u2013 Configure it in your preferred power plan:Control Panel/Power Options/Change Plan Settings/Change advanced power settings/Processor power management/Processor performance boost modeWhile Disabled (Default: Aggressive) your thermals will improve drastically with minimal or zero performance lost depending on the game.If you don't want to completely disable it use Efficient Aggressive.Note that disabling boost reduces performance when doing demanding non-gaming workloads like rendering (mostly CPU workloads), so disable it if you want max performance at the cost of more heat.[Review updated with pictures showing temperature improvements for both CPU (Ryzen 7 5800H) and GPU (3050TI) using the tips above running Monster Hunter Rise]", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

The speakers are really sub-par (minus one star for this). My iPhone XS Max is a couple orders of magnitude louder. I like to bring my laptop everywhere I go. But the XPS 13 speaker is so underpowered that YouTube videos are sometimes barely audible at max volume. I also like to listen to things while I prepare food and do other activities, but it's impossible through the built-in speakers, and I've gotten in the habit of carrying around a portable Bluetooth speaker along with the laptop everywhere I go.2. The trackpad is poor quality. It has a cheap feel to it, and over time it has become unreliable at registering clicks (it's fine with taps, but fully depressed clicks fail to register about 50% of the time). Sometimes I use the laptop in bed, and often the trackpad makes a noticeable rattling sound when I click the trackpad, and it also rattles when I type.3. At high CPU sometimes the fan rattles as well, and sometimes causes the case to rattle.4. Nose+hands cam. The web cam is high quality, but is located at such a weird angle that I've come to use other devices for video conferencing. No one wants to see my supersized fingers typing in the foreground while they're trying to talk to me. I understand that at least this has been addressed in more recent models.4. InfinityEdge display + touchscreen = annoying to handle. It's so hard to pick up the laptop when even brushing the side of it causes it to register a click. I didn't order the touch screen, but got one anyway!

My laptop that I upgraded from win8 to win10 had a defective hard drive, and rather than going through the process all over again (I didn't get a chance to create installation media before I had to revert it), I decided to get something new.It's a slick laptop that has the appearance of a macbook. I've seen reviews describing the color as more silver than gold and yeah, that would be correct. In the light it definitely has a gold tint but otherwise it's very brushed silver. No CD drive, so I'll unfortunately have to purchase an external, but it's lightweight and compact - it goes into my luggage easily when I travel. Keyboard is super nice with chicklet-style keys that are easy to handle. Booting is SUPER fast and I love the Windows Hello feature to sign in - although you really do have to work to train the computer to recognize your fingers. It takes awhile to get used to but I find it to be a really nice addition.I'm very happy about the SSD drive, since my past computers have been HDDs. However, I'm not sure if the SSD drive is making a sound or if there's a fan, but there's DEFINITELY a noise coming from this computer. It sounds like a drive or a fan constantly restarting. I can't describe the sound but you can definitely hear it and it's noticeable. It sounds like a drive constantly booting up and restarting. Or it might be the fan. I'm not sure if it's something to worry about, but I will keep an eye on it.Other than that, the display is not fantastic. The screen is very nice, but I'm an artist and I draw with a tablet, and I find the colors to be lighter than they actually are when I save my work and export it. Also, I've had to squint at the screen/tilt the screen to see what I'm looking at. Might just be my bad eyes, though.Anyway, I'm happy with this computer. Asus has made a ton of improvements since the last two laptops I've had from them, both in software and hardware (my other two laptops came with Windows 8 - Windows 10 is a vast improvement).

The Chromebook's processor and RAM appears more than enough to handle the streaming video and multiple applications open at once.The only reason for 4 stars is that the unit we purchased had a failing WIFI part.

There's nothing close to this price with this CPU and GPU. The screen is vivid and sharp. As a bonus, the keyboard has good response to it when typing and I like the color customization to the color of the keyboard keys. I also like the fan speed option because it is pretty loud when turned up but I was really impressed the silent mode option which keeps the laptop quiet for the operations I have used it with (surfing, videos, games (Sim, RTS, Strat, MMO, RPG, but not FPS). In addition to the 3 usb ports, there is 1 USB C port as well which is a need for me. Keep in mind that on this laptop, the fan vents blow out in the rear left and right and also the back left side as well so keep those area clear. The AC plug is located in the middle of the right side which some may not like , but it doesn't bother me one bit.

I called Olive Computers prior to purchasing to confirm the one they were selling had all those features. They did have one and made sure that was the model I received. I recommend calling them prior to purchase if you have specific requirements such as mine.A couple of reasons why I didn't give a 5-star review.1. The protective lens for the webcam was cloudy. I did contact Olive computers and they replied quickly with a fix. Even though I cleaned the lens from the front, it needed to be cleaned from the back. Thankfully I am somewhat technically inclined but I think almost anyone could have fixed this specific issue.2. The Laptop works great and arrived in decent condition but you can tell it is used with some minor scuff marks.Overall I am pleased with my purchase and plan to keep this laptop as it offers everything I specifically looked for a fair price.

I never really noticed it before but I think after upgrading it to Windows 11, the fan runs louder more regularly.2/1/2021 Update: This laptop is easily upgradeable, which is a huge plus. I swapped out the NVME M.2 SSD with a 1TB. This model, the AN515-54, has two M.2 slots plus a spot for a 2.5\" SSD drive. So in theory you can have three storage drives installed. Both M.2 slots accept NVME but only one can read SATA. I also add an additional 8GB RAM to make the total 16GB. It was really easy to do and even if you're not with computers, you can easily figure it out by watching a tutorial on YouTube.Original Review: I had very low expectations for this laptop and I was actually pleasantly surprised by how great the build quality of the laptop was. I forgot how great Acer laptops are. This laptop is no desktop replacement but it's definitely good enough to play most games. I ran 3DMark on it and it scored 3548, which is decent for the price of the computer. WIth that score, you will be able to play most games although not at its highest settings. Overall I recommend it and I'll be using this for years to come.Pros:- Great value and the build quality is excellent. I especially love the keyboard and how the laptop lid opens and closes. It just feels really nice.- The keyboard is excellent. Great travel and it's full-sized.Cons:- Comes with a bunch of bloatware to include Norton, Dropbox, Firefox (I actually prefer it but it does come preinstalled), Spotify, Netflix, ExpressVPN, and probably a bunch more that I'm missing.- It's hard to insert the power cable into the computer for some reason. Not really hard but definitely harder than it needs to be. Maybe I just haven't figured out how to do it properly.- I got around 4-5 hours of battery life.

However if you are using an external 4k monitor then you can get more performance.Summary:On the last note, everything looks and plays just great on the built-in screen.

I bought this computer primarily as a back up that I could use for 3d CAD programs such as SolidWorks. Computer ran great for a few months then stopped loading the system software. First appearance was that it was a BIOS issue but it wasn't. At this point it had only been used between 10-20 hours and it was set aside and nearly forgotten about.Final verdict was it had to go back to Asus. While there I was treated with a disregard I've only found in people who can not communicate in English. After they had the computer several weeks they contacted me stating the repair would cost nearly $500. That was argued and they did the repair for free, replacing the motherboard and the hard drive as they were both faulty. That repair took another almost 6 weeks.Received the computer back and needed to reformat the thing because Asus left their own profiles and admin lockout on the system. When they were contacted again they stated that they received the laptop with scratches all over the top, bottom, and screen. That was a pure lie, I can take photos of it now and prove that there are no scratches anywhere in the computer.Also when it was shipped back from Asus they packages it in such a half a$$ed manner that I was amazed it wasn't destroyed. They stated to ship to them with 2 inches of padding/packing in all sides. What they shipped back was maybe \u00bd\" of foam, less than adequate.I wish I'd paid more attention because if I'd dealt with it immediately I could have returned to the seller for a refund.

Last MSI product I'll ever buy, and they used to be my preference for Motherboard and Video Card purchases.EDIT 2 1/1/2019: Just got it back from a *2nd* RMA... came back saying \"Customer problem, reinstall OS\" which they already did.. and I had already done at the direction of their tech support. Oh, and the problems still persist.Edit 3 4/5/2019: So this laptop has now been sent back to the manufacturer 4 times. It came back from the manufacturer in \"working condition\" but experiences: BSOD related to bad driver installation, constant freezing (likely due to said driver).. a factory image does nothing. The Windows image is botched so it will not take a direct install of DirectX drivers, requiring workarounds just to install it. There is also a permanent \"smudge\" underneath the glass within the screen on the left third. While games no longer randomly force close, now, the entire laptop just freezes up.

Core i3 1005G1, 128GB NVME SSD and 8GB RAM. It feels very snappy and responsive. The fingerprint logon is super fast and is one of the reasons I got it over the cheaper Acer. I got this for my wife as she only needs the most basic specs but I did not want to settle for anything less than a 10th generation Intl Core or 4000 series AMD Ryzen. I really would not change a thing about it for the price except that it should have had 250GB to 500GB of storage. The OEM is only paying $20 for the Hynix SSD they could have invested $10 more for a larger SSD. My laptop has 32GB of RAM but 8GB in this laptop does not feel slow at all. No bloatware from Asus at all. Office365 being pre-installed in three separate languages is unforgiveable by Microsoft. And why does it take 7 minutes to uninstall each language? Are they hoping you lose patience and give up the install so it can keep pestering you? Windows S Mode is annoying and disabling it is the only reason I had to help my wife set up this laptop. Although Windows S mode might be the reason it has so little bloatware installed.Pros: Ports! Wow it so nice to have 4 USB ports and one of them being USB-C; NVME SSD; 1920x1080 display with decent brightness. Core i3 super responsive. Light weight and slim. Thin bevels. Very premium feeling plastic case like it better than the aluminum HP Envy it replaced and is far lighter. Excellent keyboard and track pad.Cons: No RJ45 wired LAN. For the price it exceeds my exceptions in everything except storage. 128GB is on the small side. I would rather upgrade the the storage later than buy something else with a larger drive. LCD could use darker, blacks, but that is a picking at a small detail at this price point. The viewing angles are on the poorer side but I don't care about that and neither does my wife.Update 2020/10/15Was getting long stutters running Zoom Video Conferencing and Google Sheets in the FireFox browser. System resource meter showed Memory utilization at 70% and CPU at 50%. 70% memory usage istto much and it means it was hitting the SSD for pagefile swapping. I had a stick of 8GB DDR-4 2666 laying around so I replaced the 4GB DDR-4 3200 to upgrade it to a total of 12GB RAM. (See included photos) That did the trick. Memory utilization is now 50% for same workload.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

They replaced the main board and the computer seems to be working fine. Credit here to Dell for standing behind their product.But going through the diagnosis and repair is a pain. The technical support people wanted to eliminate all the software possibilities so we kept trying things including a clean re-install of Windows - which wiped my machine.After we eliminated all the software possibilities, Dell sent me a box and I shipped it back to them on a Tuesday. I received the unit back on the following Wednesday.But this is all things that shouldn't have happened. The computer should have operated properly when I received it. Perhaps it was defective and was not refurbished properly. It would have been worth a few extra dollars to avoid all of this service headache.Note that this is not a ding on Dell but on the company who claimed to refurbish the computer. Dell stepped up and fixed the unit.+++++++++++++++++++[Update] I'm experiencing a problem with this computer in that it gives a Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD) occasionally. It recovers from the BSOD and goes back to normal operation. I'm working with Dell now to find a solution. They believe it's a software problem but if that were correct, it seems that everyone would be having the BSOD problem. I'll post a follow-up after I work with Dell some more. Really disappointing. I've never had a computer that was this unreliable.++++++++++++++I've only had the computer for a couple of days - it's a refurb unit. The computer was clean and unmarked - looked like new. Setup was normal and the unit functions like I'd expect a new computer to function.It was packed well and was shipped quickly. Not much else to say - I'll have to wait until I have more time with it to see if any problems crop up. I thought the price was fair considering it has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. I'll probably have to upgrade it to a 1TB SSD at some point in the future - I checked the maintenance manual and an upgrade looks pretty easy.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Overall processing and gaming out of the box very nice.Cons: Battery life is shit, laptop isn't designed for that. Fans are loud especially under load, also, that's kind of the point in running this type of GPU. The keyboard layout isn't quite default, to get proper spacing for most keys they moved around FN / Windows keys a bit / DEL. Not the worst being you don't use them as often but can be awkward. Some of the finish on the laptop is nice and metal / brushed / polished, while other pieces are boring easily breakable plastic if the laptop took a drop or was opened incorrectly. There is also a decent amount of bloatware on fresh open, some of it you'll keep im sure but can be a bit annoying if you're not windows savvy.Overall gets a 5/5 don't let me blabbing fool you, this is a 1080p powerhouse.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Doing a powerwash will sometimes resolve the problem, but most often I have episodes like this until I guess the \"fixer update\" is pushed out. Around 3 or 4 months ago, my chromebook stop connecting to the Google Play Store and I could not download apps that were previously installed on my chromebook before i had to do a powerwash because of the constant restarting.

The RGB keyboard keys can be individually set for different colors. I still can't figure out why the discrete RTX2070 is always on for some reasons. The power button on mine is always Orange (on GPU RTX2070). This probably explains why I'm only getting like 1 hour and 15 minutes instead of 2-3 hours while watching youtube.

RTX 2070 and \"budget\" don't usually belong in the same product description. Somehow, MSI made it work with a super powerful gaming machine that kicks ass and. Well, for the budget-oriented high-end gamer, this is all you ever need.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014PERFORMANCE - 5,555/5This is not something you need worry about on this laptop. This machine pulls 100+ the most AAA demanding titles at the highest settings, thanks to the full RTX 2070 mobile GPU (not Max-Q).My Frames in some FPS games (high/ultra settings, 1080p):Warzone: 90s-120sPlanetside 2: 140s (VR training), 60s-80s (huge fights)Apex Legends: 90-100sThe main performance \"bottleneck\" is the i7-10750h CPU, which is obvious when comparing with the stupidly powerful RTX 2070 graphics card. Also makes sense since the CPU hits the 90+ C while GPU hits 70s. That being said, hitting the above framerates in games, I can\u2019t complain.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014THERMALS - 4/5Totally competent. Runs a little hotter than I hoped for, but won't thermal throttle out of the box (default \u201cUser\u201d mode in Dragon center with high CPU, auto fans).Undervolting with XTU can be unlocked in the Advanced BIOS settings. I played around with some sliders, but I couldn\u2019t get better performance than stock settings. YMMV.The fans are LOUD. When gaming, air blasts out the back and right side. Hot air blasts out the left side. Don\u2019t leave any accessories to bake next to this laptop, and you\u2019ll be fine. Thankfully, the keyboard stays cool and comfortable during long gaming sessions.I give 4/5 because it\u2019s not something you\u2019d really notice.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014SCREEN - 5/5Tech reviewers give the response time as 5 ms, close to the advertised 3 ms. Without a way to test for it myself, I\u2019d trust this figure.144 hz refresh rate is buttery smooth to the eye and more than good enough for FPS and action games. The screen is has deep contrast, though it seems biased towards darker colors. Full brightness may hurt your eyes though.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014BUILD QUALITY/AESTHETICS - 4/5Impressive for the budget. Very thin screen bezels. Almost all metal except for the bottom panel. (But the screen does flex a little bit).It\u2019s not the thinnest or prettiest laptop, but you won\u2019t have to worry about people judging you outside. You won\u2019t be bringing this outside! (with a weight of 9 pounds!). All in all, this laptop might be most portable desktop I ever had.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014KEYBOARD - 5/5Unfortunately, compromises had to be made to fit a keyboard and numpad under a 15.6\u201d size screen. The keyboard is slightly smaller than full size (but it\u2019s easy to get used to).The keys feel pleasantly precise and have a decent amount of travel.All complaints are automatically nullified when you turn on the laptop.

The trackpad goes back to the old days when we had physical click and right click buttons. I would have preferred if the.

HDMI, separate audio in/audio out, USB-C, 3x USB 3, SD card slot, ethernet, mini Displayport. Charging port on the right side.I would have preferred the ports to be on the back (would help clean up the cables a but), but it\u2019s not something you notice while gaming.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014SPEAKERS - use headphonesThey\u2019re pretty bad, but who cares?", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Many times when I go to delete something, I hit the power button.

I had read other reviews stating that the screen was not great, but overall OK. I would say that the screen is sub-par. There is a significant amount of light bleed, and the viewing angles are pretty bad. I knew this was not an IPS screen, but having worked on other LCD screens, this one seemed even more difficult to look at. The specs were good for the price point, and the build was average, but the poor quality screen was a deal breaker.

I have been looking for an MS alternative for a while as the issues and maintenance of a MS PC have grown old. I wanted an easy to use and maintain system that was inexpensive but still fast to boot up and use. The Chromebook fit all of those requirements nicely. The setup of this system was very easy and the interface isn't that different from an Android phone. It didn't take long at all to figure out where everything was located and so far the system has worked flawlessly. The battery life is great and the 15.6\" screen is the same size as the older laptop that it replaced. I was able to show my non-PC savvy wife how to use this system without any problems. The hardware is more than capable of running the Chrome OS and there are plenty of apps available to do just about anything that you could want to do. The only shortfall would be if you require a specific software that will only run on a MS PC then this system would not work for you. For the vast majority of users this system will work fine. I have a relative who purchased an expensive MacBook and this Chromebook is very comparable to that system at less than 1/3 of the cost.

This POS can't even do that properly. RAM runs at 100% while idle because 4gb is barely enough for just the operating system to function, and just having chrome open is enough to push the CPU to 100% as well, so doing nearly anything is extremely slow. Screen is 1080p but the quality is not great. I don't know what super geniuses thought to put the cooling fan in front of the keyboard instead of on the side, but it makes it sound like a tornado whenever it is doing anything at all, even idling. Oh and also if this thing is anywhere near you while you are sleeping, be ready for the fans to rev up to max randomly, out of nowhere, while it's in sleep mode and wake you up, for no reason. Sound is also very quiet, you need to crank it up to 50/60 to hear pretty much anything.I haven't bought a laptop in a few years and I thought even cheap laptops would be able to deliver on basic functionality, but boy was I wrong.

The limitation of the Iphone for some advanced features (like dual SIM and the possibility to flash OS images from a ssd) and the need to use bootcamp in the Mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computer.I had a Samsung s10+ and a Huawei Matebook pro with windows and linux. Both devices are impeccable. Really made my work easier in so many aspects. But as time passed my life wasn't getting simpler like it was with my Iphone and my Mac.Apple products work flawlessly between each other and there are always new implementations that simplifies everyday life. Quality of this products and its software is incredible. Although other products have better capabilities ( for example my Matebook outperforms this MacBook Air m1 and has a much better quality screen) they lack the simplicity and stability.Being all this said, The MacBook Air M1 is a really great laptop. The most basic version which is the one I bought is blazing fast, stable and with a great battery life (much better than the Huawei Matebook pro). Also its absolute silent and fresh. Its doesn't get hot at all.To make my work easier I had to pay for some software that saddly I was denied to pay on the Mac at the beginning. Apple products are expensive but I've learned that in the long run they are worth it. Life is about time and how you spend it and apple definitely focus its effort to simplify the time you use to do a task.I wanted to share my story in case you are in a situation like I had. If you have an iPhone and other Apple products don't doubt. Buy a Macbook Air M1. I still have a beefy windows machine for gaming, rendering, and other things.

I'm sure it will be on AMZ soon... so for the Always Connected crowd: the XE525 model is THE chromebook to buy. Moreover, it is unlocked, so Google Fi works:1. Remove VzW SIM card2. Insert Google Fi SIM card3. Power up4. Settings | Network | Mobile Data: On5. Tap Mobile Data | Home Provider Name: Google Fi6. Access Point Name: h2g2 (should already by populated, drop-down menu)7. Save8. Close Settings If SIM setup is successful, you\u2019ll see \"Google Fi\" at the top of your screen. (Might see \"T-Mobile\" or \"Project Fi\".)Some significant pluses over other Chromebooks: More ports, esp. 2 x USB-C, and under Settings | Power, you can keep the display on (no timeout) on AC power.I use an ASUS MB169C external monitor with my XE525 (language translation work).Would I like to have the M3 CPU rather than the Celeron? Yes, but rarely would I use the extra MIPS.Would I like to have the 3K x 2K panel of the previous Chromebook (XE513)? Actually, no, because that would mean dealing with very small text in some Android apps that don't scale. In any event, with 2 external 15.6\" panels, I have plenty of desktop.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

My old macbook air, smoked this one. I never got booted off of wifi with my old one. I sure hope they have an update that fixes this issue.

It has been great so far!-The battery life is exceptional - if I'm not running any games or any other intense software, it can run all day at work without needing a charger. This has gone down slightly since I bought it though.-Super slim and light. I carry it with me almost everywhere and it takes up barely any room in my backpack. I can carry it by itself easily as well.-Screen is matte, not glossy. I like this because it means I don't get a bunch of glare when I'm outside.-I can run jobs in RStudio pretty easily on this without needing to connect to an external server.-I can play a few games on this laptop, mostly The Sims and Stardew Valley. The graphics aren't exceptional by any means but I'm able to run these games without lag.-The only downside is the lack of ports - which comes with the slim profile. It only has 2 USB, 1 USB-C, one micro-HDMI, and one SD slot, so I've had to buy a lot of adapters and can't have them all in at the same time.-The fingerprint reader is convenient but sometimes it doesn't work for no apparent reason.Overall, for the price I think this is a great buy, if you don't need a machine that runs intense games or fancy software. Highly recommend for college students or anyone who needs to take their laptops on the go.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Compared to my desktop i7-7820X, this i7-11800H is 25% faster, but the difference is in the NVidia Geforce RTX 3070 video card, it is 4 times faster than my desktop NVidia Geforce RTX 1660. I can work on it 8K videos in DaVinci Resolve 17 without any problem and animate in Fusion easily due to its 8 GB of VRAM. The prices of electronic products are going up, so I decided to buy it now before the prices go up any more.Another advantage of this laptop is its aluminum chassis, which unlike my previous laptops, is very strong and feels sturdy. The mechanical keyboard is very good and the battery life of about 4 hours is relatively acceptable for a laptop with that much power. My previous gaming laptop had a battery life of 1.5 hours.What I don't like is that it only has two M.2 bays and that the fans make too much noise if I use it in the most powerful mode.Otherwise, it is an excellent purchase.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Still would recommend.The i7-7700HQ + 16gb 2400MHz RAM + an SSD makes for a very fast and capable laptop. The 1TB HDD is good for backup, though I would just swap it for another SSD. Bottom line, laptops aren't the best gaming rigs because of low power and the heat it generates, so a GTX 1050 with 4gb VRAM is a really solid option. It can play most games quite well!A few things to note:- The \"aluminum chassis\" has an odd feel. It feels like a metal/plastic mix, but it is still very nice and satisfied my need for a sleek aluminum laptop.- The screen is great only if you are looking at the right angle. It's a beautiful 1080p, but if you change positions, you'll have to adjust the screen to get that good viewing angle again.- The laptop is not loud by any means, but my CPU fan seems to spin at a constant, high speed. Not sure if it's quality control or what, but it is something I noticed (that I don't mind btw)- The charging block is pretty huge.Overall, I would definitely recommend it.

I use Ableton for Music Production and require a laptop that can process tons of different moving parts at the same time. Ableton is running better than ever on this, I haven't had any CPU crashes or overloads whatsoever. The only reason this isn't the perfect laptop for me is the speaker. The laptop's speaker quality is very mediocre. Granted, the laptop audio quality is stellar. When plugged into headphones or other speakers, it sounds great.

My current primary laptop is a MacBook Pro, but I also have 2 other Macs and 4 other Windows computers. I remember back when IBM sold their PC division to Lenovo. I was worried that the quality of the laptops would suffer compared to the ones IBM used to sell, but Lenovo has done a great job of maintaining that quality, especially in their ThinkPad line.I still prefer AlienWare for gaming laptops, but after using this Legion 5 for a while, I would say that Lenovo would be my second choice. The specs that you get for the price are a great value. Even if you are not a gamer, this laptop could serve as a desktop replacement. It has 16GB of RAM (upgradeable to 32GB), a fast 512GB SSD (You can either replace the stock SSD or add a 2nd one internally), an 8-core Ryzen 7 4800H CPU, and an Nvidia GTX 1660Ti GPU. It's not the fastest gaming laptop, of course, but it can handle most games just fine as well as VR headsets.The only negative I have discovered (as others have mentioned) is the battery life. This particular model comes with a 60-watt battery, which doesn't last very long under normal use. 2-4 hours is the average for me. I'm used to getting 8 hours or more with my MacBook Pro, but given the extra load that the GPU puts on the battery, I can understand this. Most people will be using this laptop while it is plugged in anyway. But if you really need long battery life on a gaming laptop, I would suggest looking elsewhere. But otherwise this is one of the best values you will find for a laptop with these specs.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I searched for laptop deals for about a month before finding this one, which blew my expectations for the price point out of the water, and it is quite a monster laptop with its GPU+CPU combo.My favorite small feature is the individually lit LED keys with the physical laptop button to customize/change it! Any negatives of this laptop do not bother me at all, which is why I am extremely happy with my purchase. Here's a short list of the main pros and cons of the laptop:----------------------CONS:* Short Battery life. Don't expect to use this laptop to any serious capacity without being plugged in; that's the main trade-off of gaming laptops. It still has the portability of a laptop, and I still can and have used it for a couple of hours at a time unplugged (after dark living with an off-grid solar power system), but this thing is a beast. It will not be able to perform at full power without being plugged in, but you're not going to be gaming on your lap with this thing anyway.* Subpar onboard speakers/microphone/webcam. The speakers on the laptop aren't great, and the microphone isn't anything special, but both are functional if you don't want to buy a mic or use headphones for a bit. Once again, though, if you're using a gaming laptop, you are probably going to have your accessories (headphones/headset, mic, mouse+mousepad), so it really only affects you if you plan on watching movies with this laptop without an external speaker.Though I think even having a webcam is nice, so the quality (iirc it's 720p) doesn't bother me much cause it's better than not having one.---------------------PROS:* The best and most reliable laptop specs for the price point. This has an RTX 2070, beautiful 144hz 1080p low delay screen, i7-10750H CPU, 8GB RAM (which can be upgraded), and a 512GB SSD (which also can be upgraded). This thing works well on any game you throw at it, and it is only barely over-preformed by maxed out desktop setups and laptops that cost 1.5x-2x as much. I researched laptops for at least a month to try to find the best deal and not waste my money, and when I bought it on sale for $1400 upon release, it was literally an instant buy because of its specs alone. I have had no problems running games or Adobe programs on it.* Along with the last one, the screen is very nice. There isn't a thick border to the edge of the laptop, and it feels very sturdy at every point of rotation along the hinge. I came from a 17\" MSI to this 15\" one and thought it would be hard to go down in the screen size, but it wasn't at all; if anything, the laptop size is more convenient.* The cooling is pretty great. While monitoring the laptop temperature, I haven't had any noticeable overheating problems playing intensive games on a hot summer day, and if you think you need it, you can max out the fans with a physical button on the laptop. The fans are loud, but they don't bother me at all having headphones on. Things to the left side vent of the laptop do get a bit warm, but that's how you know the cooling system is working.* For me, the keyboard is quite satisfying in every way. It is nice to type on it, I like the font of the letters, it still has a numpad and arrow keys, and the LED key lights are mesmerizing.-----------", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

The GTX 1050 inside do wonders when it comes to graphic demanding tasks like games. GTA V can be ran smoothly on this at about 60 FPS on high settings.

Dunno if this is configurable but I couldn't find any obvious solution. Other than that, its an amazing laptop, I specially love the screen on this one. Keyboard is a little stiff, and needs some getting-used-to when gaming. I personally have a half-keyboard that I use with anything I game on (see attached photo), so that's not a big issue for me. Also, If you're looking for a laptop bag for this one, you should get an 18 inch bag, because this is quite large for a 17.3 inch laptop. The fan can get a little loud when gaming but not to the point where its annoying. I personally love the overall build quality of the laptop, and if it weren't for that FPS drop when running on battery, I'd definitely give this a 5/5. It comes with a 1TB WD blue hard drive, which I instantly switched with a Samsung SSD, no issues there.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I'm telling you now that you will not regret it. Trust me when I say that I did so much research on Chromebooks before buying this laptop and it was so hard for me to decide. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to do much on the chromebook. I had an HP Envy dv6 running Windows 10 before I purchased the HP Chromebook 14. It was 15.6 inches and heavy, so I avoided taking it to school at all costs. I'm a college student and finals week is coming up, and I really wanted a light laptop I could carry in my backpack. After hours of looking into Chrome OS, I gave in and bought the HP Chromebook 14 (the 4gb one). It arrived safely and on time. As soon as I powered the laptop on, the chrome logo came up and all I had to do was sign into my Google account and everything was set up already. This laptop is beautiful. I purchased the silver one, and if I want to add some color, I'll probably just purchase some skins later on.I usually use my laptop to video stream, web browse, and create/edit Word documents. I've been using this chromebook for a few days already and I have had no problems at all. Youtube, Netflix, and Hulu run very smoothly. The screen resolution is 1920x1080 HD and it looks absolutely beautiful. The screen is a matte finish which prevents glaring if you're in the sunlight. I have no complaints at all about the screen. The brightness is amazing. Absolutely no complaints here.Web browsing on Chrome is very smooth. It's the only browser I have used on all computers I come across. All my bookmarks are there and I'm used to how it works, so it's very easy for me to manage my chromebook. I was worried my chromebook wouldn't read my USB flash drive, which is where all my homework and school stuff is saved on. I plugged it into the laptop, and it popped up in the \"Files\" folder. Everything ran smoothly. I can create and edit my homework documents through the Chrome Microsoft Word Extension. Everything saves automatically. If you don't like using the Word extension, you can also use Google Docs. I'm just used to Word and it's what I feel most comfortable with.I don't own an iPhone, but I do have an iPad mini. However, I don't really need to plug my iPad to a computer for anything, so I wasn't worried about the fact that Chrome OS doesn't support iTunes. I have a Samsung Note 4 and I was concerned that my chromebook wouldn't recognize it via USB. It didn't work on the USB ports on the left side of the laptop, but it did work on one USB port that's on the right. I found out that's the one for data transferring (USB 3.0). I can transfer files from my Note 4 to my Chromebook without a problem.I have had a pleasant experience with my HP Chromebook 14 these past few days. It's really good for multitasking. I'm currently writing this review while Pretty Little Liars is playing on Netflix in another window (No lagging :)). I forgot to mention the battery life is great! I used it a whole day without having to plug it in! Definitely a plus. The only negative thing I can say is that there is no backlit keyboard. My old laptop didn't have one either, but it doesn't really bother me because I'm used to it. I'm very happy with my Chromebook. I just bought a case and it's arriving in 2 days. I can do homework and watch Jane The Virgin, and I'm okay with that! I definitely recommend this Chromebook if you are like me and are looking for a laptop that can do basic things like web browsing, video streaming, and homework all at the same time.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

That concerns me for long term use. Also expected a C-type charger but got a 3 prong round plug in which I dislike. Why HP, why?

Top heavy screen makes for unbalanced and awkward use on knees/lap. Exaggerated battery life in the on-line description. Bluetooth and WiFi are solid.

It's good that a conversion to Windows 10 Home can be easily performed.The sound incredibly weak. Even my Android phone's sound has better volume. Even at full volume, the speakers (located on the underside of the bottom case) lack volume.

I had bought a chromebook 11 in 2016 for about the same price, and it was fantastic. Incredibly fast, great memory storage, super durable, and cheap. so I hoped to get a similar experience from this product.It has been a disappointment since the very first time I opened it. Not only is windows 10 the worst platform ever, it is incredibly restrictive. Something called \"Microsoft smart screen\" prevents you from downloading any plug ins or apps on the computer that are not from the Microsoft store. This means you are only capable of using Bing as an internet explorer. I have explored every option to remove Microsoft smart screen, which is literally impossible. Not even online live Microsoft support could fix my problem. It crashes almost every time I use it. I cannot even play music in one tab and browse the internet on the other without it making this computer incredibly slow. It has practically zero storage space. It can't even connect to the internet half the time. This computer is a waste of atoms and materials on our earth. I wish desperately I could have my money back. This computer has been a failure of a product ever since I first turned it on. I hope no one makes the mistake I did by wasting my precious STUDENT MONEY on a product that is worthless.

It is a good middle of the road laptop. It is light and slim which makes it great for traveling and working online.Pros:- Very light and portable but doesn't feel chintzy. It seems to be constructed well.-The i5 does pretty well. The onboard graphics will bottleneck in certain situations, though, I have only encountered this when gaming.-As just mentioned this will handle light gaming. I play Skyrim with medium settings and have good framerate any more than that and it will bog down. I was able to play overwatch as well but had to do a lot of fiddling with the graphics to get it to run smooth.-This is my first computer with an SSD and I love them. From the time you push power, you can be opening your web browser in 15 seconds. It also helps with the dreaded windows update. It takes SIGNIFICANTLY less time to update.-The harman/kardon speakers are great they have a good sound quality for a laptop speaker and are plenty loud.-The battery life is very good. It will stay charged for 5 or 6 hours while gaming while connected to the internet and full brightness. Essentially, you will have 5 to 6 hours of battery at the least. You can get at least 12 hours with light use.-A common complaint about this laptop is a loud fan. I haven't experienced this at all. Mine is very quiet and works well.- I use it for photo editing via lightroom and it does well.Cons:-The screen doesn't have a wide range of motion. It probably only goes to 100 degrees or so.-As I said you can do light gaming with this but if you a really into gaming and want to play with high settings this isn't for you.Overall this laptop is great for work a little above your typical internet streaming and word processing.

Its dedicated graphics, and powerful multicore processor make it is so perfectly suited to my needs.The screen, with its weak viewing angle, is less than astonishing. I seem to want to move my head around when I try to take in the entire image on the screen. It is a sufficient enough monitor to get by with when away from a more significant monitor at home.This is my first laptop with a backlit keyboard. I love that I can get an at-a-glance overview of special keyboard function locations, as I find myself computing in low light, often. It\u2019s just so awesome when lit up, and the lighting level is adjustable, for subtle lighting, as desired.I had my reservations about the lack of an optical drive, but I hot over that quickly; I borrowed the optical drive of an older laptop over my home network to install all of my software, and now I\u2019m good to go with am ultra lightweight, ultra portable computing powerhouse. It\u2019s quite luxurious, the lack of bulk.I have all the power I need with my Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM configuration. No practical computing task is beyond my capability.This machine games beautifully. The GeForce 1050 may be a few generations wise, but it plays current 3D titles with ease. It will handle anything I plan to throw at a laptop. I get the most responsive video editing power I\u2019ve had to date, with smooth scrub navigation, and speedy rendering. And photo editing packages take full advantage of the VivoBook Pro\u2019s remarkable computing power.I just love my Asus VivoBook Pro! The amazing set of built in convenience functions on backlit keyboard, the powerful multicore processor, the dedicated graphics power. Its high quality, kicking Harman Kardon audio is but icing on the cake, offering exceptional audio for an intense gaming experience.I have given several different laptop brands a chance over the years, and I must note that this Asus VivoBook Pro is my most enjoyable yet. The last time I loved a laptop this much was when dedicated graphics in the two-digit megabyte range was a big deal. So far, I am so enthusiastic about working on this laptop computer, because all of its capabilities, coupled with its sleek, gorgeous design, makes working on the Asus VivoBook Pro an absolute pleasure.

True its not my main computer for Photoshop but still gets its share of use with no problems.(Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-36UT Slim Laptop | 15.6\" Full HD Display | 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor | 4GB DDR4 | 128GB NVMe SSD | WiFi 6 | Amazon Alexa | Windows 10 Home (S Mode)For a computer of this size and configuration it is an amazing unit with speed and versatility I would not have expected. Topping that off is a second drive bay which will take a HDD or SSD drive up to 2Tb and even upgrade the existing 128 GB M2 can be swapped out for larger main C Drive. It also has a slot to add another stick of ram. As a 15 inch the computer is quite light and thin making it easy to carry around. There are four USB (one USB C, one USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0) along with a HDMA and headphone outputs. And of course its got Alexa!With an Intel I3 running at over four GHz it is very fast and booting up I clocked at 12.5 seconds after a five second hold on the start button. I do photoshop and video so made a test comparing it with my main work computer to render a 25 image 2.55 minute video slideshow with music with all images in the 10 to 20 MB range. My bench mark has Intel I5 and a dedicated Gforce graphic processor.Results: my benchmark rendered the video in 59.8 seconds. This Acer came in very well at 1:16.3 minute which is remarkable considering the price difference of my benchmark. Doing light to medium video and photo touch up this will be more than up to the task.One important thing to note is that this comes set up in Windows 10 \u201cS\u201d mode which can be changed. S mode is set up as a more secure PC by limiting all apps to what is in the Microsoft Store. What this means is you are locked in to the EDGE browser, non Microsoft photo editors or music players for example. If you are good with that then leave it as is.If not, it is an easy change to turn it into a full fledged Windows 10 PC and takes only a couple minutes BUT when you do that you will not be able to go back to S mode. Just search Microsoft S mode and a link will tell you how to turn off S.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

It isn't strong enough to handle a CS job... However, I am enjoying the Chromebook for writing, accounting, and a few other nonheavy intensive things, the long battery life does make it easy to write on the go without worrying about plugging in. Which is the biggest plus with the CB. The screen quality still bothers me quite a bit, as in order for the best viewing experience you need to be directly level with it or slightly to the side. If you have the laptop lower then yourself, it whitewashes if you look down at it from slightly above. This right here is my biggest complaint.. as I rather have the view from the sides worse than one from the top. Because this makes typing on your lap a bit more difficult of a task without having the screen tilted back at a more awkward angle, that remains useless for non-touch screens.For the price it is worth it for sure. Just to be able to browse/research/write/account/email/etc on the go. Don't expect to much in the game department, you are restricted still to the bare minimum. As for how long it will last, all Chromebook style laptops are set to become unusable within 3-5years, as each brand stops supporting them. (this is from launch, not purchase date). I do find this tactic style of sale rather rude and tactless, like the good old Nintendo time switch that had the old Nintendo's fail by flashing blue screen after a year of owning them (don't lie Nintendo the only ones alive today are those that were refurbished,/rebuilt and every system that sold during that time flatlined.)The case itself doesn't feel cheap but is obviously made of plastic. The touchpad is responsive, and the sound is fair quality, not very loud. It does have some weight to it which is on the plus side.

I didn't know that the S meant \"security?\" I think? Basically it means you can't download anything to the computer that is not found in the Microsoft Store. That was extremely frustrating because I am a Chrome Girl. I figured out how to upgrade it and now it's a normal computer.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

Return 1 (contains new requirements) or 0 (does not contain new requirements).\n", "input": "EDIT: This laptop gets WAY TOO HOT. I actually no longer recommend purchasing it. It is very capable and can do almost anything, but the cooling system is entirely insufficient. I consistently get temps of 80-90 degrees Celsius playing WoW Classic with nothing else in the background but Spotify. That game is a hundred years old and should not be taxing on the system, even at max graphics. Very concerned and disappointed about the investment I've made.If this is the only computer in your budget, I STRONGLY suggest purchasing the best cooling pad money can buy. I have settled on using an old, bulky laptop as a cooling pad which has helped. I feel bamboozled tbh.I love this laptop like Tom Cruise loved Katie Holmes before things went dark(er).It feels so much more expensive than it is. Sounds great, looks great, FEELS great.- Keyboard is wonderful. Display is beautiful.- Graphics are fantastic. I'm not missing the RTX 2060+ because I don't make a living being a caricature on livestreams.- Fan placement is logical (FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I CAN SAY THIS ABOUT MY LAPTOP) and runs VERY quiet, shockingly.- Fantastic for gaming, video editing, and everything I can throw at it, to be honest.I'm in love and will be sticking to Acer from now on.ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT:- Wavesys turns your camera on automatically by default so it can alter the sound when you plug in headphones. The idea is that the camera tracks the position of your head and adjusts the sound accordingly so you get a 360-degree experience. Great sentiment but super creepy and not something I asked for. I've disabled it. Not my kind of thing. There are so many things to set up/customize when getting a new computer and I didn't need this to be one of them.- Annoying startup sound/animation. Easy enough to turn off (you can google it and find instructions from Acer that are dummy proof bc I was able to do it) but still annoying and not needed. Again, there are so many things to set up/customize when getting a new computer and I didn't need this to be one of them.- Trackpad: I would have liked left/right-click buttons but I'm sure I'll get used to the single trackpad. It is very smooth and responsive but just FYI if you're switching over from a Macbook or something with actual buttons.Overall, a fantastic buy I'd recommend for someone looking to do everything well. If you need to do everything or something(s) at the highest level then look elsewhere. Please do your research and see if you really need to spend what YouTube channels or canned blog posts suggest. I almost bought a $2k+ machine for what this computer does incredibly well at roughly half the price.

It's also tough to know exactly what the specs of this laptop are, without getting one.For the curious, the loadout is as follows:Intel Core i5-1235U - this is a 12th gen Alder Lake part with 4P cores (with HT), and 2E cores (10 threads)WDC PC SN530 256GB - this is a PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD8GB of DDR4 (ick)The machine is pretty fast, but the 8GB of RAM is a strange choice, considering it's a 10T CPU. The screen is 1920x1080, and it appears to be an IPS panel. The screen is clear, but peak brightness is only average. The Xe IGP graphics are better than older Intel IGPs, but it's still not up to the level of what you'd get with an RDNA APU - much less a gGPU. If you're a gamer, you'll want to look elsewhere. The large 15.6\" footprint makes a large keyboard possible. The spacing is good, and the chicklet keys aren't bad, but you will get a get a decent amount of clatter and flex while typing. It's not a premium experience, but I still found it easier to type on this keyboard than on most laptops. The SSD, while a 4x unit, is about half the speed of \"nice\" PCIe 3.0 x4 units. I really didn't find it to be a bottleneck for normal business workloads, but it wasn't great when I would install massive NPM packages. The wifi capability is provided by a MediaTek MT7921 802.11ax. The card and onboard antennas work fine. Battery capacity is not stellar, and I would not expect to get more than 4 or 5 hours out of a charge. The power supply is physically tiny, with a 45W capacity. Unfortunately, there's no USB PD charging here. External connectivity consists of two USB-A ports, a full-size HDMI port, a USB-C port, a combo headphone/mic jack, an full-size SD card reader. No Thunderbolt here. The front-facing webcam is better than some, but still not good. The speakers are top-firing, and are better than many in this laptop price class. By that, I mean that they get sufficiently loud. No, they're not great, but they're fine - perfectly adequate for YouTube, podcasts, and even the occasional Netflix movie.At $625, this HP laptop is in a weird spot... It's definitely in a different performance tier than the $300-$450 laptops. It actually feels like a modded car... the CPU outclasses the rest of the machine, with the 8GB of RAM feeling like the biggest constraint. In reality, though, the 8GB is just fine for several browser tabs + Office 365. I've run several instances of VS Code at once, with Node+Express running in each. If you don't care about a machined aluminum case, an all-day battery, or a dGPU, and you JUST want good performance at the $625 price point, this is a great laptop.

Avg 10-11hrs light-medium use.Performance? 10/10 Among the best for laptops, CPU & GPU.Cooling? 10/10 on manual mode 100% fans. Not as loud as you think. 100% use on CPU and GPU results in temps of around 70 degrees for both. Really good for a laptop. Gaming on turbo is quieter and results in good temps of 75 GPU and 80 CPU as well.Value? 9/10 these new laptops are fairly expensive but the performance is there.Pros: Mechanical keyboard is actually pretty nice IMO, it makes a decent amount of noise not recommended to use in a quiet room if others are bothered by noise but it feels really good and it's very nice to type on. Performance is out of this world, remember to buy a second SSD (if needed) and 16GB of ram as adding another stick of ram will enable Dual Channel memory thereby enhancing performance overall. Backlighting and LED control are good. Screen sharpness for a 15\" is more than adequate. Very impressed.Cons: The look of the smokey see-through keyboard and the mechanical keyboard itself isn't for everyone. The keystone is a super useless gimmick but I do like the spirit behind it. Somewhat redundant FN keys for fans etc. The palm rests/plastic parts are a huge smudge-fest. If you hands are clean and dry it isn't that bad but it could be better for sure.

Recently at work I got switched to a MacBook pro and a thunderbolt docking station and that has been revolutionary for me. Since this laptop can plug right into my dock I finally felt comfortable to take the leap. And I am very pleasantly surprised! Only a few weeks into ownership and I am not only growing fond of this little machine but I even was able to sell my desktop and JUST use this.Laptop itself:Fast. Great at multitasking. Never runs out of juice with 10 cores. I can game, and review code simultaneously.It does run a bit warm when gaming though. Especially the CPU. I personally found turning off turbo via throttle stop to be the best solution and it didn't hit my game quality at all, running 50-70\u00b0c during 6 hour game sessions. Otherwise, I'd still recommend a cooling pad and limit fps. Before turning boost off, and repasting, it was running 75-100\u00b0c (thermal throttle). After repaste it runs 70-90\u00b0c normally during gaming PCGaming:Pretty much any game on high to ultra settings, 1080 or 1440p and 60fps is a breeze for this thing. I play far cry 5, halo infinite, Forza horizon 5, etcWiFi is blazing fast. I'm pulling 340mbps download in steam which is what I got on my wired PC.Screen is decent. Looks good but could be Brighter. The big con of any laptop under $2-2500. But it's brighter than my previous msi laptop so I'm happyBattery is good for what it is. ~4-5 hours web browsing or YouTube, 1-1.5 gaming depending on settings but charges lighting fast.Overall very thin, very light, very good looking laptop and the build qaulity feels great.

With that 8th gen Core i5, it's such a pleasure to use this for anything (heck, I was playing a freaking 8K video and a 4K video at the same time and it still wouldn't drop frames), all while battery life is absolutely great. The chassis is sturdy yet very light weight. Really not much to complain about. If you want a lightweight, premium, top performance ultrabook, this is the one to get.My only gripe was that the display seemed to have a bit of green tint, very noticeable when compared to my phone's calibrated display or the Samsung Chromebook Pro I tried for a while, but lowering the Green contrast to 46 from 50 in Intel Graphics settings solved it. I also bumped the saturation just +5, and the screen looks gorgeous now\u2013very similar to my small Pixel 2 which is very well calibrated. Only tip is to uninstall ASUS Splendid Video Enhancement Utility as it doesn't allow Intel Graphics Settings to stay after sleep or reboot for some reason, probably because both have calibration options and conflict with each other.With the display fixed, this thing is 10/10. Fan noise is actually very low or non existent in most tasks. Only when I put it under heavy load (like syncing 12,000 files on Google Backup & Sync) do you hear it and even then it's not annoying. And the touchpad does accidentally trigger 'double tap and drag' when you don't want to a few times, but honestly I usually disable 'double tap to drag' because I rarely drag and when I do, it's more natural to click and drag instead of double tapping.This is a great buy that will last you for a long time given the sturdy chassis and future-proof specs.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

It still works well and only degradation is the plastic air intake gill in the front right corner, that I most likely broke handling my pc by that single corner. Am now looking into upgrading/adding another ram stick, since I have the option and feel like I need more ram. As well as looking into 2nd external monitor option, although I read it supposedly supports 2 monitors, it seems for the second monitor support I need a different cable connection, mini port - which might be an issue. I ordered this after doing a 12 hour research, since I didn't know much about pc's and their components, must say this was the best money could buy for my needs back then. When buying a pc I considered I should make do with 2 drawbacks, judging from the feedback I read on forums discussing pc's. So in the end, with the budget I allocated for this, I choose sound (speakers) and battery life to be the drawbacks (instead 50%+ price tag or sacrificing other specs). In the end I didn't even notice these \"drawbacks\" as I use external speakers or headset and mostly use my pc while plugged in. I have heard people often complain about battery life and speaker quality on many pc reviews, I think that its rather odd to expect a pc to run high resource demanding games on battery power. About speakers I don't know, is it the cost or the space that impacts the quality, but it doesn't matter to me as long as its decent. If i need something better, just plug in or connect proper audio devices.

If you are looking for a \"Chromebook\", this machine is a little deceiving at first. It comes with Microsoft Windows 10 operating system in \"S\" mode. If you want to keep it in \"S mode\" that's fine; however, I think that \"S mode\" simply makes it impossible to utilize Google and other apps on a device that has the capability to do more. I turned it off on day two and I have been happy with my machine. If you aren't willing to fart with Microsoft monopoly \"s mode\" crap, I would recommend buying a Chrome book for about $100 more. I think this is a good machine with a lot of potential, but I also think \"S mode\" is stupid. It isn't safety and security that they are marketing with \"S-mode\", it's creating division and preventing free market apps unless you turn it off or elect to change operating systems.I have owned this machine for less than two weeks and I like it. I had to change mouse setting and play with that \"S Mode\" stuff, but overall I am satisfied with my replacement computer after using the same machine for 10 years (MacBook Pro).

Return 1 (contains new requirements) or 0 (does not contain new requirements).\n", "input": "UPDATE:: Here we are, over 3 years later and this is still the best laptop I have ever owned. The battery is still solid. No defects or failures in any of the hardware. Works with latest drivers without incident. And, I just noticed last night, the speaker system is still quite impressive even by today's standards.Asus, if you're listening; sell me a new version in a 17\" form factor with 10th gen tech, RAID NVMe, and none of that \"screen pad\" nonsense. Take my money!::ENDUPDATE: After using this laptop for well over a year as my primary dev workstation and gaming device, I can confirm this is very solid. I built an eGPU rig (HP Omen Accelerator/GTX 1070ti) and they work very well together (since the drivers from ~8 months ago). I can play Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 4k, medium settings at ~30-60 fps. 1080p at Max settings is stable at 60+ fps. Most other new games perform similarly.::ENDI have been researching and waiting for a device like this for a long time. The goal was a laptop that could handle heavy software development, medium gaming, has Thunderbolt 3, less than 5 lbs, and gets great battery life. This laptop has/does it all with ease. My primary focus was a solid CPU and decent monitor as my primary use case is software development. I have a MacBook Pro (Late 2016) provided by my job. While it has good CPU power, it's drivers are way behind and do not support everything Windows 10 has to offer. This ASUS has support for all Windows 10 features; specifically, I am interested in the PTP capabilities for easy multi-desktop work. It also is a nice weight at just over 4lbs. There are plenty of reviews out there, so I'll just touch on the differences I count important. The nVidia 1050 Ti GPU is a very nice value add to this already inspired laptop. I can play Portal 2 and Portal Stories with the FPS capped at 60 and the GPU usage averages 38%. I have also tested it's connectivity over its HDMI and USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort and everything works well. My secondary goal was decent mobile gaming with the option dock into an eGPU over Thunderbolt 3. While I have not tested this yet, it has the necessary ports and specs. I will update when I have the full rig built. There is currently (as of v388.13) a bug in the nVidia GPU driver that causes unacceptably high CPU and GPU clock at idle (desktop, no application running). My solution has been to disable the nVidia GPU in Device Manager when I'm not using it. Contrary to some reviews, I like the keyboard on this laptop. Yes, the keys have a bit more travel that other premium options. And yes, they are a bit softer than some. But, I like it this way. They are still fast and responsive. I cannot give this laptop that last start for the following reasons: There is not option, in North America, that I can find to get one without the touchscreen. I don't like them, I don't use them, and I don't want to pay for it. Next, it will not charge off the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports. I understand the power requirements of this device *can* go above the 100w provided by the spec. But, it should be allowed as an option given the user acknowledging the limitations. I say it *can* go above 100w but I have never seen it get even close in all my tests. That's about it. Everything else is great. I consider the ASUS ZenBook Pro, the MacBook Pro for those who want Windows for far less expense.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

The computer is fast, it's as big and heavy as my 5 year old Toshiba satellite that I am replacing, I was expecting a 17\" laptop to be thinner after 5 years especially now that the CD rom is gone. All in all it's a good laptop which is fully on and ready 5 seconds after opening it, I just wish whoever designed the keyboard would be fired or maybe executed idk. I also think its annoying that not even a gamer designed laptop can be free of a ton of bloatware. I mean really does Asus make that much money from annoying its customers with all the unneeded programs preinstalled. The battery life is awful too. The shortest of any laptop I think I've ever had. Ok so bottom line it's not perfect but I like the quality and speed of this laptop.... just keep it plugged in and dont look down!

I have bought and attempted to even use a Nobelbird Cooling Pad to see if this will help with this issue and it does help.I will not advise buying this product for gaming. Have no other issues. While playing for about 20 or so minutes before system shuts down everything is great. So for what I bought this laptop for was gaming this is the reason for my rating.After further investigation on my issue with this laptop I found that the issue was not a overheating issue but thatwhile playing my games I.E. World of Warcraft that after approximately 15 to 20 minutes of playing with the lid closedthis unit would either go into \"Sleep mode or Hibernation\" without any notice. No matter what the settings were forthe lid not doing anything when it was closed & power settings set to never for the shut down for the HD.It was evident that this is what happened cause upon starting back up my game was still running although it wasdisconnected from the servers.Thanks for the support from Amazon they were able to issue a RMA for another unit which arrived today.Other than this issue I found not other issues with this unit and would recommend this product.Another change in RATING:Final review for this piece of dog doo. The original unit that I got was having issue with shutting down while on external display \"Sanyo TV Model FW40D36F\" and with all available power setting for when the lid is closed \"DO NOTHING\". Well Amazon was good enough to do a \"RMA\" on it and now have the replacement unit all set up as theoriginal one ordered and guess what, THE SAME DARN THING IS HAPPENING WITH THIS NEW UNIT. I have searched allover for a answer to this issue but can not find any answers. Of the ones I did see I did what was advised but to noavail.So if you are looking to get a gaming laptop and want to use a larger display like a TV then I DO NOT SUGGEST THISMODEL. I know for a fact that this can be done because this TV was being used by my son on his GIGABYTE laptopwith no issues.There is an area in Windows10 about DisplayHDR capability devices for unites like this one and per Sanyo web site myTV is DisplayHDR capable, but Windows10 is saying NOT.So what am I saying, how can you believe in, Windows, ASUS or Sanyo.I can still play my games ( WoW, Anthem and TC Division2 ) with the lid slightly raised but this defeats the issue.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I found the keys going dark every 30 seconds to be super annoying but now they stay on all the time and it's great!

I enjoy the high resolution screen, seamless program operation, plug in options, soft touch keys, and many other features of this laptop.

This is my first gaming laptop though so for all I know that is the norm.I started off by running all available Windows updates then tried playing an older game \"Metro Exodus\". Within the first few minutes of playing I got the Blue Screen Of Death error and the system restarted. I figured the best step would be to update all of the drivers. The Gigabyte Control Center had options for driver updates but every time I would try to run an update the control center would freeze and shut down. The control center also does not open 75% of the time so I have to continue to click it until it would open. I ended up going straight to the Gigabyte website for driver updates and installed them that way.I tried again playing \"Metro Exodus\" but couldn't play for more than a few minutes without it going to the Blue Screen Of Death. I tried playing a few older and newer games with the same results. I then gave up for the day and tried to watch Netflix. After about 30 minutes the screen flashed black and the windows taskbar disappeared. The only thing working was Chrome. I couldn't even get CTRL+ALT+DEL to work so I had to force restart the laptop.After trying every troubleshooting step I could think of over two days I decided to try and return the laptop for a replacement. When selecting replacement amazon shows an alert \"Something went wrong. Please select another return method.\" and only gives me the option to return for a refund. The price of the laptop jumped from $1,299 to $1,599 so if I do return for a refund there is no way I'm paying $300 extra for a replacement. I tried calling Amazon's customer support to see if they could issue a replacement that way but was unable to understand the technician unfortunately (very nice guy though) and from what I gathered all they could do is forward me to Gigabytes manufacturers warranty.One other issue I had was the two times I did use the laptop on battery, within 30 minutes the battery would be down to 60% and this was while on energy saver mode and simply surfing the web.In the end I just selected return for a refund and am stuck at square one without a laptop.A quick note about the laptop itself. Overall I did like the laptop and could have seen it working for me if it didn't have all the issues listed above. It definitely seemed more than capable of handling any game I would throw at it judging by the few minutes that the games would run. This is the reason I was hoping for a replacement rather than a refund but who knows if the replacement would have had all the same issues.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

I didn't like the fact that I couldn't use any video editing software for my videos specifically Davinci Resolve 16. And everytime I tried to use Davinci Resolve 16 my screen would get frozen and show a blue error screen because the processor for this computer is only 1.80GHz to 1.99GHz. They advertised it as having 4.60GHz and that was a lie. After trying to figure out what was going on with my computer, I checked the properties of the labtop and it showed the processor as being 1.80GHz to 1.99GHz. I then checked to see the labtop I had ordered off of Amazon and then I look at the properties of the labtop and it said that it had a processor of 4.60GHz and that was incorrect. I then looked to see if they had any bad reviews and holy behold, the same thing I'm telling you is the same thing they were trying to tell me. So if you wanna edit videos and do stuff like that, then you shouldn't buy this labtop from this vendor because they're lying about the labtop properties. At the time when I bought the labtop it cost me $1,274.84, I should've known that a good labtop couldn't do what I wanted at that price but I bought because I thought was getting a good deal on the labtop.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

However, after dealing with the worse customer service I ever experianced I decided to spend my money with another company and said goodbye to Dell.I ended up between the Razor Blade 15 and the MSI GS 65. One of the things that stood out to me was that even though many of the professional reviews ranked the Razor Blade as the better laptop many of them mentioned the GS 65 as a viable lower cost option with the same performance. A review of Amazon, Best Buy and other sellers revealed that the MSI 65 was higher ranked then the Razor Blade by people who purchased the laptops with the GS 65 having 4.5 stars and the Blade 3.5.The one point that people made against the GS 65 was that it was not constructed as well as the Blade. I agree with this, holding them side by side was almost enough to go with the Blade. However the heating issue with th Blade and the fact that I would be paying hundreds of dollars more for the same performance but a better case made me go with the GS 65.The GS 65 runs like a dream with a beautiful display. I have not experianced it getting too hot and it has run everything I have thrown at it on ultra settings. The one thing I did not like is that MSI partioned the 512 SSD hardrive. Plan on undoing this next week and adding a second SSD hardrive for extra storage.As far a the GS 65\u2019s construction, after using the laptop I do not find it to be flimsy. It is lightweight and the material used for the case plays a large part in keeping the weight down.

Initially, there was a problem with the screen dimming so much when I tried to work from the battery the laptop became virtually unusable. After a 25 minute call to ASUS, the problem was fixed. However I realized that in fixing it, I lost the battery icon and had no way to know how much battery I had left. That necessitated a second call to ASUS. Once we completed that call, the original problem of the screen dimming was back, so I called a third time and finally got a fix (had to go into the bios again). Was it worth the hassle - time will tell, I've only had it two days. As of now, it is sufficiently fast for basic office applications and for online activity. I do not do gaming and suspect you'd want a Ryzen 5 processor or better for real gamers. The speakers, which are located on the underneath and both sides, are just fine. The backlit keyboard is nice. The charging cable is really flimsy and I don't know why they would skimp there. It feels like it is well-built and it is attractive. If it hadn't been such a hassle, I'd be more enthusiastic. As it is, it is perfectly fine for my uses but I am still considering returning it, although I don't feel like starting the whole process over again.

The chassis is sturdy, the screen, ports, and keyboard/Touchpad are well attached and not flimsy. The fans are not cheap parts, they are loud but they are well manufactured and perform well.- The price to part ratio is amazing. To get a 2070RTX in this range elsewhere, you would lose on quality of parts elsewhere. With this one you get a nice GPU and the rest of the laptop matches its quality.- The Mobility is perfect. Some (like my last) were too heavy, got too hot, or the ports are in weird locations. This laptop places the ports perfectly, and they are built in well, no loose connections. The weight is a relief for the power this has. And heat displacement is probably one of the best in the industry. This unit will simply not die to heat if you treat it right.- The keyboard quality is amazing as well, the keys feel solid not flimsy, and it is spaced perfectly for me with big hands. Numberpad is a plus, the FN key when pressed lights up all the FN keys so you know what your enabling, very innovating and amazing job by engineering.Overall I would say this laptop is like the AK47 of gaming laptops. Solidly built and even after taking a beating it looks like it will still go forward.

My workaround was to purchase a 'StarTech Slim USB 3.0 (or newer like 3.1) to HDMI External Video Card Multi Monitor Adapter' (Part # USB32HDES) for $50. It plugs into a standard Type A USB 3.0 port and works perfectly. Now I have 2 external monitors that are not mirrored. They are independent monitors. Each can display a different image.

I see another reviewer showed some specs so no use in repeating that. I guess the only thing I would like to see in these \"GAMING\" labeled laptops is higher capacity M.2 drives.. A 1Tb option would have made this a perfect value but I won't deduct a star. The reason I say that, is any more, many games consume alot of space, and if you have a huge collection, well.. you run out pretty quick. 512gb on this one is actually within reason and expected.. I guess I'm just griping that I'd like to see large quantity, fast storage, also become a standard when one claims to have a \"GAMING\" laptop.

Frikin' chrome can easily fill that miserable 16gb.MY PHONE HAS MORE RAM !!!Still given the options between the Z13 and the X13, then the Z13 is way more useful for travelling, commuting, reading, drawing, watching movies, gaming in between meetings, and the touch display is awesome.THE KEYBOARD IS NOT WIRELESS !!! and the connector is industrial strength, I cracked the keyboard trying to detach it. So don't even try...The battery lasts 4 hours of movies (using the integrated graphics), about 2 hours if you engage the 3050.There is an extra USB-C inside the XG connector that you can use, i.e. for a monitor.The XG can only be connecter in one position, behind the Z13, that's it. Any other position is just not viable. The cable is too short to place the XG on the Z13's right side, and cannot bend to place the XG on the left side. Also the XG can only be positioned in one way, upside up, tilted back, with the LED directly into your eye, always.The carry bag is a joke. It comes with an attachable-section to place your XG. But the attached-section relies on the flimsies cheapest plastic clip, so no go. Plus, only the Z13 fits in the bag, and only the XG fits in the attachable-section, soooo NO ROOM FOR THE POWER ADAPTER NOR THE XG CABLES ... genius.The devil is in the details and many Z13 details are just dumb.

The video card runs games smoothly, the SSD is blazing fast, WiFi 6 works nicely, DP port outputs to 4k 60FPS on my TV and so far I've only had some minor problems that are software related I had to fix. I'll admit the Gigabyte software isn't the best but once I fixed this issue it works fine. One thing annoying was it would reset the keyboard led back to the rainbow effect after you change it in the control center. To fix this I went into task manager in the startup tab and disabled FusionStartUp so now it keeps my changes. Not sure what FusionStartUp does because everything seems to be working great in the control center now. If you want a gaming laptop but don't want to shell out over $2000 then this is a great choice. I do wish they placed the power plug in the back instead of on the right side, but not a huge deal breaker. Maybe it's there because of the cooling fans inside since the fans can get fairly noisy, but it's better than having the GPU throttle etc since it's a 130 watt GPU. I would recommend this to anyone seeking a good gaming laptop in this price range who wants a 130 watt 3070 instead of a 3060. I've seen many laptops that were close to this price range that only had a 3060, so I figured I had to give it a chance and cross my fingers.

New requirements indicate features that the computer does not currently have. Return 1 (contains new requirements) or 0 (does not contain new requirements).\n", "input": "First, I'll just tell you that, yes, this computer is incredibly awesome. Then I'm going to nitpick it as much as I can just to give you an honest perspective and hopefully some details you haven't already figured out.My last primary home laptop was an Alienware 17. It came out after Windows 8, but it ran 7 because everyone still hated 8. I knew it was getting old, but I didn't want to give up that super-high-quality feel. That computer was really large and substantial, which was both a fault and gave it a luxurious feel that I thought couldn't be reproduced. ...a long time ago, I had no real opinion of Asus, but then my Dad actually got a ROG at some point and I was sort of amazed that this brand that I would have almost considered generic at the time put out such a fine piece of hardware. So when I had a chance to get this computer, I knew it was good enough to replace the Alienware. And it is, absolutely. This computer is about half the weight and much smaller, but it still feels substantial and \"super premium\". This does have a compressed keyboard (the Alienware actually was wide enough to have a separate number pad), but it's spread out enough as to not be cramped or annoying. And thank God the Delete key is in an intuitive place! (I find that a problem with many laptops). As always, a new touchpad takes some getting used to, but I have it configured how I want it now, and I even finally gave in and started doing two-finger scrolling...I need to get these gripes out of the way, although they apply to almost all pre-built computers: Too much crapware and ads that won't let you alone at first (RE: McAfee), but not nearly as much as a lot of cheap computers. I hate that Microsoft won't even let you use your own hardware without getting you to make an account for their stupid software. I'm not sure you could even start using this computer if you don't have an active Internet connection (or they're making it harder and harder to find a workaround, but I'm getting too bored and jaded to bother fighting it anymore). Windows 11 at least seems to work well and look good, but they still have some super annoying features from trying to be too much like Apple. I just can't stand that we have some settings under Settings and others under Control Panel. I hate the Apple feel of Settings, but to have to use both is just stupid. Then you can't ungroup icons in the taskbar and I hate the button to turn off Wifi because it's too easy to hit. This is not a phone! OK...point is, I wish MS would respect its customers the way they used to.On to more specific nitpicks:1) Once in a while, I still turn on the number pad on the touchpad accidentally. This is a super cool feature, but I'm not sure if I'll ever get used to using it for typing in phone numbers and stuff like that. The overhead on having to tap and hold the corner first if a bit much, and then it's easy to forget to turn off. Of course, if you're doing spreadsheets, you'll probably be thrilled to have that on a midsize laptop.2) As usual, the included control center software, \"Armoury Crate\", is quirky in how it works with Windows. As with my previous Alienware, it's now only the second computer I have left such software installed and allowed to run (not sure you could get all the lights working otherwise), but it takes some fidgeting to get used to, and I had some issues with WiFi not coming back on and stuff that I attribute to this. At some point, you just have to give Windows back control of the power settings. Once I got it all working in harmony (basically just using \"Armoury Crate\" for the lights) it's doing fine. I'm still not convinced about leaving the other Asus software on there - it keeps bothering me about updating, but it seems redundant not only to Windows, but to Armoury Crate as well.3) The Screen doesn't tilt back quite as much as I'd like it to. I'm glad it seems to have a sturdy mechanism to hold it in place, but I could use just a few more degrees on a day like today: Sitting in a super comfortable chair with my leg crossed at 90 degrees, back of the laptop on the leg. I can still use it fine, but a few more degrees would be ideal.4) Another common problem: I wish they'd put twin power ports on the back and side of the device so you could pick which one you wanted to use. The battery is great, so I'm not using power now, but power out the back doesn't work with the position I'm sitting in described above. Also, I put it back on a small table near the couch when not in use, but it's slightly annoying to plug and unplug. Much of that has to do with the fact that there is a \"goiter\" (I think it's used to cancel out capacitance, but I'm not sure) on the power cord right near the barrel jack. This is just in the way and gets caught on the back of the table.BTW, the power brick is huge, which doesn't surprise me, but I absolutely love that you can plug in with power delivery, which means you can use this with a proper USB-C docking station. I guess you'll still want the power brick for hardcore gaming, but I love the option.5) No USB ports on the right side. Not a big deal, but sometimes you want the option depending where you are or how you're sitting. They use the space for some add-on thing they want to sell you instead...6) I get sick of trying to keep up with WiFi, but I actually just got a WiFi 6E AP, and it's awesome to be able to use it. I think they really did get rid of some latency there. It's pretty awesome when things get noticeably better. And I haven't even gotten the AP working optimally yet...Also 2.5Gb LAN port. I don't have a 2.5Gb capable switch yet, but I'll have to work on that because my AP has a port for that as well...7) I know everyone wants to hear about game performance: I haven't been able to bog this thing down with anything. I can play 2020s era games and have it transcoding for Plex in the background, and it barely spins up the fans. I mean, I can't give you anything but anecdotal evidence, so I'll leave that to professional electronics reviewers, but I'll just tell you it is as awesome as they say. At this point in time, I don't think there's anything this can't handle (at least that you'd likely be doing at home). And, just as importantly, it really is quiet and doesn't seem to run exceptionally hot, either. My last laptop could get so annoyingly loud.8) Battery. I was surprised to see the battery's Ah rating was barely higher than my previous computer, but then even more surprised how much better the power must be managed, because it'll more or less last all day if I'm just doing work-work (like spreadsheets and boring stuff) and web browsing. So it has the feel of a great all around, everyday type of computer (and you can even turn the lights off if you want to be low key), but then you can instantly turn it into a real powerhouse. You can have a profile for use with a docking station for work, one to maximize battery life for leisurely web browsing around the house, and one for use with the power brick as a gaming rig. Versatility is fantastic.9) I had some weird quirks early on, and called customer service. One thing was the WiFi I was talking about earlier and one was the screen doing weird stuff. I partly called customer service just because I wanted it on file that I was having issues in case I did need a repair. Normally I wouldn't just because I normally know better than they do... But I got a real person quickly and he gave me non-condescending advice and made a file for me. I just had to do some random driver updates and it seemed to work. Now, I don't think things should ship needing updates, but...at least they have real customer service.Well, I could probably pontificate for 10 times this long, but the conclusion is that after the minor pains of changing computers and getting used to some slight hardware differences, getting past the frustration of Microsoft and a few typical antivirus program ads, doing little tweaks to get the touchpad working for me instead of against me, and screwing around with updates until my problems went away, I am 100% happy with the computer. Not just happy, but thrilled. This is the kind of hardware that once you experience as your own, you really can't go back.

It was exactly what she needed, that is a light laptop that she could put in a backpack and take with her to class but with the power to do all of class tasks she needed, good battery life and the ability to play movies, surf the web etc. in her down time. This computer did all that... until it didn't. When my daughter came home from school on her first break she said \"Hey Dad, the sound has quite working on this computer.\" I did all the usual internet researching and it appeared to be a driver problem. We worked with ASUS to get the correct drivers etc. to no avail. ASUS tech support finally concluded that there was a hardware failure. Since the machine was still under warranty we shipped it in and a in a couple of weeks we got it back with everything working. When my daughter came home on her next break not only was the sound not working again, but the wireless network card was also not working. I called ASUS tech support again and once again after hours of loading drivers etc they concluded that it was probably a hardware failure. The difference this time was that the year warranty had ended two weeks before. They told me I could still ship it in but they would charge me 400 dollars to do the repairs. That's more than halfe the cost of the machine new. Needless to say we didn't do that. So, the bottom line is I paid 750 dollars for a machine that was seriously hampered by hardware failure twice on two different components in the course of a year. Although I like the machine at this point there is no way I can recommend anything that has such apparent issues.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

The dialpad completely stopped functioning after a week, having only used it once to adjust volume, while never leaving my desk since unboxing. The wifi drops out constantly (and I have an excellent home network). The keyboard is really abysmal, I mean honestly it's quite awful - both the tactile feeling, key travel, and layout since the touchpad is not centered with the space bar I am constantly resting my right palm on it which is uncomfortable and causing many accidental swipes/ clicks and typos. The HDMI connection to external model is very outdated, (1.4), causing very laggy transfer and low resolution. There shouldn't be outdated hardware on a newly released laptop design. There is a glaring obvious defect of the touchpad having a wide gap on the left exposing hardware inside the laptop, also the audio jack is not centered to the cutout. The sound is TERRIBLE, I get better audio out of my 6 year old android phone than this supposed \"creator\" laptop; the quality is disgusting, which I can deal with on a laptop, but the max volume itself is like a whisper. I cannot hear people on online zoom or teams meetings, youtube, hulu and netflix. Forget about it, can't hear a thing. I have also been experiencing frequent screen glitching where a \"ghost\" shadow of a window stays on the screen constantly until I reboot the system. Lastly, there is an awkward gap on the left side of my touchpad where some of the internals behind the touchpad are exposed- BAD quality control here, the touchpad was attached askew and not centered correctly to the cutout. I really wanted to like this laptop and trust ASUS build, but frankly it has been an epic disappointment, especially for $1550 after tax. I will be returning it today and would not recommend this version until they fix their QC.

I think that it mostly delivers on that idea, but this is still an $1100 machine and other brands like Lenovo are capable of delivering the same specs with a good screen and a little RGB (at least on the keyboard).The first thing I did when I got this laptop was upgrade the Ram to 32GB, mostly just to see if it would cause any problems using third party, 3200Mhz DDR4. I was really annoyed to see that there is no easy way to expand the storage. This laptop has a single M.2 slot and no place to install a 2.5-inch SATA SSD. The only thing that can be upgraded at all, is upping the Ram to 32GB (it will support 3rd party sticks at the full speed of 3200MHz).The Ryzen 7 5800H is one of the most powerful 45 watt processors from AMD, it is still quite good but it has been replaced by the 6800H. The difference isn't huge, but it's worth mentioning that you are getting a 2021 CPU in a 2022 laptop. The 3050Ti is still current generation, as it will be a while before the laptop versions of Nvidia's 4000 series GPUs are released. It has a 75 watt TGP, which is close to the top end of how the 3050Ti can be configured. I have used another laptop that has an 85 watt version of the 3050Ti and the performance of the two laptops is very similar and I wouldn't be worried much about it being slightly less than the maximum TGP.I really love the keyboard on this Victus, it's backlit but the only color is white. I think some people might prefer this look because it's more conventional, and kind of just looks like a regular laptop. The trackpad is really smoot and accurate, it's pretty large as well (for a Windows laptop). It's slightly off-centered, but it's not as bad as some laptops.The port selection is good, I wish they would have given us at least one 3.2 gen 2 USB C port, but all the ports top out at 5 Gigabits per second, not a huge deal, but it seems like another unnecessary feature to leave out. Just like the lack of power delivery charging via the USB C port, it's only data and video output only, no PD charging of the laptop itself. If it was available, it wouldn't provide enough power to allow you to play games, but it could work if you were using the laptop for anything non-gaming related.The last thing that I have to mention is the screen, it is 1080p with a 144Hz refresh rate, but the colors are kind of dull and disappointing for a laptop that costs over $1,000. It only has a 45%NTSC color space, which is pretty far from 100% sRGB. It's not awful or anything like that, but it's another compromise you have to make if you buy this HP Victus. If they could have given us a good screen for this price, then I could have forgiven the rest of the shortcomings. I just don't understand why they didn't try a little harder to make this competitive with other gaming laptops around the $1,000-$1,200 price range. It's like 85% of what you would get from the competition, assuming you bought wisely. So, in and of itself, it's a decent gaming laptop and you won't likely be able to find much better in the way of internal specs (CPU/GPU/RAM) for this same price, but you will find some with better screens and the same CPU/GPU that also have a 2nd M.2 slot for adding another SSD. It's up to each individual buyer to decide of these things are a big deal to them or not.Pros+Roughly the same price as other systems using a R7 plus a 3050TiNice, large trackpad and a good, backlit keyboard3050ti is configured at 75 watts (not the highest possible but close)HDMI port is version 2.1Nondescript chassis might be appealing to people who want/need a dedicated GPU without RGB and an over the top designCons-Screen is only 250 nits of brightness and 45% NTSC (you should get 100% sRGB and 300-350 nits of brightness for $1100 with these specs)No USB C chargingAll USB ports are limited to 5 Gigabits per secondNo way to add more storage short of replacing the drive that has Windows installed on it. What\u2019s worse is that there was a place on the logic board for a second M.2 slot but HP chose not to install it on this version.There are other laptops for this price with the same specs, better screens, and with 2x NVMe M.2 slots for more storage (which equals more room to store games)Update: I realized that virtualization based security was enabled on this laptop, if you turn the \u201ccore isolation/memory integrity\u201d slider to off in the Windows Security application, performance for gaming will increase by a substantial margin.
