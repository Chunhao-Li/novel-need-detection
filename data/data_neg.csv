"When the fans kick on FULL blast, wow it is loud."
it was not consistently fast

The laptop is extremely flimsy I was so afraid to bump it on anything so I bought a padded laptop sleeve and a padded backpack for it.
Out of the box had this odd micro-stutter unless you ran it with the dedicated graphics or integrated graphics only.
"Dedicated graphics kills battery, integrated graphics good luck playing Youtube at 1080p"

One last positive is that the fans are not too loud when running.
The main problem I found with the laptop is that it heats up very quickly
The only con I have so far is what it takes to add another hard drive or more RAM

The SSD died within 5 months
I also have had numerous issues with one of the left side USBs dropping connection
One of the fans has decided to start screeching due to being misaligned from wear and the laptop is unusable.

the keyboard is a little flimsy
You get fingerprints all over this computer.
I am pretty sure that this thing is actually a fingerprint magnet.
it gets to be pretty noticeable when you have oil marks all over the keys and the touchpad.
the touchpad has a mind of its own
I have gotten to the point where I lock the touchpad whenever I am typing something for a length of time because I have already accidentally deleted two pages of an assignment... twice.
it has a pretty minimal battery life
"the motherboard is flipped upside-down, making upgrading very hard"
Gets fairly hot with gaming and battery life is not great
the light bleed at the top corners of the screen is a little too much

seems to be made of a cheaper material
