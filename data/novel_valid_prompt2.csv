(Great computer!!): Great for what I need and the value!!,0
"(Cost, features and durability.): What I like about the product is the cost, the features and the size of the screen, keyboard, and overall structure. I am currently using this laptop for personal use and for work.",0
"(Crazy fast): I could not be more pleased with this purchase. Being Samsung Galaxy 9 users...this seamlessly sync with my phone, gmail, and it is out performing my $ 1800.00 Dell. Unbelievable and unbeatable pricing. Well done.",0
"(Great laptop but poor packaging by the seller): Upon arrival the laptop powers on but has a black screen. Ive tried to restart it, hard reset it, plug it into a monitor, etc. The screen was dead on arrival. As for the packaging, the seller put the laptop box inside a giant hollow amazon box with no padding at all. The laptop probably rolled around in the giant hollow amazon box for 2 weeks before making it to me with a dead screen.",0
"(Well-built laptop with respectable specs): The value of this laptop can't be understated. There are no real weaknesses here. The only notable problems people may have with it are the fan noise while gaming and the lack of ""silent"" fan operation when not gaming. You won't notice the idle whirl of fans unless you are in a completely silent room with no music or headphones in play.Besides that, the gaming performance is top-notch. Handles all games on high with zero problems at 60+fps. The notoriously poorly-optimized Cyberpunk ran at medium-high for me with 60-70fps. Solid.The trackpad is good, well-positioned. The keyboard has good travel and is fairly quiet. I bought this primarily for the keyboard and screen, which most laptops are bottom-tier these days on both fronts. The numberpad is nice, I wish there was a way to fit the 0 key two-wide, but that's not important, just typist quirks. The screen is plenty bright for any indoor situation, does fine outside under indirect sun, thanks to the lack of glossy coating. The 144hz is nice for older games or some buttery-smooth indy sidescrollers.The weight of this laptop is obvious, but not unbearable. I like the fact that this laptop doesn't feel cheap. The plastic shell on the bottom is hard and strong. If I dropped this thing like a complete fool, I think it would survive 2-3 feet without a break--maybe a chip or dent.Overall, for me, this laptop is unbeatable in this price range. With the reviews of higher-end laptops, it sounds like you'd be wasting money for 5-10fps difference if you look at. Remember, there's only so much you can do within the power limits of a laptop.",0
(Great value and delivered as promised!): The ThinkPad was delivered quicker than advertised and it works wonderful. All systems are set up and working great!,0
"(Happy but with a catch): There is a lot to love about this laptop including a beautiful, crisp display and great functionality. Glad I opted for the 16gb ram. Really speeds up my processing time using Adobe Lightroom. I spent a lot of time looking at laptop specs and appreciate that this one has two USB-A and one USB-C ports as well as HDMI. I really misread the port specs however and thought this had a SD slot but it only has Micro-SD which is practically useless. There are no adapters that take SD down to Micro-Sd. Lots of adapters that take Micro-SD to SD however. Not sure what the engineers were thinking. Now I have another adapter to buy. If engineers can put two SD slots in my DSLR it would seem they can put one in a laptop.",0
"(Just as good as advertised): Very good laptop overall. The 300Hz screen is great and color reproduction is amazing too. Keyboard is nice and the large trackpad is also very responsive. While playing heavy duty games for a long time make sure to slightly elevate the laptop from the table as it allows for better cooling. I can get around 180-200 frames with low graphics, 100% screen resolution and MUX switch on.This review is written to extend my warranty for the laptop however my views are completely honest and reflect my true experience with the laptop.",0
(I like it but): I seriously like this laptop! affordable and it feels solid. the only thing I didn't like is the USB-C couldn't do a video out. everything else is top notch,0
"(Nice screen and handles most tasks): I bought this for my son to use for schoolwork and browse the internet. It doesn't play games, it doesn't run MS Office, it doesn't work well without an internet connection. But you know what? It doesn't matter. My son plays most of his games on a console. Google has pretty decent apps available for word brocessing and basic spreadsheets. And it's easy enough to find a place with an internet connection.I'd buy one for myself if I didn't already have a laptop.",0
"(A good family machine): So far great! Have only had for under 1 week, but very happy. The battery life is very long, easy to figure out. Good for your whole family.",0
"(Awful computer): I'm pretty sure this computer was a refurbished item and wasn't labelled as such. Kept shutting down, screen would either freeze or go completely blank. Wiped out my daughter's entire school project. Do not buy...product suckedNo battery life....",0
(IS BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE IT): I thought it was going to be bigger but i still love it.,0
(Gaming): This is my first gaming laptop n so far I am enjoying it. It does get a little loud but it’s alright with me. It runs games pretty smooth. For the battery life I usually keep it plug in when I’m gaming. I would recommend this to a friend who wanted to do some laptop gaming.,0
"(Nice computer, terrible display): The display only looks good from one very particular angle. Other wise, it looks faded and the colors are extremely weak.",0
"(Laptop is everything I had hoped for): This laptop is great for competitive gaming. The 144hz screen is great, the response time is excellent, and the colors are nice. I mainly play FPS games and it suits my needs as a desktop replacement. I mainly play Valorant and get a very consistent 144 FPS. I would say that the laptop is not very portable as the battery life is not great however as someone who always keeps it plugged in, this is not an issue for me. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend this for anybody who wants a high powered gaming laptop.",0
"(Bang for your buck): This computer is overall a good laptop. The worst I can tell about it is the webcam. My 2009 Lenovo has better webcam.For the heat, I use it on a stand with a cooling pad not because of it is being hot, it is because of I use it some sort of a ""compact desktop"" computer. So I do not move it at all.",0
"(Quiet lapotp. Comes with HDMI 2.0 and Display Port 1.2. You may or may not care.): I will get right into it. For a gamer, the laptop is quiet and capable. Although there have been some reports of screen issues, I believe those may have been an inconsistency with the first batches, and the issues have been worked out by now.But let's review some caveats. This model (82B1000AUS) comes with HDMI 2.0 (not 2.1 which is a bit of a let down) and USB-C with Display Port 1.2 capabilities. Which one is a better option? Honestly, there is virtually no difference, unless you include HDMI 2.1 which brings noticeable benefits.[Hdmi 2.0]Supports resolutions up to 3840x2160 (4K UHD) with a 60Hz refresh rate, or 60 frames per second.18Gbps bandwidth.[Hdmi 2.1]Supports 3840x2160 (4K UHD) with a refresh rate of 120Hz, or 120 frames per second.Supports 7680x4320 (8K) with a 60Hz refresh rate, or 60 frames per second.The standard in PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.48Gbps bandwidth.[DisplayPort 1.2]Supports resolutions up to 3840x2160 (4K UHD) with a 60Hz refresh rate, or 60 frames per second.17.28Gbps bandwidth.[DisplayPort 2.0]Supports resolutions higher than 7680x4320 (8K) and 8K with a refresh rate of 120Hz, or 120 frames per second.80Gbps bandwidth.A laptop that has HDMI 2.1 or DP 1.4+ would cost you much more. And, to be quite honest, if you are really serious about gaming, a laptop will never beat a desktop in regards to performance, features, biodegradability, thermals, etc... So enjoy your laptop and leave serious gaming to the desktop because at this price, this laptop is a good buy.",0
"(Good buy): Kid loves it....it does everything needed for games, homework, and what not. Has been a good purchase!",0
(Nice for the price.): Nice for the price.,0
(Incredible machine.): This is an incredible machine. Great price and well worth it. I love it so far.,0
(Happy): Contenta con el producto,0
(Functional for college and gaming.): Very functional laptop. Good for school work and gaming. Skyrim has never run so smoothly. My only criticism is that it is prone to fingerprints. I don't particularly mind the lack of CD drive since most software is downloadable these days and I rarely burn CDs.,0
"(Buena opcion calidad precio): Es una laptop con gran calidad, buen procesador y buena memoria, una buena opcion para el rango de precio.",0
"(Great deal for the money): This is a great computer great for multi-tasking. I am very pleased, thank you!",0
(Quilty): My granddaughter loved it!,0
(Disappointing and Underwhelming): Very UNDERWHELMING.Definitely returning for a refund.Ran 3 benchmark tests and it scored so poorly. The graphics card is so bad it’s struggled to even complete a basic graphic test. And the i5 processor feels super dated compared to i7s of similar price. Based on the specs I was ready to love this machine but it performed so poorly I have no choice but to return it.,0
(Great laptop): It is exactly what I wanted...so fast..really lightweight...very satisfied,0
"(It comes good): Its total functionally and like new, a good prices and excellent product",0
(Make sure to upgrade the ram with a 16 gb stick install is easy once bottom comes off): Fast laptop once you upgrade the ram to 16gb overall then its a beast! Also a lot of bloatware to Uninstall and windows updates to install. Took a few hours to get it set the way I wanted for the better.,0
"(Screen flickering issues): Asus supports tries to help but nothing helps. This is the second laptop, first was replaced due to the same issue.....This one is going back as well. Screen flickers and drives me nuts. 2 starts because amazon support made returns easy. Product is nice looking and I wanted it to work but...…..what a waste of a month with these things.",0
"(Majorly disappointing): First, Acer, why would you choose to mess with the established keyboard template? There is no ""end"" key. There is a ""search"" key where the caps lock key should be. And using tiny lowercase letters on an un-unbacklighted keyboard? WHY? I use the chrome browser so I was confident this would be what I needed for my mostly internet computer use. I did the research and asked questions and made sure I got the model with a card reader as I take lots of photos. After struggling and several chats, either the card reader does not work or no one is able to explain to me how to transfer my photos from the card to the computer. Amazon was kind enough to comp me an adapter which changed nothing. Still, no indication of how to get the pics from the card to the machine after the card is inserted and wipe the card afterward. So between my ancient, broken pinkie hitting the assinine ""search"" key and sending me to another plane of existence altogether, being unable to see the letters on the keyboard except at high noon in direct sunlight and not having whatever ""Intuition"" it takes to run an ""intuitive"" OS, this junk is going back to the company.I noticed very many ""refurbished"" Chromebook units for sale and now I think I know why. Will be happy to have my money back and end the frustration of trying to get help to run the thing. Good-Bye!",0
Only offering Win 10 Home,0
(Don't get it for Zoom or videoconferencing): It has poor connectivity with WiFi. Zoom barely works - so laggy and glitchy. It's not my internet as other devices run smoothly. It was under 200 bucks so I guess this is what I get.,0
"The GPU is very powerful for this size, it eat everything I through at it.",0
don't plan on getting too crazy with the 3D gaming,0
(Kids loved them.): This was the deal for the money I could find for chrome books for our kids. They live the large screen. Only drawback with chrome books is they are almost impossible to protect from inappropriate sites for kids.,0
"(Windows 11 s mode): Good quality computer for the price. Just be aware that the operating system is a Windows S. This feature will not allow you to install any third party apps such as Chrome, Steam etc. Easy enough to turn off.",0
The touchscreen is every bit as good as any I have ever tried.,0
(Bad didplay): Laptop delivered with a bad display. Returned for a different laptop.,0
Fans are kind of noisy when gaming or performing processor intensive tasks,0
"(Not worth it.): 2 stars is ""I don't like it"", which is true. Its cheaply made. My first one had a issue with the sound, couldn't hear from internal speaker or through headphones. With this one, the frame for the screen has peeled off from the screen so now I gotta glue it together. Another issue is it sounds like there is a wire that is loose and is being hit by the fan. Also, it often runs very hot with just a browser open or Netflix running. I have to operate a Linux partition to avoid that last issue but there are somethings I must use Windows for. This is sad because my last Asus laptop was less expensive but ran much better than this. Best thing about this thing is the long battery life and nice display, but overall it's not worth it.",0
(Good but bad battery): Jus t got the laptop yesterday and so far it has met all of my needs but their is one major flaw that makes this laptop kinda trash and that is the battery life.Overall good laptop but battery life sucks full charge is about 1hr and 45min to 2hr,0
"(Casual Gamer who has a Macbook for Work Stuff): I use a Macbook for work because I'm a photographer/layout designer so I need my colors to be spot on, BUT I was really missing out with so many games being Windows only. My priority wasn't graphics - it was something that would run well and not break the bank. With a protection plan and tax this ended up being ~$800 and I love it! On my Mac even Darkest Dungeon was slow, but now I can easily play Witcher 3, Vampyr, and Genshin Impact (don't laugh at me - my sister got me into it and now we're constantly competing to outlevel each other :D)I think if you're one of those folks who builds your own machine or gets into debates about the best processors, then this may not be quite up to your standards. But if you're like me and you literally just want something that'll run your games smoothly and act as a backup for any word processing or basic business stuff you need to do, it's a solid machine. Starts up quick, runs beautifully, and I personally think the red keyboard backlight is cool.These are the reasons it hasn't replaced the Mac entirely:1) Poor battery life. (Maybe a couple of hours.)2) Really heavy compared to a Macbook Air!!!! If you're a student looking for a campus laptop, take this into consideration because I can tell you from experience that carrying a heavy bag for four years will give you at least one touchy shoulder...3) The color scheme is off. I've tried manually adjusting it but I'm spoiled with the Retina display.All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase - AND I didn't have to drop 2k. Win win! I will definitely consider Acer products for the future, both for gaming and business. (Although I kinda like keeping the two machines separate.)",0
(Amazing budget laptop!!!!): This laptop is amazing!!! I've never owned a gaming pc or laptop before and I got this on sale for $700. The screen resolution is awsome. I've been playing on a 4k TV with my ps5 for years and I hardly notice a difference. I also upgraded the ram to 24gigs and performance is awsome! Super pleased with this for my entry into pc gaming. If you're looking for a budget gaming laptop. THIS IS IT!,0
(It’s super duper awesome): Super duper awesome,0
"(Broke Down on me Twice): Bought this laptop twice for college, broke down on me twice in one month. Neither laptop lasted more than 24 hours functioning correctly. Tried to start them over and just keep freezing.",0
(Description of item is misleading.): Description said laptop had a touchscreen. It does NOT!!!😡😡😡,0
"(DO NOT BUY: I do not recommend at all): I am writing this amendment to my review on my older laptop, which the Predator was supposed to replace. Why is this? Well, let's follow the timeline.UPDATES3 months: Computer is running excessively hot, to the point where it caused blisters on my right pinky finger because it's a slow heat and I didn't know it was burning me. The SSD C drive complained of critical failure every time the temperature hit a peak, and I had to start shutting it down every 45 minutes. Even using a cooling fan base did not cool it off.4 months: Computer randomly shutting off some programs, like the caps lock indicator I need, and turning others back on, like Cortana. Getting random lag all over. No programs running. It was ultimately found to be the overclocking and heat. Couldn't shut overclocking off.7 months: Reset to factory because of corrupted files; unknown cause. No biggie, I keep everything on a separate, removable drive so I can reset without losing anything even if I wipe the C drive. Everything worked fine after that. Overclocking and overheating remained hyperactive--that is not supposed to happen with a factory reset. Was this thing programmed to kill itself?8 months: The keyboard is acting up even worse than before with typing in multiple letters. Heat is peaking at the highest it's been and I can only be on it for 5 minutes before it needs a break. This was just having it on. I wasn't running any programs and did not have it plugged in, which makes it get hotter even faster. I let it sit for 5 minutes, doing nothing, and it was whirring like a jetliner having a heart attack despite Task Manager showing no active programs running. Only overclocking was running and I couldn't shut it off, as usual.1 year, 1 month; warranty barely expired: One day, after I'd fallen asleep at the Acer, I woke to find it unresponsive. Hit the power button. Nothing. Panic began to set in. Removed the bottom cover and disconnected the battery so I could allow it to sit for 30 mins. Turned it on. Predator sound and logo spread across the screen. Whew. Problem averted. Got to the login screen, then the computer just shut itself off. Never mind, problem not averted. Tried it again, then again, then again. I was in a serious panic at this point. After 10 times I went back and read the 1-star reviews. This is a rectangular coaster, unworthy of anyone's money. I should have returned this after getting a second dud--first with a broken pixel and second with an overactive keyboard input (inserting multiples of one letter press). The majority of the 5-star reviews are fake, while the 1- and 2-star and some 3-star ones are authentic. Read the 1-star if you want a good feel for this laptop's performance.In the pits of despair and having no access to my work documents, I suddenly remembered my old Asus. My ancient potato of a laptop. I went over and grabbed it from its dusty grave, then revived it, started it up with my drives from the Acer activated as my boot drive, and retrieved some info I hadn't managed to save. I love this Asus. And now I am writing this review amendment on it.Why am I being so scathing instead of polite? Well, I tried to contact Acer support multiple times. Four times, the contact just hung the call up without responding. Three times I just got hung up on for no apparent reason while trying to see if the laptop could be repaired. And once, I got a really rude, ill-tempered person who sounded more accusing than helpful. The worst part was sifting through people I could barely understand. Never again. I will not ever purchase another Acer product. They can shove it and I hope they bury themselves. Nothing from Acer has ever worked for me, but because of the cool-looking new laptop and 5-star reviews, I was duped into thinking they'd improved their shoddy, cheap trash.Shame on me.My amendment would not be so harsh had I received quality customer support.Or a functional computer.That thing is not worthy of existing. Shame it looks so fantastic. That's the only good thing about it.....ORIGINAL REVIEWFor the price, this is an absolutely fantastic piece of gaming equipment! I had to exchange the first one because there was a broken pixel which would catch things above its designated area, causing a strobe effect when moving over certain terrain. Second laptop had no defects.Whhy four stars? Well, do you see that double ""h""? That's why. I have looked for a solution to this problem. Reinstalled drivers, changed key press sensitivity, changed the hoold down sensitivity, everything suggested across multiple forums. I was told it was me, at one point. I've never run into this issue in my life. It's not all the time, but as a writer, it's a noticeable nuiisance. I have to go back and correct a lot of my typing because of it. I lightly tap a key and it stamps an extra in there for no reason, sometimes even doing a triple letter. I can only conclude it may be the laptop, itself. I don't know, because I cannot get an answer.Other than that little problem, it handles even the heaviest GPU/CPU-consuming games I have, and it handles Photoshop and other rendering services magnificently. (I started editing my post at this point because it just gets ridiculous.) Games run so smoothly that it's changed them all in my opinion.",0
(Good laptop): Works very well. Literally boots up in seconds.,0
"(Buena inversión teniendo en cuenta el costo): Estoy satisfecho con la compra, tardó 1 semana en llegar a Costa Rica, menos del tiempo estimado muy rápido! Es una muy buena opción tomando en cuenta el precio por el tipo de máquina que es, le daré uso para la universidad y algunos juegos casuales. La pantalla es excelente y si bien, en algunos comentarios indican lo contrario debido a los ángulos de visión, la verdad no es un factor que me afecte ya que la utilizo en un escritorio, es cuestión de gustos.Con respecto al sonido, siempre se ha sabido que las portátiles tienen un sonido estándar, para mejor audio, compras unos parlantes y listo! Si quieres una laptop algo exigente, hay otras opciones a mayor precio. De momento 0 quejas con la máquina es una excelente opción, la recomiendo para aquellas personas que no deseen gastar mucho y busquen algo decente para estudio y algunos juegos casuales.",0
"(All around awesome machine, but heavier than others.): A little heavy for my preference. It does have a bigger screen, so it makes up for it.Also, it seems like is large enough to have a ten key, but they didn't include it.Everything else about this computer is awesome. It's fast and very comfortable to type on and runs programs without issues. Not too much bloatware either.I'd recommend it.",0
(Its a great computer for gaming and productivity): Im in love with this computer the speed of the ssd is incredible psa i would recommend if you use a lottt of space to upgrade with a nv2ma for highers speeds and also try to get a larger battery the one included its good but could be better having in mind the hardware it has,0
"It feels loose and hollow, therefore it is very noisy, even with the slightest touch",0
"(MSI GL66 Laptop performance review): The product has a very good price ($1499) considering the components it contains, it has a very good value for money. The material of the upper case is aluminum and that of the lower case is plastic, although this does not affect performance, the materials are of good quality. It is a compact laptop considering that it is a gamer laptop, in addition to the performance when playing the game is very good, all the games tested on the laptop ran at maximum and without fps drops. Highly recommended if you want to invest in a laptop with good durability, especially for gaming. The battery does not have much durability, however, being a gaming laptop, the ideal is that it is always connected to the battery for maximum performance.",0
Its less than a quarter thick and can play most games on ultra settings.,0
bluetooth and wifi just don't work and the screen freezes until it gets back to a working temp.,0
"The keyboard does feel sturdy though and the back lighting is really customizable as are the graphics, fans, and different profiles (battery/performance/etc.)",0
"(Powerful laptop at a great price.): Pros:- Very powerful (Great for work such as graphic design and 3d editing. Can run games at max and RTX can be used)- Great screen- Steel series RGB keyboard- Plenty of ram that is also, user upgradeable (16gb)- Useful built in program for monitoring temps and changing modes, depending on use case.Cons:- Battery life (When in power saving mode you get about 3.5hrs, When gaming/resource heavy work you get 1hr)- Runs very hot (CPU hits max quite easily, GPU stays sufficiently cool)- Speakers are very basic",0
"(The device does not connect to wifi): I want to start by saying that I love the big screen and Microsoft office runs well on the computer, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why it is so fickle when it comes to wifi connectivity. Sometimes it connects to wifi with no problems, but other times it won't even register that there is wifi available let alone connect to it. It is incredibly frustrating and you probably need a computer that connects to the internet so I would not recommend this computer.",0
"(ugh....frustrating): I’m sooooo disappointed. I received it yesterday. It looks really great. However, I can’t even charge it, because the adapter doesn’t even fit the chromebook. 😖",0
(Perfect weight and size): Love my new chromebook. Does everything I need it to do. Perfect for school and travel.,0
"(Poor Quality Speakers and Screen): The speakers are nearly useless (I have mine turned to the loudest, and can barely hear movies). On Zoom, the speakers sound mushy as if people are talking with a mouthful of marshmallows. The screen quality is not great- the colors are grayed down and you have to have it tilted just so or the picture looks a little like a shadow-holograph.It is decent as far as speed goes. The Microsoft S program is awful, but it is pretty easy to remove. I am disappointed, but I needed a laptop immediately, since my other fell off a counter and broke. The delivery was excellent- a day earlier than expected.",0
"(Cant log in): Resetting the password is a PITA. It's almost as if they dont want you to use it,",0
"(Buyer Beware! Poor Manufacturing and QC!): This is my second MSI laptop within a month. First, I ordered PS63 which has several cosmetic issues, but I could not return it since I saw these cosmetic problems after upgrading the memory and ssd. This Prestige 15 unit also has a problem on the chassis. The lid of the laptop won't close completely. There is a serious amount of gap between the lid and the chassis (Please see the pictures). Furthermore, the lid and chassis are unaligned. While the right front side of the lid falls behind the chassis towards back, left front aligned okay. If you press further after closing the lid, lid still goes 3-5 mm down. Overall PC has very good specs to be honest, but you get a visually problematic device which bothers you. If I pay $1400 to this machine, I HAVE TO get the machine in a good condition. I am fed up with quality issues of MSI laptops. MSI! please listen up, your laptops should not be like winning a lottery. I am returning the laptop. And please do not send a generic response to this message like below because this message does not solve anything on the consumers' end! Instead, improve your Manufacturing and QC not to cause people lose time and effort.""Dear Valued Customer,We are sorry to hear about the issues you experienced with the lid...BLA BLA BLA BLA......... If you have any further questions regarding this product or have any suggestions for improvement for us, please do not hesitate to contact us directly at usrma@msi.com and we will be more than happy to assist you.Thanks for choosing MSI!""UPDATE:There are 2 NVMe Drivers, BUT each use PCIe x2 which means the speed is limited to max 1600-1700 MB/s. So even if you add a Samsung 970 Evo/Plus/Pro you cannot get 3500/3000 MB/s Read/Write Speeds. This product is totally misadvertised. You cannot find this detail anywhere.",0
"(Stopped working after 30 days): The laptop just stopped working after 30 days, it won't stay on without being plugged in and the keyboard works when it feels like.",0
(Love this LG Gram laptop!): Nothing to dislike about this computer. I am not a gamer. Had a 17 in 5 yr old Toshiba that was slowing down. This computer is so much fun. Takes only about 5 seconds to boot up. Used to wait 5 minutes. Very light and not a pain to pick up as most laptops are. Can handle the 5-G Wi-Fi technology and that may be why I now get 200+ internet speed when I was lucky to get 20 on the old laptop. SSD drive hardly ever heats up and when the fan does come on you can barely hear it. Well worth the extra money. Listed for $1999 but got it for $1399 on Cyber Monday. What a steal!,0
"(Garbage product and terrible customer service): I bought 2 of these over the summer for distance learning - I have 2 similarly aged kids who are on video calls for school 3 hours a day, usually simultaneously. The headphone jacks are defective - they rarely, and only intermittently, recognize when headphones are plugged in. Sometimes restarting the whole system will help, but not always. I've tried 3 sets, so it's obviously a hardware issue. I suspect it's a build defect, not a QC issue, since it's happening on both machines. Even when we need to use the external speakers, those are terrible, too - my kid can barely hear his teacher even hovered over the keyboard with the volume turned up to 100. What a total waste of money.",0
(battery life): battery life is too short. discharges within 2 hrs,0
(It was great): I liked a lot my laptop I have had it for more than a year. Everything works very good. Excellent processor. Super light to take it everywhere you go. Super slim. I really liked it.,0
(Bad): If I could give it less I would. Ordered one and there was a battery problem. Requested an exchange and the second one would not even start up. Sent it back.,0
"(Más que satisfecho con el rendimiento para edición de video.): Compré este equipo para edición de video, la verdad es que no he jugado un minuto en esta computadora. El rendimiento es excelente. Los colores del monitor sí cambian un poco cuando se comparan entre diferentes monitores. El precio que obtuve fue genial. Muy satisfecho con esta compra.",0
(Buena opción de chromebook): Me gustó la rapidez y la resistencia de l batería,0
(Crisp color): Great price for all the features,0
"(It came without a scratch): I have to say that i was pleased with what i got. I never bought a renewed product before. With the kids home from school because of the corvid-19 quarantine we needed another laptop for schooling. There isnt a scratch, nick, or blemish on it. The cord looks brand new. It works like new. It comes with a 1 year warranty which is great but i also got the extended warranty. Its pretty fast but a small screen at 14 in. Size doesnt seem to make a difference for me considering its for my 8 year old son. It may make a difference to others. I know its a hit or miss on the quality of the product you get when its renewed. I got lucky and I'm very happy with it.",0
(Good laptop. Bad service.): Laptop is solid. Just don’t expect any sort of help from Amazon customer service. They’re all garbage people.,0
The battery life seems to last forever.,0
"(Not what I expected): There is no touch screen, and there is no where to install DVD games like the sims. Beautiful laptop but can't play my games. Came beautifully packed with a storge case to keep dust and smoke off it. Just wish it could play the sims. Hopefully the part I need won't be expensive or difficult to install",0
"(Great general purpose laptop): This is the 4th one of these that I've bought! With it being all solid state, battery life is excellent. Startup is very fast. I've added a second SSD to two of them with no problems. It even comes with the necessary hardware to add it. It's not fast enough for intensive gaming but plenty fast for games like Minecraft, which the kids like. Being solid state also makes it quite rugged.",0
"(Info de RAM falsa): La verdad al principio me maravilló, luego vi que la ram era de 1600 y no 2400 y además la batería viene da?ada. Me entristece y decepciona que estafen con partes tan importantes como la RAM y la Batería.",0
"(A bit convoluted.): Update February 12, 2020: This is the worst laptop I have ever owned, and I have had a couple really crappy ones. Pretty sure that this laptop is officially dead, no warning other than one blue screen a day or so ago. Was turned away from it, with it plugged in and charging while I played a game on my xbox, turn back to check my cell phone and not a single light was on. Assumed maybe it came unplugged, maybe plug wasnt working, maybe its the cord.. long story short its none of those things its definitely the laptop. Never will I buy a MSI computer ever again. Not even sure I will ever touch the parts again. Not planning to contact the company because their customer service has been rude and unhelpful every time I have spoken to them about any of their products/services. I saw an affordable laptop, with decent specs from a name that seemed trusted in the tech community, and I went for it. Don't waste your money on their products. Please, maybe spend a little more on something from a brand with less issues. If this is how they handled this laptop with its issues when it was fresh to market, I can't imagine they behave any better about their newer models.I have really mixed feelings about this laptop. I like the design, and theoretically the stats are pretty good. In use, it doesn't work out quite so well. I knew I would need to upgrade the ram, but out of the box this computer has always been on the slower side. It can play some games fine but struggles with several. For example, multiplayer games like Terraria to games like Black Desert Online seem to make this laptop struggle to keep up. And no, its not my internet connection. My internet can handle 3 people streaming and two people playing mmo's without really breaking a sweat. On the laptop I lose frames, it freezes up now and then, crashes the games, and the fans kick on their high setting at a moments notice. Which are very very loud by the way. On the plus side, the laptop doesn't overheat much.The display is really poor quality. Trying to watch or play anything where the movie or game intends it to be dim or look like night time is pretty bad because it all starts to look the same. I have tried to adjust these settings with the programs provided but it seems to not make much of a difference.The battery life on this is awful, but I knew that when I bought it. It doesn't take a year to charge up, so I don't gripe much on it. However, the location and charger style is incredibly inconvenient. A laptop meant for gamers, in a world where the majority is right handed, puts one usb slot on the right side not far from the charge port, where the cord design lines up the charger cord to run along the side of the laptop. Plug-in mouse setup can be annoying because I either have to fix the charger to point out the back (which would be fine if it weren't for the point of laptops to be travel) or it overlaps my mouse usb and the charge cord aomwtimes will get in the way. Its a minor design annoyance, but I felt was worth mentioning.Last but not least, the built in camera is useless. First, it tries to make you pay for the ability to use the camera because it doesnxt come already registered or with a code for the software that makes the camera operable. I sought assistance on the MSI site and felt treated a little rudely when offered a solution. The solution was a little convoluted but worked, where I also felt like I had been thrown back in time to my old baseball sized logitech webcam from when I was a kid. I live decently far from family so skype calls are important to me so I can catch up with them and see how they are. The camera quality is rough. And then, amusingly enough, the camera stopped working again entirely. It doesn't detect that I have one, regardless of installing or uninstalling drivers or anything else. The whole camera saga really irritated me. It decided not to exist right before a discord D&D session. Embarassing and frustrating to go through all the crap to make the camera work (This is how it is shipped by the way, not an accident in set up or anything! They literally put webcam hardware in the laptop that they don't bother having registered the software. I've never experieced this in my life, so it boggles my mind that this is standard for this laptop) only to have it become useless again. So if cameras aren't that important, I suppose don't worry about it. Or if they are and you have your heart set on this laptop, just save yourself the frustration and buy a camera to plug in.On the plus side, I enjoy the size, shape, weight, and design of the laptop. I appreciate the cooling abilities. MSI is a company I generally like a lot, and I don't feel like this laptop represents the quality of their company as a whole. With a little love, patience, and a chunk of money I can fix most of the issues I have with this computer. My bone to pick is that when you buy a laptop like this, you shouldn't have to go through all this when most other laptops (Especially with this pricetag) work as intended right out of the box. I've owned and worked with laptops ranging from crappy tiny netbooks to macbook pros. These are problems I only ever encountered on low end computers, except the camera. That was a doozy, and a new one for me.Oh! Advice in regards to the harddrivev before you set anything else up after you get it up and running, change the drive locations of your folders like Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc. Use the main hard drive mostly for the operating system (sincr its small) and put everything else on the secondary drive. That is how it is intended and will save you drom MSI alerts constantly telling you your HD is full. I forgot a couple times and installed things on the main HD instead and the pop ups were a mild nuisance.If i find better solutions for some of these problems, I will update my review with how I got it fixed. I bought this laptop in February 2018, Reviewing it November 2018.",0

"(I've owned this for 2 years. It's a mediocre laptop and the software has a few bugs.): I spent hours looking for an affordable laptop with a long battery life.

It cannot run moderately intensive programs while on this.On the bright side, it hasn't degraded much compared to other batteries.The Software:It randomly shuts down once a month. Luckily it's 2020 and every program saves itself, but wow it's annoying.Random websites and programs don't work for me, while they work for other PC and mac users.Sound:I'm not picky about sound but this is too quiet.

"(Just awesome for the money! Read for a few important details...): UPDATE: For anyone who doubted that the mobo in the 2022 version of this laptop supported Gen 4 SSD's, you can put those doubts to rest. I received, installed and tested the 1tb Gen 4 Micron 3400 series SSD that I ordered. The drive is rated to achieve 6600 read and 5000 write. Chrystal Disk tests mine out at 6545.55 read and 4934.03 write. The only way that I could realize the top speeds of my new Micron Gen 4 SSD is if the Mobo supported Gen 4 SSD's. So there you have it. Just be aware that a Gen 4 SSD in a Gen 4 mobo will run hotter than a Gen 3 SSD in a Gen 4 mobo. To make matters a bit worse, there isnt a lot of room inside this laptop for air flow. This may be why the manufacturer of the 2022 version used a Gen 3 SSD instead of a Gen 4 SSD. This is by no means an insurmountable problem. Just make sure that you shop for a decent M.2 SSD heat sink at the same time that you're shopping for that new ultra fast Gen 4 SSD. Ive used a 1mm thick graphene coated copper plate, on top of a 1mm thick silicone pad on top of a 0.07mm thick layer of graphene tape. This may be overkill but I dont want to waste even a single, brief worry on how hot my drive might be getting lol! I see the price of the laptop went up a bit. Its still a bargain!The GTX 980ti GPU in my old, self built desk top gaming system died last January and Ive been ""slumming it"" with a Radeon 7770 ever since because, after COVID hit, the price of seriously game worthy graphics cards shot up beyond what I was willing to pay. This laptop didnt cost much more than a really good graphics card so I finally decided to retire the ole' desktop and buy this laptop. So far(after two days, mind you lol), Im very happy that I did.First, let me straighten out one big issue. I AM REVIEWING THE 2022 Model! NOT THE 2021 Model! I asked a couple of questions about my 2022 system in the customer question area and mostly got replies from well-meaning folk who own the 2021 model. Unfortunately for those who bought the 2021 model a year ago or less for the same or greater money, the 2022 model is a significant upgrade and has some features which do not apply to the 2021 model. Many answers supplied by 2021 model owners cannot be applied to 2022 model owners. Its surely a fact that Ill be in the same boat as the 2021 model owners come 2023. Thats just how tech growth works.Anyway, the 2022 model uses ddr5 ram(2021 model uses DDR4) and has no problem mixing 1xr8 ram with 2xr8 ram. If you dont know the difference between the two, here is what little I know: They are essentially the same except that 1xr8 ram is one sided. 2xr8 ram is two sided. From what I understand, smaller sticks of ram will usually be 1xr8 while larger sticks(32gb and up) will usually be 2xr8. Some motherboards will not let you mix single sided ram with double sided ram. The mobo on the 2022 system will and from what Ive read in the reviews, so will the mobo on the 2021 system, so thats great. I added 32gb 2xr8 Samsung ram to my 2022 model for a system recognized total of 40gb. Ill be removing the remaining stock 8gb ram and replacing it with another 32gb stick in the beginning of Oct, when my new budget starts. That will bring my system to 64gb ram which I ""think"" is the max. IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2022 system comes with two slots for ram and has an 8gb stick in each slot. Both 8gb sticks of ram can be removed and replaced. NO RAM IS SOLDERED TO THE MOBO IN THE 2022 MODEL.Ok, next and also very important; The m.2 PCIe SSD interface on the 2022 motherboard is GEN 4(also awesome!). This was verified by the seller who has been excellent about very quickly responding to questions in the question-and-answer area for this product. The 2021 model mobo uses a GEN 3 PCIe interface. The difference between GEN 3 and GEN 4 in how fast info can be processed can be huge, depending upon the SSD you use. Put a Gen 3 SSD in a Gen 4 capable system and you'll be limited to the processing speeds of the Gen 3 SSD. Put a Gen 4 SSD in a Gen 3 system and the Gen 3 system will limit your Gen 4 SSD to Gen 3 speeds. But put a Gen 4 SSD in a GEN 4 capable system and you're gonna get the fastest speeds possible for that drive in that system.Unfortunately, the 512gb SSD included in the 2022 system is a Gen 3 Hynix. So, despite the system having a GEN 4 PCIe interface, the included SSD drive limits info transfer/access to GEN 3 speeds. The speeds of the installed Gen 3 SSD are nothing to sneeze at though. The read/write on mine were; read-3555.98 write-2707.89 and 2557.70 and 2581.43. Considering that a large number of Gen 3 SSD's proudly claim numbers significantly lower than those, the installed Hynix drive is pretty decent. But also consider that a high end GEN 4 drive like a Samsung 980 pro claim numbers TWICE those!There are two slots on the 2022 systems mobo for an m.2 SSD. One has the previously mentioned Hynix SSD already installed and that contains the laptops OS. Ive installed a gen 3 VisionTek SSD into the second m.2 slot on my laptops mobo. Its just a drive I had kicking around. I got a GEN 4, 1tb Micron 3400 series drive for a very good price and will be transferring my OS to that when it arrives in a few days. The Gen 4 micron SSD claims speeds of over 6000 read and over 5000 write as long as its in a mobo that is GEN 4 capable. Ill remove the preinstalled Hynix SSD and replace it with the much faster Micron SSD as my OS disk. Ill probably stash the Hynix SSD safely away somewhere, OS intact, as a backup in case the Micron drive ever dies for some reason. Finally, Ill probably leave the VisionTek drive in the 2nd M.2 slot and use it strictly for game storage.Im not sure what else that I can add that someone might find useful. Everything Ive written so far is stuff I had wished someone else would've listed somewhere in the reviews or question and answer area. I had to do a serious bit of research to figure it out on my own. Ive only had this system for a couple of days now but Ive been using it ever since it arrived(its so nice to have a fully functional system again, that is capable of running everything I like to run with ease!). I cant comment on battery life or heat issues since I keep my laptop plugged in 99% of the time and keep it on a laptop cooling pad whenever in use. There are options to limit the charge of the battery to 60%(or 80% if you so choose) which is supposed to drastically increase the overall life of the battery but again, such options are only applicable if you use the laptop plugged in most of the time-which I do. There are simply a whole lot of features for configuring the system to your needs and likings. To go through them all would be to make this review into more of a book that I already have so Im gonna stop here.This is a great system for the money. If I were you, Id grab it while you can.",0

"(It way better than you expect): Great price for the power it has. I was recommended to buy the Razer Blade 15 Base Gaming Laptop, although they claim it's the best gaming laptop, it was way more expensive and less powerful than my new GL65 Leopard. I'm glad I bought this amazing laptop, it runs almost every game flawlessly, at least games from 2020 and before, lets see how it holds up with New Gen games. And it supports VR too. Besides from gaming I use this laptop to work, video editing, 3D animation, coding.",0
"(Dell XPS Love and hate relationship): First off, Let start off by saying how amazing the quality of this machine build and looks. It very things and with the USB C implemented it even more lightweight than before. The machine it self has good specs but a little steep in prices but for the portability you can't complaint. The facial recognition built in works very well and even faster than surface book 2 I might add in term of finding my face and login.Cons:This laptop will over heat from simple task just from opening fix fox. Which is very unfortunate considering idle temp averages around 65 sometime gets to 50C but you have to be like doing nothing. Which aren't very impressive number especially when running anything that uses a little bit of CPU the temp jumps to 87C + even 90C.Fixes: In-order to remedies this issue I have conducted two things, I applied thermal padding on original heat stinks to help with the heat transfer and I also re-paste the factory thermal paste. I have seen a dramatic increase in term of temperature of CPU. I now idle around 45-50C consistently and max temps reach is 85 without exceeding it. I believe that is a win win situation if you ask me for me opinion.*I also highly recommend remove all of dell bloat wares... they are causing high cpu usage the moment you boot up the laptop which result throttling and high temp. I removed everything as they aren't needed. Trust me.Touch-screen is amazing works and beautiful keyboard layout and material. Track pad responsive and better than the first generation of xps 13.Highly recommend if you fix address the CPU temp.",0
"(Piece of garbage): I ordered this product Feb of 2020. I had read reviews that the battery runs down fast, but mistakenly thought, not a big deal, I keep it at home, near the charger, it's just for light use. What I didn't realize is that the charger would die after a year and a half (which I replaced on my own dime,) followed by the actual battery before even 2 years. Back to repair shop but definitely too many problems within a short amount of time and a truly cheap, crap product.",0
"(I’m very happy with my Chromebook!): I’m very happy with this Chromebook. I bought it for the sole purpose of writing and it’s exactly what I need, since I use Google Drive for everything. It fits in my purse and has excellent battery life. Exactly as described and it got here fast.",0
"(Excellent Laptop For the Price): I love this laptop. I am using it mainly for my school work, I do full time classes at university and some are online. I needed something light and fast that I could travel with. If you are looking for something that is a powerhouse laptop at this price point you are fooling yourself. I am surprised I got this good of a deal on a laptop with a SSD in it. I bought this laptop with the mindset that I wanted something that was fast and could do a light work load because I have a powerhouse gaming Desktop PC at home, so I did not need something over the top in a laptop. I also wanted it to be light for travel. If you are looking for something that will run High FPS Games or Adobe products smoothly I 100% don't recommend this PC. This computer can handle simple games, I like to play My Time at Portia and it can run League of Legends, but most potatoes can, so it's not a gaming PC by any means, but you need to check the Games themselves and see the lowest setting you can run them on (Like you should if you are a gamer and wanting a new laptop).The size of the SSD is not the greatest, so if you do not use things like Google doc's that save to the cloud you will be wanting to get an external drive or an SD card. I believe you can install a HDD on here, but am unsure and do not plan to myself. I have a 1TB external drive for if I need to move files between computers and as a general rule of just having my files backed up to several places.Pros:- Boots up in seconds- Runs smooth for everyday light use, Internet Browsing, Watching Youtube, Hulu, Netflix- Plays some games that don't need high graphics cards or processors- SD card slot so I can extend storage if need be- Has an Ethernet Port and a HDMI port if you travel and want to put something on the bad hotel TV'sCons:- The Bloatware, so dumb and useless- No others right nowAgain my review is based on this product at this price point. I didn't expect this PC to run a graphics intensive Game, I would never expect a 400$ laptop to do so. I love that it came with an SSD, the storage is fine for my needs as I mainly use Google Docs for school and have an external drive. I have had no issues with the Wi-fi on the laptop as of yet, I do not expect to. If you are looking for a laptop that will offer you speed and be a great travel companion if you are in college or travel for work, you should get this one.Last thing I do recommend installing a fresh version of Windows 10 so you don't get the bloatware, or you can just uninstall the bloatware through Programs and Features. Up to you, but the bloatware you will get with almost any new Laptop.",0
"(Great computer!): This review is for Acer Swift 3 SF314-54-56L8, 14"" Full HD, 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8250U, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, Windows 10, Silver.This is my 3rd Acer Swift 3. It is even better than the previous! Beautiful design with much thinner bezel. It's super fast, with lots of features, such as back lit keyboard and fingerprint scanner. It's all metal and yet very light (around 3 lbs). It also charges fast and the battery lasts for hours. Has HDMI, USB-C, 1 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0, memory card reader, Bluetooth, 802.11ac wireless, full HD, stereo speakers, webcam, and headphone jack. The speakers are at the bottom, so if using it over a pillow or lap it could muffle the sound. It has one headset jack, like those on most smartphones. You can use it with regular headphones or with headphones with in-line microphone. Laptop also has microphone. It doesn't get hot, not even after hours of use. Has more than enough storage for me.

(Excellent computer.): I was looking for a computer for everyday use and used to have a MacBook Pro. After 8 years it was time for an upgrade but I don’t want to spend MacBook money. This laptop is AWESOME! It’s fast and does everything I need. I have the 64GB version and have no issues with storage even excluding the 256GB micro sd card I bought. Adjusting to the google apps from the Microsoft office suite took a little time but I could do everything I want. My only critique is that the computer cant connect on airplanes because most airline apps aren’t configured for the chrome book but that seems like an easy fix as more people buy them.,0
(I would definitely reorder love my Acer and my kids love it too): Absolutely love the Acer laptop. No issues,0
"High-end specs include great CPU, ample memory, and disk space on SSD.",0
(Not good): Too slow,0
"(Extremely Disappointed): I bought this in 2017 for my mom, I have a similar Acer of the same price, the difference is the SSD. I wanted more space, so I decided to just get a regular hard drive, monumental mistake. It runs at about 10% the speed as my other Acer, which once again is the same price, I still use and love. Also, it is 2020 now and as technology advances, things become outdated quickly. That's not to say the previous technology is bad, it's just that the new ones tend to be better and with identical pricing or cheaper. If you're looking for a laptop without breaking the bank let me save you a lot of time and recommend one. I have built quite a few PCs and am pursuing a master's in data science, so I know a bit about computers. Check out the HP 15-dy1036nr, its specifications are nothing short of phenomenal for the price of $599.99. Granted I haven't bought or used it, I'm purely speaking from a hardware standpoint, it comes with 8 GB DDR4-2666 SDRAM, Intel® Core i5-1035G1 which benchmarks twice as well as the CPU on this Acer, and 256 GB PCIe® NVMe M.2 SSD which by the way are the newer SSD's that read/write at 7 times the previous generation SSD's which were already blazing fast to begin with. The laptop has two downsides, it does not come with an optical drive, which is outdated but still could prove to be an inconvenience at one point, however, it's unlikely that'll you ever need it. The second downside is that the laptop comes with a virus by the name of McAfee, uninstall it as soon as you get it. If you need an antivirus, I recommend Malwarebytes, you can get a two-week trial on the premium version to test it, I had premium for around five years, but honestly, the free version should be more than enough.Also, if you're looking for a powerful computer and don't need the mobility of a laptop just build it yourself, you can build one for half the price you would get from a brand such as Alienware. It is also a neat and fun skill to have, watch a couple of YouTube videos, or read some articles to learn how. It really is not difficult; I can build one in about 20 minutes.I acknowledge that this review probably contains the use of poor grammar or incorrect punctuation. I have avoided English classes like the plague my whole life, with that being said it’s probably not the greatest analogy since it seems that people don't avoid the plague at all considering my experiences with Covid.-September 2020",0

It will go at 100% for no reason then not run during hard performance. Configurations don't help, sadly. Just a pack of really bad quality control issues. If you purchase this thing, prepare to deal with an incredibly annoying return process and time without a computer to deal with the issues.",0
"(Good product, so far): I have been using Mac for a decade. The new job requested to have a M.S. hence I bought this one from Amazon. Nice one. The only thing is that I have chosen it 15” and this is the first lab top i get it that big which looks a bet weird. But it seems very handy and light. There is no light to show the cap lock is on or off. May be just because I am used to the Mac. The speed and the performance looks satisfactory but it has been only few days with me. Wish it will last.",0
(Nice laptop): I use it for gaming but have to keep charger attached as battery life is awful.,0
"(Excellent laptop for the money.): Best feature is that with a 14"" display it's not as big and bulky as the more common 16"" laptops, but still a good size keyboard and overall features.

It's very thin and lightweight, the screen is huge, and is appealing looks wise. It's very fast, and seems to be a pretty powerful little computer. We absolutely love these and are so glad to have purchased these.There is only one thing that I reeeeaaaally can't stand. The speakers are on the BOTTOM of the computer, so even when the volume is turned up to 100 it always sounds muffled...even on a tabletop surface.But, other than this minor thing we highly recommend these.",0
"(Probably the best laptop I ever owned!): This MSI is quite the little powerhouse, it runs any game I throw at it at a steady 60 FPS with max graphical settings. I initially stress tested it with Doom Eternal, and it was as though I was playing it on my desktop. If there were any differences they were so negligible I didn't notice.On top of that with the 16 gigs of ram as opposed to 8 gigs, which is usually put into gaming laptops, makes multitasking during gameplay a non issue. Whether you're recording gameplay, or listening to spotify, or both!The MSI is also built with metal casing unlike some of it's competitors, such as the Acer Razor, which is pure plastic. This gives it a sturdy feel, and adds a bit of protection.Now, I did say this is a powerhouse so it does suck battery life rather fast. Granted there are options to conserve power, but even then at the very, very most you may get half a dozen hours, but more likely closer to four, or five. This for me isn't a deal breaker since I generally have a power socket nearby, and when I do not it's only for and hour or two max.I will also point out that this machine gets hot, real hot the harder you push it. So I highly suggest using a cooling pad with it.Other than that it's been running magnificently over the last few weeks since I got it. If you're looking for a really good gaming laptop, this is worth the price, and then some.I highly recommend!",0
(Customer Service is horrendous): Three weeks after I bought this laptop I started having issues with the D drive. All the icons would just disappear from the main screen. I'd have to restart my computer. This was not acceptable for my work. I tried to return the laptop. I bought it off Amazon and it came through BrownBox so there was zero customer service. They could NOT have cared less. I will never purchase an item like that on Amazon again.,0
"(This laptop is almost new and has stopped working.): Money wasted on this computer, just stopped working. Never buy another one!!!!",0
"(Stopped Working After 7 Months): This Chromebook was fine at first. It was an adjustment to do the initial switch (moving from having lots of files stored on a PC to suddenly going cloud-only for everything), but that was expected. And it was a hassle to learn how to print and scan documents, but eventually, that got sorted out, too. But all of a sudden one day, after owning it for 7 months, the computer just wouldn't start up anymore. One day it worked; the next day, it didn't. Now we have to pay to have someone diagnose the problem and tell us how expensive it will be to fix. I really expected the laptop to last longer without a major problem like this.",0

"(Multiple issues after 5 months of light use.): The battery monitoring module died around 5 months, the computer was unable to be turned on unless plugged into the well adapter. Lenovo customer support was great and quickly repaired. However, one day after using it from getting it back from Lenovo the fan died and the computer began to over heat. I'm glad this isn't my main computer.Updated: (3 years later) Don't buy this computer. It's too small to handle the heat of the I5 7200U in it. The performance is just awful when it shouldn't be with having an I5. The terrible performance is due to the lack of proper cooling. The fan is very loud and runs full speed at idle. Spend the extra few hundred and get a surface pro.",0
the GPU runs pretty cool,0
"(Two Stars): Not satisfied, slower than expected, and battery gets discharged within less than 1/2 hour",0
"(Can't see the keys in many lighting conditions): Beautiful, high functioning laptop but you cannot see the keys in many light conditions - the surface of the keyboard is gorgeous, however the keys are painted with a light gold color that disappears, making it very DIFFICULT TO SEE the keyboard. The computer was super light, fast and had a nice look/feel. Had to return it and get a EVO from another mfr. Bummer.",0
(Chromebook): Buen producto. Algunos problemas al instalar o usar ciertas aplicaciones al no contar con sistema Microsoft.Funciona mayormente como una tableta y eso te permite un uso sencillo.,0
"(Good for the price, good introductory gaming computer.): Being the first gaming computer I've experienced, I don't have much to compare it to, but it definitely looks and feels nice to use. Fairly fast and smooth. The only issues would be unrelated to the computer itself and moreso with the operating system; most of the issues other reviewers had with the GPUs and such are easily fixable if you know where to look.",0
(Do NOT Buy): The screen of the laptop came broken. Returned it weeks ago and have yet to receive a refund.,0
"(read before buying): The item is as described. It's just wonderful laptop. Screen is most amazing thing in this laptop, they say it's 144hz and 300nits but from my point of view nits are more than 300... maybe 330 or 320. Only thing I wish was more better is battery. DO NOT EXPECT to have 6-7 hours battery life, you will just get 3-4 hours while doing normal tasks. If you start gaming you will definitely need a charger. What is more, keyboard is very smooth and fells great when typing and backlight makes it even better. Overall, to be honest this is BEST laptop in this budget, of course you can find more powerful laptops than this but it will cost you double or triple money. So if you have budget of 1000$ I recommend this one, you won't regret.and one more thing, it looks awesome in real life than in photos.",0
(Beautifull and powerful): Completely satisfied,0
"(Will not purchase again): The laptop is a standard laptop, no extras which is what I needed. Two weeks into owning the laptop, the WiFi completely disappeared off it and all the computer was detecting was a LAN. I factory reset the computer and all was fine for two more weeks, when I woke up and did it again. Had to send back the computer for a full refund, luckily I was still in the window for returning it.",0
(Good Product): So far this computer works great ... i am happy with my purchase,0

"(A good computer for the money.): I'm a HP fan. Since my current Pavilion dv7-6b55dx Entertainment laptop is nearing its life expectancy, I wanted to replace it before serious issues occurred. The new Pavilion is comparable to my older model, but much faster. However, all computers slow down with age. The old Pavilion seemed lightening fast when I first got it. It's a fair replacement. However, there is one issue that is a major disappointment. The battery is internal and not removable. Since I use this computer for my business, in place of a desktop, I like to remove the battery and keep the laptop plugged in 24/7. This is not possible with the new Pavilion. So, I have to use it till the battery runs down and plug it in again, Then repeat. Bummer! Also, the case is flimsy compared to my older Pavilion. Much lighter gauge plastic. Really don't expect the new Pavilion to last nearly as long as the old one",0
(very fast): very fast for most simple of how i use. not for gaming. only silly apps. not can do steam or that like,0
"(Good price on a general purposed laptop): Great laptop for general purpose tasks like homework or video streaming. Not for extreme gaming, but will run flash games well. Used mine for note taking and homework assignments, great battery life.",0
"(The new update sucks): We bought the laptop in Dec 2021. After a couple of weeks, it had a big OS update: Big Sur to Monterey. The problems started happening - I kept getting locked out, passwords not working, account name not working - resulting to my having to run to the Mac Service Center 2x.The first time they said the update caused some issues. Second one said, it was a file vault issue.Also, noticed how since the update my battery life has decreased. The tech guys said this is normal after an update due to the machine still settling and should stabilize soon. It's been a couple of weeks and still the same. I've even heeded the advice of not logging out nor shutting down, just folding the laptop, to let the machine keep working on the kinks. Also because it's an M1 technology so no need to formally shut it down like a PC.Not sure of what's really going on, tbh.Perhaps it is due to Apples newest OS being buggy, or it could be the unit is a lemon. Not sure. But giving it one last chance and if it fails me again before the 90 day warranty is up, I am returning it.",0

"(Quality doesn't last long.): Sadly, this computer has stopped working. We have tried everything to fix the problem. Our warranty has expired. For something that costs as much as this computer did, and for what it was used for, it hasn't lasted long. Very disappointed with this product.",0
"(Numerous quality issues): We got this unit quickly, but as soon as we turned it on we noticed two horizontal blemishes on the middle of the screen. We might have been able to live with those, but then we discovered the left mouse button was defective and often or usually failed to work. Then we found that even though it has a fingerprint reader, the option to set up fingerprint sign-in was not available in the Control Panel, rather it said it was unavailable. Then we decided to return it and wanted to reset the PC, but when we tried to do it, we got a message that no recovery environment was found. That's multiple strikes. Hoping this vendor can do better on the replacement unit. I will say that the external appearance of the very good overall.",0
"(This is a great computer. It's not got all of the GPU ...): This is a great computer. It's not got all of the GPU power that a bigger computer would have, but it does a great job. It's a bit disappointing to not have an optical drive, but it boots fast and runs fast.",0

"(Good.): To put this in layman's terms:... It's really just a tablet with a keyboard and a touchpad.Pros:-Keys feel really, really nice. They're quiet which is a plus in my book.-Keys light up. Good for night owls like me.-Battery lasts an average of 6 hours on full usage. E.g: watching movies, streaming, listening to music, charging cell phone.-ChromeOS: I'm a big fan of the sleek design of Google's OS. Fast and easy navigation.Cons:-It's just a tablet with a keyboard and touchpad.-The screen hinges don't hold the screen up well enough. If I push the screen back to a 45 degree angle the screen will just flop over after typing for a few seconds. Wish they would tighten those hinges.4/5 Good. Wish I would've went with the M5 processor, though.",0
(using the laptop for work): i love it and i use it more for working meeting and checking the email. using the laptop to checking the what to make every night,0
(Fantastic Crispy Screen): First thing I have to say is the speedy delivery of Amazon. It took 4 days for me to get the laptop including Sat. and Sunday. Mind you I am 5000 miles away from Amazon depot.The setup is pretty easy except it took me over 2 hrs to work with the outlook for my several mail account. Finally I switch to Google mail and all setup in a few minutes.The machine is super fast and it bypass my usb boot even I disable the fast boot. Overall I enjoy with this new machine.,0

"(Find a better laptop): Final Fantasy 14 or wow classic cannot be run on this computer without being plugged in, it's ridiculous, I've used way cheaper computers and they are able to run those games without having to be plugged in just fine. the battery life is also not great. I am very disappointed at the price i paid for this laptop and have this happen. if you are considering buying this laptop, do your research and find one that is better that way you don't have to be plugged in 24/7 whenever you want to game. Asus crate is also very disappointed, some of the options don't work when it comes down to customizing the lighting around the laptop.... Overall, just look for a better computer this one doesn't seem to do simple things easy, just makes your life harder and frustrating.",0
"(I have no complaints): After a few months of use I have to say I am happy with the purchase for the price. Initially, the order said it would take 3 months to arrive but after seeing it listed for $100 less from another seller, I was able to cancel my order for no cost and order the same computer that arrived in less than a week. The computer is as fast as I need it to be, light, and the keyboard “flex” that some people mentioned doesn’t bother me at all.",0
(Nothing but a pile of junk.): I have had had this HP since April 2019. I can't use it. It won't boot to anything and all it does is shut on and off by itself. I've tried everything. I looked up what things I could do to try and remedy this but nothing worked. It has a permanent battery which I didn't realize for some time. I am taking it to a comp tech tomorrow. I sure hope it doesn't cost a fortune to fix if it is indeed fixable. I'm so disappointed. I really liked the computer it was so fast and easy to use. I don't think I'll purchase another HP,0

"(Excellent Value(8th Gen), Perfect for Students and Those on a Budget): The ASUS Zenbook ux330ua(8th gen) is an excellent value. As a CS graduate student, I needed something that could handle a heavy coding workload while still being portable enough to bring to class and not break the bank. This fit the bill perfectly, and I highly recommend it to students or anyone who wants a premium ultrabook experience at a budget-friendly price.Display 5/5:This is one the best displays you will find on a device under $1000. 100% sRGB coverage is a must have for me. As someone who does a moderate amount of graphics coding and web design, I need to know the colors on my screen are accurate. For those who don't use this device for content creation, you will still enjoy the vivid colors, respectable black levels, and sharp 1080p resolution. The matte display also prevents distracting reflections. Note: There was no noticable backlight bleeding on my unit. It's there if you look for it, but you would be hard pressed to notice it in any real use case scenario. This is not a fault of ASUS as this is typical for IPS displays in general. I also did not have any dead pixels.Keyboard 4/5:The keyboard is respectable if not remarkable. The keys have good travel but are slightly mushy. My unit will sometimes fail to detect when keys are pressed near their corners. The layout is fine, and the half height arrow keys are surprisingly very usable. This keyboard will not remind you of a ThinkPad, but it will get the job done and has held up well to my coding sessions.Audio 5/5:The audio is excellent for a an ultrabook in this price range. It probably won't fill a large conference room, but the built-in speakers are perfect for online lecture videos or the occasional Amazon Prime video.Build Quality 4/5:This device can't quite hold up to the industry leaders like the Surface Laptop, MacBook, ThinkPad, or XPS products. However, those devices are in other price category entirely. At the current price, it certainly outshines the competition, namely the Acer Swift. The chassis is lightweight, and the spun aluminum finish is a beautiful touch. There is a small amount of flex around the keyboard and screen areas. However, I wouldn't consider it to be durability concern.Battery Life 5/5:The battery life was a major selling pont for me. I am getting 8-10 hours depending on usage. As a student on the go, being able to work all day on one charge is a game changer and should be industry standard by now.Performance 5/5:The quad core Intel i5 8250u processor has excellent performance and represents a huge jump from the previous generation's dual core. Pairing this CPU with 8GB of ram and a 256GB SSD, this device will remain a solid performer for years to come. I can easily run a Linux VM to do any work I can't do on Windows. and the performance is superb. The graphics processor is an integrated Intel UHD 620. While this won't be suitable for any heavy gaming, it is perfectly suited for light graphics work, video watching, and displaying to external monitors. You can even play some older or less demanding video games at respectable settings(CounterStrike: GO, Half-Life 2, etc.).Overall 5/5:This is an excellent ultrabook for those on a budget. If you are still reading at this point, there is a good chance you should go ahead and buy this product. You won't be disappointed. For those with a bit more wiggle room in their budget, take a look at the Zenbook ux410 and ux430. Those devices manage to fit a 14"" screen in the same chassis by using smaller bezels around the display.Additional Comments:This device is highly compatable with Linux. I have had no issues with any distro I have tried. I can confirm it works flawlessly with Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, and with elementaryOS 0.4.",0

"(Great little laptop for kids): As my children get older, they have more and more projects and things that would require a laptop (plus games...let's be honest). I am never thrilled when they use mine and was happy to get this one for a great price. The screen quality is nothing to write home about, but they are typing up reports and playing online puzzled etc...nothing more is really needed. Sturdy, solid chromebook with no unnecessary bells and whistles. Very happy with this purchase",0

"(Laptop rocks, and Acer support rocks): This has been a really great laptop, no issues with it, it runs top tier games at full graphics quality without a hitch and with other programs running in the background. The one tiny problem I did have was with the printing wearing away on a single key on the keyboard, and I contacted Acer support and asked them to send me a new keyboard and they did! Also in case you've had horror experiences with the battery replacement process on other gaming laptops, I checked before I bought this one and the battery is really easy to replace. The keyboard is designed in a way that I think will keep small particles from getting stuck under them, and the keys are easy to replace if you have the same problem I did with the printing wearing off. It's also really nice to have a keyboard with a full numpad on a laptop.",0
"(Faulty Product. Wish I could get a refund): I'm not happy at all with this product, it broke within a couple months.

Will definitely spend the extra dollars for higher quality electronics in the future.",0
(exactly what i wanted): excellent! lightweight.,0
"(Slow(er) performance than expected, low(er) volume compared to other units, okay for basic browsing): Purchased this unit because of dissatisfaction with Lenovo Flex 11 which was purchased first. I will post a separate review for the Lenovo Flex. Unfortunately the main positives of this Samsung unit compared to the Lenovo Flex is its 64GB eMMC hard drive (the Flex only has 32GB capacity) and the micro SDHC card slot works (I have a 128GB card inserted which does not stick out but is flush against the side of this unit) whereas I could not successfully insert any SD card into the card reader of the Flex. Also, for the Flex it appeared that any SD card inserted would still have one third to half of the card sticking out which would make it less than ideal as a permanent way to expand it onboard 32GB eMMC memory. The screen on this unit is passable but not as sharp or vivid as the screen on the Flex. The onboard speakers is extremely disappointing. With volume set to 50%, the sound from the Flex is robust and sufficiently loud to watch videos or listen to music without resorting to earphones. However on this Samsung unit, when volume is set at 50%, the sound is faint(er) and less clear. In order to achieve the same audio experience of the Flex, I had to increase the volume to over 80% if I wanted to listen to sounds coming from the speakers. Can’t speak to whether the same problem exists when using earphones as I have not plugged in and used earphones on either units. Overall I am disappointed with the performance of this unit even though it technically “works” and does everything one would expect from a Chromebook. Only reason why I even bothered to buy this unit (and the Lenovo Flex 11 from a different online retailer, the one which ends in egg) is because my Toshiba Chromebook is getting old (but actually performs better than either of these two newer units) and my Google Chromebook Pixel (2013 model) is no longer able to receive the newest Chrome OS updates but also still performs better than either of these two units. Ending on a positive note, the Google Play Store works fine for both this Samsung unit and the Lenovo Flex. Had no problem installing my go-to Android apps onto either unit (e-readers, Chinese dictionary, video players with more features than what Chromebooks can normally do/play). On side note, did have to purchase a cover (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GNE4QMO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) because this Samsung unit felt too flimsy to carry around in my backpack without something to protect it from scratches and nicks. The iPearl mCover hard shell case fits well (even if I do think it’s somewhat pricey for what it is).",0

Well yes ,not serious ones .Too few USB's only 2 ,I always had 3 and miss the extra one.The keys are ok ,only ok ,not excited about them.Also I thought the keyboard was backlit,well ttheyr'e not..Despite those negatives ,I think I will really love this computer .I think you will too.I'm glad I waited for the 8th generation ,it's great.1/14/2018 :After using this for a couple of weeks ,I have simmered down a bit.First I wish the screen was a little sharper and being a small screen it gets a little hard to read the lettering.I also notice that the sound while ok ,is not too great.I'm comparing this Zen to a Lenovo ideapad which is 6 or 7 years old,much sharper, better sound ,but almost twice as heavy.I notice it is (kinda) backlit ,again not as well backlit as the Lenovo .I will say the Lenovo cost $200 more than the Zen.What I appreciate most is the 7 second boot time and the long battery life.2/2/2018An update.I got a scare a week ago.I got a black screen ,it wouldn't boot.I kept trying turning of and on for an hour.Eventually it started to work again.I did a restore point.The only problem with buying a computer online is ,it's not easy to return.Prices are better on Amazon but unlike Best Buy you can't drive and return it.Food for thought.7/6/2018AN UPDATE: After more than 6 months ,I want to alert you about this computers shortcomings.There are two big ones.The sound system is bad ,I cant hear hardly anything the sound is so low at full settings.Tech support put in new drivers which did nothing ,very disappointed .I would advise not buying this computer on this alone.The second issue ,the keyboard is crap and was crap from the day I took delivery .It has what is called sticky keys .Meaning when typing you have to go back to enter missing letters.NOT GOOD.",0
(Happy Camper): Purchased this to take to school. Good quality product with very long battery life!,0
"(Easy to use , slim takes very little space on my desk): I am in love with my lap top , slim and very easy to use .",0
"(the screens suck. I wish I would not have bought this ...): so many damn fingerprints on this thing, and it's weird because they don't come off. Also, the screens suck. I wish I would not have bought this honestly.",0
(GreT work): Vreat job,0
"(Great laptop for the price): We purchased this laptop for our 12 year old son, for his first ""gaming"" laptop.He loves it. The red lights make the laptop super ""cool"".I find that it has enough memory for what he needs it for. He has mentioned that certain games it ""lags"" a little. (his words not mine) but, nothing that he has really complained about. Overall I think this is a great starter laptop. If you are a huge gamer, it probably doesn't have all the bells and whistles that you are looking for. But for the price you can't go wrong. (Also, getting the matching mouse and headset is pretty awesome)",0
"(Love, Love, Love?!): Love, love, love! I'm not using it for gaming. Just wanted something with more power. It's so quiet, you don't know it's running! Its so fast, I couldn't believe it. Love the light up keyboard and everyone about this laptop. Couldn't be happier!",0
(reliable): easy to use,0
(Frustration for talks its not even a graphics/speed problem.): I dont think ill buy one of these chrome books ever again .I'm used to being able to do things on a regular windows PC easily .Unless you're doing something VERY BASIC with this computer I'd steer clear for something better. Even a standard cheap laptop.If you need to do things for work or tasks such as uploading/ opening/finding files etc. (Which I considered basic in itself) expect to find frustration from the awkward unfamiliar keyboard placement to just trying to enter information online and it refreshing and not being able to register that the information was imputed correctly.I'd honestly get rid of this if this wasn't my sole computer right now and not having funds for a new one .,0
(Just as good as new): I love it .. like new! Use it for work.,0
(Good): Great laptop for work and gaming fans are loud though and I average around 80-90 FPS in warzone,0
(Don't do it!): I had it for three months and had to ship it back to the manufacturer. Don't waste your time!,0
(Fast delivery great product value): Fast delivery great product value,0
"(Excellent Product): The product has not disappointed us - it has been fast and reliable and the shipping was quick. Setting the laptop up, downloading all of the updates, and learning all the new features takes time and patience. The laptop is fast and has not disappointed. It's just what was wanted.",0
(Slow to start): It is nice laptop but it takes a lot longer to turn on then my 7 years old HP laptop. I am returning this one.,0
"(Excelente pedido): Hasta ahora muy buen producto, llegó bien empaquetado y antes de lo previsto",0
"(Buen precio por lo que ofrese): Buen procesador, la memoria es poca pero es SSD, por lo que brinda rapidez, por la relación calidad precio es muy buena opción.",0
(Wowwww): Good one I like it,0
(This is pretty but is very light weight and cheaply made compared ...): This is pretty but is very light weight and cheaply made compared to others I have used. As it does not have a delete key on the keyboard is a must and helpful . It is not at all computer friendly.,0
(Loving it): Have been wanting one for a while great purchase and the m1 chip is well worth it,0
(BIG TIME - Buyer's Remorse/Purchase Regret): ...wrong adapter prongs (intended for international use); replacement adapter dead; original battery dead,0
"(No Quality Control, So far one the worst laptops I ever got): all the reviews here are talking about the good part which is gaming and performance, but I will be focusing on the missing part . the build quality and the issues.I will start with the worst part. this laptop screen will die eventually no matter what . the design causes a terrible friction between the hinges and internal display cables . this is inevitable so if you didn't suffered of it it this doesn't mean your unit is safe . this makes the screen disconnects and showing scrambled colors every time you close it I move it to the level I became terrified of closing the lid on all my devicesalso I have never seen a touchpad that pad in any laptop I used over the last 10 years ( and I have used a lot) not because the touchpad before 10 years were worse . it's just because I can't remember how it felt . first of all you can't gain advantage of its size because of the numpad button integrated into it have only 2 modes , either enable or dead area . mean either you will keep pressing it by mistake or you will end have an unused part of your touchpad , it is too soft to be used unless you have sweaty hands. I had to add a screen protector to it to make it usablenot to mention that the software is quirky specially if you installed a fresh windows on it, and you are bound to the buggy windows 11 because of the 12th gen intel processors having an issue of windows 10 not being able to differentiate between performance and efficient coreAlso I don't recall using a laptop without function lock button. seriously in 2022 no function lock ?and lights . lights makes you feel like a football player being bothered by lasers from the other team crowds . even with lid closed if it is not totally turned of it will shoot lights from top into your eyes . makes it impossible to sleep with it in the same room or having to shutdown every time , and when you turn of the bottom light strip ( u know in a meeting if you use it for work too ) it looks like and ugly white stripe affecting the laptop lookthunderbolt 4 port can't charge, so if you are connecting this to an eGPU (yes I know for now you shouldn't need a eGPU with such powerful RTX 3070TI but future proofing you know) which means you will need to attach either power cable or another charger even though you could depend on the power from the eGPU , also on type C power there is no real way to limit the consumption so the battery doesn't go down while using itthe lid scratches sooo easily , I got few scratches already even though I am taking a good care of it . but the black color is just a thin layerno finger print or any other biometric login , but instead they added a useless keystone .the body of the laptop is creaking a lot, a part of it because of the swappable plate in the backI 110% regretting buying an ASUS laptop , they used to be good I didn't know about their quality reductionNote : I had it shipped to me out of US that's why it is not easy this to put it back under RMA or somethingthe Good and okay parts :> Keyboard : if you are using it for writing you will differently like it . for gaming ? not the best .> Batter Life : for a *Gaming* *Intel* laptop it is okay (about 4 hours of normal use) , but if you want a full day battery then stay away of this laptop> Expansion : can be increase to 2 PCIe GEN 4 SSDs and 64 GB of ram . costly but worthy> Performance : I use it to write code may be more than I do to game , and I would say it serves this purpose in a better way . it is very fast for development work> above average display : it get bright enough for indoor without bright lights , good colorsin summary , this could be a good laptop . I could let all of its disadvantages pass . if it didn't have a quality control issue that will render it dead soon and the touch pad",0
"(2.5 years strong): I'm not sure why the reviews are so low. I've had mine for 2.5yrs - still works great. Had a small piece of plastic break off in transit from class one day, gets lugged everyday (I was a student when bought, now a teacher). I use the touchscreen daily in tablet mode with the Scrbble app for a notepad. Bought the pens that go with it still gets 5+ hrs of battery life even when watching videos. I love this computer and am surprised at how many have had issues!",0
"(Great gaming laptop for great price): Got this for my family to use; the kids for gaming and for video editing. It is amazing! It is fast at everything and runs every game and flies threw heavy editing. It's bulky and the battery life is just okay, but I wanted performance, not sleekness. It's actually really cool looking and both the keyboard and touchpad are great. Would definitely recommend.",0
"(A great, small computer for the money): I bought this at Costco, got rid of S mode and this is one fine small laptop. The display is stunning. Battery life is good. I might try to upgrade the SSD at sometime, but. I really love this machine.",0
(Works well with Oculus Quest 2): Easy to set up. Works great with Oculus Quest 2.,0
"(What a laptop, killer performance with beautiful display): I initially planned on purchasing the Alienware m15 as I have bought gaming computers from Alienware for the last 15 years. However, after dealing with the worse customer service I ever experianced I decided to spend my money with another company and said goodbye to Dell.I ended up between the Razor Blade 15 and the MSI GS 65. One of the things that stood out to me was that even though many of the professional reviews ranked the Razor Blade as the better laptop many of them mentioned the GS 65 as a viable lower cost option with the same performance. A review of Amazon, Best Buy and other sellers revealed that the MSI 65 was higher ranked then the Razor Blade by people who purchased the laptops with the GS 65 having 4.5 stars and the Blade 3.5.The one point that people made against the GS 65 was that it was not constructed as well as the Blade. I agree with this, holding them side by side was almost enough to go with the Blade. However the heating issue with th Blade and the fact that I would be paying hundreds of dollars more for the same performance but a better case made me go with the GS 65.The GS 65 runs like a dream with a beautiful display. I have not experianced it getting too hot and it has run everything I have thrown at it on ultra settings. The one thing I did not like is that MSI partioned the 512 SSD hardrive. Plan on undoing this next week and adding a second SSD hardrive for extra storage.As far a the GS 65’s construction, after using the laptop I do not find it to be flimsy. It is lightweight and the material used for the case plays a large part in keeping the weight down. As long as you are not banging on the keyboard should not be an issue.",0
"(small, portable, and light): it seems slow in the beginning, but all you need to do is change the settings and make it work faster. needs a lot of updates so be sure to do all of them. comes with windows 10 s, which is kinda bad because you can’t really download anything, especially chrome. change it to windows 10 and your all set.",0
"(Not worth the money and frustration): Even for the little amount, it is not worth the money. It has a limited Windows to start with. This makes it impossible to do anything. Once you get around that, it is incredibly slow and crashes constantly. The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. But it is lightweight, so I guess that’s what they got going for them. Honestly, not worth the money.",0
it seems as a very nice well constructed unit.,0
"(Great laptop, more than I had anticipated.): Fast and easy setup. Very user friendly. Would recommend this computer to anyone.",0
"(Good power, Excellent Materias, Loud fans): This is most likely your best choice for mid range laptop gaming and here is why:- The build quality is outstanding. The chassis is sturdy, the screen, ports, and keyboard/Touchpad are well attached and not flimsy. The fans are not cheap parts, they are loud but they are well manufactured and perform well.- The price to part ratio is amazing. To get a 2070RTX in this range elsewhere, you would lose on quality of parts elsewhere. With this one you get a nice GPU and the rest of the laptop matches its quality.- The Mobility is perfect. Some (like my last) were too heavy, got too hot, or the ports are in weird locations. This laptop places the ports perfectly, and they are built in well, no loose connections. The weight is a relief for the power this has. And heat displacement is probably one of the best in the industry. This unit will simply not die to heat if you treat it right.- The keyboard quality is amazing as well, the keys feel solid not flimsy, and it is spaced perfectly for me with big hands. Numberpad is a plus, the FN key when pressed lights up all the FN keys so you know what your enabling, very innovating and amazing job by engineering.Overall I would say this laptop is like the AK47 of gaming laptops. Solidly built and even after taking a beating it looks like it will still go forward. It performs well, stays cool, and feels great when using carrying.4.9 out of 5!",0
"(Just what I needed and quick too!): I like HP products and this computer is not an exception. My earlier, older, slower, and heavier laptop died between Zoom meetings. So it was research time and get an order placed, was I ever surprised when two days later I had a new laptop and was set up and handling everything like before. Working great with Chrome where many of my files were stored.",0
This laptop is great for school and work.,0
(Very cool): Nice for the price,0
The customization and colors of the keyboard are a wonderful bonus.,0
(Junk!!!!): Junk! Bought for Christmas of 2018 and dead by August of 2019. No product support.,0
"(Great Value): Fans are not as quiet as I thought, but overall a great laptop.",0
"I found the build quality great, and the keyboard is super nice to type.",0
"(Amazing): This thing runs games perfectly for hours. I did not expect the screen to work as well as it does. The color is amazing, the pixel refresh rate works great for Skyrim. I am beyond happy with my purchase, it's been over 6 months.",0
(Good student computer): Got this for my son for school and he loves it. Nice large screen and the battery lasts a long time. Good price.,0
(Great laptop): I’ve had a 2012 MacBook Pro and it’s still running good just a lil slow. Now to upgrade to this MacBook Air not a big difference but runs way smoother,0
(Very low battery backup): Pretty solid laptopsall the specs are good but battery backup is very low. On a full charge it can only runs for like an hour.,0
"(Good simple computer, good value for the $$$): Some reviews compared to a Macbook, which is unfair. This computer costs 1/3 price and you should expect some trade offs for saving that $1000. I am using it only for internet access and simple word processing, spreadsheet tasks. Does those jobs admirably. It is a bit slow to start up and needs a nudge to connect ""automatically"" to my trusted wifi networks. But nothing a couple of seconds patience won't overcome.",0
"(Horrible screen): The laptop worked fine but the screen was horrible. It was like going back in time 15yrs. Grainy, only looked decent from one very tight angle. I was disappointed enough to return it. And yes, I did have the setting as best as they would go.",0
(Great Purchase): This computer does everything my son wanted. He mainly wanted it for VR gaming and it seems to work great. It did take some adjusting of the settings to get it to work but we were able to figure it out finally.,0
"(Unusable after 4 hours): I recieved it today, and the screen stopped working after 4 hours, did not drop it or anything. Contacted asus, after giving them the serial number they said the model is from Asia, and the warranty won't cover shipping to Asus to be repaired which would take 7-10 days anyway. Decided to return it, sincerely hope anyone reading this review reconsider your options. Maybe non-defective machine is quite powerful like described, but I didn't even get to test it or even use it properly.",0
(Good overall!): Good!,0
(Crap): Not touch screen,0
(Budget Unit): product as good as competition.,0
(Features): Packed with lots of features.,0
"(It is the perfect price-quality laptop. I love it.): The backlit keyboard could be brighter. Other than that, it fulfilled my expectations.",0
"(Great Laptop until..): So I usually wait a good while before I write reviews since I want to get a good feel of the product. That being said, I bought this laptop in May 2021 and so far this laptop is a powerhouse- strong, reliable and fast. Can run multiple programs at the same time without overheating and runs games smoothly. Within the past month however, (April-May 2022) the screen has been experiencing screen tears, ghosting when scrolling or playing videos, flickering at the top edge of the screen and pixeling. And all of this has been happening with no prior damages happening to the laptop. Super unfortunate especially because of the price of the computer and now having to pay extra for a separate monitor to replace this one. I want to recommend it but I'd be super wary and prepare for this possibly happening to you.",0
"(poorly made, unreliable): This Chromebook is barely functional. Purchased it in August for my second grader to do virtual schooling. The camera and microphone frequently cut out and/or stop working. Shoddy construction and design. Disappointed that Samsung would put out such a substandard product.",0
(Working good so far!): Good little laptop for the money. Screen is clear and bright. The brushed chrome is a little rough. Wish the battery life was longer. Good buy.,0
(Slow loading): Nice size & price. But slow,0
"(Light & powerful): This is an outstanding laptop. It is light & compact, and really powerful. I mostly use it for work/office stuff, stream a lot of videos and it does that great, and I game a little and it's more than capable for all aspects. HDMI out, plenty of USB plugs. Gets a little hot on the bottom so be wary of putting onto cloth surfaces without ventilation, but man does it run fast. Touchscreen is nice but I use it sparingly, thumbprint option is cool, and the graphics and sound are both very good.",0
"(If you’re a weak bastard like myself, I wouldn’t recommend it, but it runs just about everything): Pretty good laptop, my only criticism against it is just a bit bulky and heavy and the fans get pretty loud. But other than that it runs games very well.",0
"(Low volume issues): Even at high volume, I can still barely hear media playing. It’s not my settings, and it’s not my ears lol, just can’t hear a thing. I have to turn my subtitles on.",0
(Disgustin'): Crap,0
(This is a great laptop.): Great performance and not noisy when in quiet mode. It is possible to upgrade RAM and storage (the two important things at least for me),0
"(It is ok.....): I do not regret buying it but to me having had it now for maybe 2 months and the white letters on the keyboard are beginning to already seem to fade away is not a good thing. I predict in another 6 months I would have to then add an external keyboard to this so I can use it and see the keys. HP you can do better than this, I expect this from an Acer not an HP.",0
the graphics card decided to disconnect itself from the computer.,0
"(sucksss): This thing straight up sucks. It's slap full of bloatware and you can't uninstall half of it. It doesn't have the power to run any kind of browser other than Microsoft Edge, and that browser isn't exactly uhhhh useful. It legit can't handle more than one tab at a time, and even then it takes forever. It is 100% not my internet, either. Even tried a wired connection and still got the same. It's just a crappy piece of hardware, so I guess it is true that you get what you pay for.At least it's lightweight and basically never dies.",0
"(advertised as 1920x1080, received 1366x768 screen): Requested replacement, received 1366x768 screen again. I guess I should take the hint",0
"(Five Stars): Great laptop, light and easy to use. Still compatible with all the software I used for Window 7.",0
(Excelente): Excelente,0
(Only lasted 2 years): This laptop was fantastic except it’s GPU died after only 2 years of use. Pathetic quality.,0
"(Absolutely amazing): Needed a gaming laptop, I previously had a Acer Predator which was only 15.6"". I wanted a 17 because I game a lot but I also travel a lot so I don't always have access to an external monitor.There's nothing I've thrown at it that it doesn't run smoothly at max or almost max settings. I also appreciate the minimalist design. It doesn't have 5 million stickers on it. One wouldn't be able to tell its for gaming at allAs expected from gaming laptops the battery life is quite bad.I also purchased an additional SSD for extra storage and found the installation simple.It does get quite loud though but that's also to be expected, but I game with a headset so it doesn't bother me",0
"(Junk): from day one, will not browse in internet even though its connected, and all other devices on the network work perfectly, contacted support and after transferring from rep to rep, they became rude and refused to solve the problem.",0
(Five Stars): It was just what I needed,0
"(Mine was defective...not confident enough to try another...): Almost every time I move the screen half with relation to the keyboard half, the Chromebook screen flickers and then it shuts down. Had to send it back for a refund. Otherwise, unit seemed pretty nice except for horrible owner's manual. Don't really know about battery life since I couldn't run it for long.",0
(Good quality): It works well as described.,0
(Slow): Computer is slower than I spected,0
(just don’t buy it): So my first one broke. HP replaced it. Second one broke. My insurance replaced it. Third one is now broken. Do not buy this laptop. Same problem every time. The touch screen and volume stop working then the screen just goes black. THREE TIMES IN A ROW!!,0
(He has thoroughly enjoyed it): Bought this for my 86yoa dad. Simple and nothing complicated about it. He has thoroughly enjoyed it,0
The box this one comes in makes it look like a present.,0
(Just what I needed): For the price...terrific deal.,0
"(the worst): continually Drops off the network, has to be continually restarted. The worst LT I HAVE EVER OWNED. It's going in the trash",0
"(Its easy to use): I use it for online schooling andit's perfect. I dont usually care for laptops, but this one is easy to use and on the smaller side so easier to use.",0
(Good i like it): Looking at lapyops finding a nicr one and thinking i can get that,0

"(Very Poor Battery life of SAMSUNG 15.6” Galaxy Book2 Pro Laptop , i7 / 16GB / 512GB, 12th Gen Intel): I bought SAMSUNG 15.6” Galaxy Book2 Pro Laptop Computer, i7 / 16GB / 512GB, 12th Gen Intel Core Processor, Evo Certified, Lightweight, 2022 Model, Graphite. While the model is light and is fairly comfortable to work with, the biggest attraction for this model was the promised battery life. I am quite disappointed with the very poor battery life of fewer than 5 hours. This is less than a third or fourth of what I was expecting. I am currently based in the Philippines and would like Samsung to pay attention to this problem. Not sure if the issue is with my unit or it is applicable to all the units. This is one of the costlier units and Samsung may want to guard its reputation for its premium product.",0
"(Okay laptop - HORRIFIC RETURN EXPERIENCE): The laptop is a good laptop for the price and specs. I returned it because 1. Speakers sounded blown out 2. My hdmi port was loose and it would cause my monitors to flicker or lose connection. I don’t like gaming on such a small monitor so I use my larger ASUSMy real issue is the return experience. Oh my god has it been horrible… Returned it 06/16/2022 have the tracking # and physical receipt for shipping. After 10 days the refund is pending at “print a label and ship it” I’ve reached out 4 times and was corporately told to screw off each time. They have my receipts, tracking information everything I could give them and they still refuse to issue my refund. I’ve had to dispute this transaction with my bank in hopes of ever seeing my money again. These customer service people are the worse, they don’t keep logs of prior conversations but luckily I kept record of them all. I’m so infuriated and disappointed at this point. GO TO NEWEGG and try your luck there or anywhere for gods sake just don’t buy here. I managed to buy a new PC, have it processed, shipped and have played it for 3 days now and these guys haven’t made it past the first step of the return. I’ll never make any large $ amount purchase on this trash site again.",0
"(A beast!): I was looking for a laptop with at least nVidia 3060 for a long time. Most of those I found were with a GPU that had reduced power. Well, not this baby! It is a venerable BEAST!

"(BUY THIS THING YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT): I’ve had this for 4 months now and it’s absolutely incredible. I can’t say enough about this computer. I can run GTA5 at 1080p with no lag and it’s crystal clear. It does get a little warm but I’ve never hit thermal throttling. It’s not really an issue.This thing is so light and compact and easy to carry in a backpack. Build quality is excellent. I literally do not have a single complaint. I’m a mechanical engineering student and am constantly running autocad, inventor, ansys... all of the above and it puts everybody else’s machines to shame. I love it.",0

(Works fine.): Dells are always decent.,0
(cumple con todas las expectativas y mas): cumple con todas las expectativas y mas,0
"(Coil whine noise): In my personal opinion, this computer makes a lot of noise which I found very noticeable in quiet rooms. It has a very noticeable coil whine and a very noticeable noise of the fans as they are active all the time with regular daily usage. The design looks elegant, but you can see the fingerprints all over after first use. A little overpriced for what Asus is offering.If this computer didn't have a coil whine noise and was built with a material that didn't leave smudges, I would have totally loved it.",0

"(Satisfactory purchase): Bought it for my daughter and so far she enjoys it a lot, nothing to complain.",0
"(Better than expected): I've only used weak laptops until I got this. For its price, it's giving you more than you could ask for. The battery life is like any other 1k dollar laptop, but the performance is great. No lag, overheating, or and sort of intense fan after using for hours and it's easy to get used to and light. Only complaint is the arrow keys aren't lined up with the rest of the keyboard which restricts its capability to game using them with nearby keys so I'd have to reach for them.",0

"(Don't Buy Lenovo): From the very first month this laptop started to malfunction. There were constant issues with the screen going grey or white and freezing as well as operating so slowly that I couldn't stream netflix or Amazon video on it, not that you can watch anything on this mirror like screen. To view any image on the screen the room has to be completely dark or you had to sit 12"" away from the screen in a mostly dark room.I had this laptop sent back so many times (and lenovo repeatedly refused to fix it right away because a 30 day old computer that freezes and goes dark at random is an ""intermittent"" problem that they were not responsible for) they replaced it with a ""new"" one, but that one won't turn on unless plugged into the wall, even with a full battery right out of the box.The Flex has given me so much trouble I use a 6 year old toshiba laptop that is literally held together by glue and screws because even with it's keyboard popping off and the hinges for the screen broken, it gives me less trouble than the Lenovo Flex.Don't buy from lenovo! Save yourself some agony.",0
"(Great for the price fast speeds on both graphics and wifi): I really liked this LaptopIf there was one think i would change is just add more drive space, 250gb isn't enough these days for games, so be wary you may want to buy a second drive, luckily this comes with an additional connector",0
"(Not working..): So I received this laptop today, I set up email and Download one of my programs. Then shut it down, went to turn it back on 3 hours later and would not turn back on. Support say it needs repair, on a 3 hour old laptop... beware.",0
"(So far so good!): So I purchased this laptop from Razer.com because it's the only way to get RazerCare. Which I hope I will never need, but based on the reviews of previous Blade generations and this one, it seemed like a necessity. Especially when spending $3,000 on a laptop (I bought the 4K model).So far though about a week of owning it, absolutely zero problems. This laptop was out of stock the night before I wanted it and was in stock the next morning, so it must be a fresh off the assembly line machine. Which hopefully means any of the problems you see from reviews in the summer are less relevant (hopefully). That or I just got a great machine (so far). I can't find any flaws though and I absolutely love using the thing. Coming from a Macbook Pro that I was running in boot camp 90% of the time because I'm an architect and I live in a Windows world, I am satisfied with a beautiful device that is well designed and has a keyboard that, while it has taken some adjustment, I really love the feel of it. I'm not perfect with it yet by any means. Mainly because the keys are small and the space between them is larger than my Surface Book (my other work machine) and my Macbook.This thing is a beast. I play Destiny 2 a lot and it devours it. Awesome. I have peace of mind because I own several computers, but this one has the potential to be my favorite, easily. I don't fully trust Razer yet, but having the RazerCare makes me feel good. Amazon offers their own warranty's through third parties and I considered them for sure, but ultimately was scared of that too.For what it's worth, I think it's asking a lot for a machine with zero problems at all. My Surface Book does weird stuff and my Macbook has suffer a faulty logic board. So nothing is perfect. And the Razer may fail. It does get hot and loud. But out of the box, it's everything I could have asked and hoped for.I will update this if anything bad happens. If I never update, you can assume I'm still smiling at the gorgeous 4K screen.",0
"(Great specs, but does not support G-Sync): When I bought this, I expect GSync would be supported, but it's not. This is a stunning omission for a laptop that has a 240 Hz screen and a 3070. I don't get it. Why leave out a very important gaming feature?Laptop has been returned. No G-Sync is a deal breaker for me.",0
"(Decent but the battery life is a joke. Returning): All and all, it's a decent lap top, but I don't like being deceived (lied to). The 85w max on the gpu which is listed at 130w is a pretty big lie and makes the 3070 a 3060 more or less. I'm returning. Get accurate descriptions!",0
The laptop display is pretty nice and per key RGB is also a huge visual plus point.,0
"(Does not come with fingerprint as description): It's very light and fast, operate smoothly till now but I expect the fingerprint reader as in the description, this version does not come with that",0
"It is light weight, has a touch screen, pencil and everything you could possibly want.",0
(Five Stars): Arrived on time and my daughter LOVES IT❤,0
"(Love this laptop): I'm a fortysomething female who is sick of lugging heavy things around, including laptops. I did a lot of research before purchasing this machine. It came down to this one versus the HP Spectre 360. I ended up going with this one because it was slightly less expensive. I've owned it nearly a year now and I have no regrets. It powers up incredibly quickly, the battery lasts a good long while - I'd say 6 to 8 hours online or doing power point. It's extremely lightweight, which I love. I bought a minimalist case for it and when I wear it across my body, I sometimes forget I'm wearing it. I haven't had any problems with the machine overheating or the fan being loud. The only design issue I'd flag is that the screen doesn't bend as far back as I'd like it to. More noticeable if I'm using my machine on the subway and need a bit more distance between me and the screen. Otherwise, no complaints.",0
Everything runs so well and the design is so sleek,0
you have to use the USB connector to open the port slightly so that you can insert it,0
(Overall good): Good stuff. The charger can be an issue.,0
(Great for college): For this price this laptop is amazing. I use this for gaming and college and it runs great. Very durable and can run bigger games like sims and castlevania.,0
"(Really Disappointing Performance): Have had this laptop for a few weeks and am disappointing in its shortcomings.1) it's just not that fast. For all the fancy specs, I'm not noticing much better performance than the 5 year old MacBook air I was replacing. This is brand new, out of the box, the bloatware deleted and a very light antivirus.2) internet runs unbelievably slowly. All my other devices work great on my Wifi, but this thing clocks glacial speeds (slower than my phone on or off Wifi). Updated all the drivers, fiddled with network settings. All to no avail. This is the deal breaker for me.3) speakers. are. trash. So quiet I can't even hear dialogue in shows. When I ""boost"" with an extension to my browser, music and speech are garbled (like the speakers are blown out). You'd think the advertised Harman / Kardon hardware it would be better4) webcam looks like you're filming on a 10 year old flip phone.The battery life is pretty nice, the thing runs quiet (never notice the fan) and it's light and portable. But it really just doesn't do the job. I wanted to get past the budget-brand Asus nameplate and believe in the power advertised ""under the hood"" but unfortunately I'm going to have to get something ""fancier"" and less spec-ed out, probably back to a Mac.",0
(Works as expected.): Easy to start up .,0
"Setup was incredibly fast and easy, with Cortana guiding the way",0
"(Totally ridiculous computer): This was a purchase I looked forward to arriving at my door. Unfortunately this is the worst computer acquisition I have made during 30 years of owning computers and close to 25 years of owning laptops. The keyboard is a very large disappointment in that it is needlessly small keyboard with considerably more potential real estate for keys on the existing board and the keystroke is far too shallow, feeling like you are typing on a cheap game controller. I kept the computer for a week trying to become accustomed to it but can't stand it. It is the first computer I have and am considering returning. Don't waste your time and money without finding one of these in a store and checking it out. TERRIBLE keyboard. I am a developer and would be spending quite a bit of time on this kid keyboard. Can't even consider it.",0
(Stay Away - 1 Year Old Hard Drive Failure): Stay away from this model. The hard drive failed after a year of use and was out of warranty. Asus wants $400 to fix it.,0
(Great laptop!): Works great. No problems.,0
(Excellent computer): Very fast!,0
(Five Stars): My son started college. He says it really works for him.,0
(Great laptop-bad battery life): Great gaming laptop4 stars cut the battery dies in 1 hour while gaming,0
It has adequate brightness to use in daylight,0
"(It’s a decent laptop): Love the size of the laptop. It’s not touchscreen and there’s no “cap” key, so it takes a while to get used to using this keyboard. All in all it gets the job done.",0
"(So far so VERY good!): I bought this laptop just to have something ""mobile"" when I want to get online or do some ""light work"" out of the house (I normally use my desktop computer which is a BEAST!)I will be using this to watch movies/videos, surf the net, check emails, go on social media and a couple other programs such a OBDII reader that I will use with my OBDII device via wifi or usb to work on my cars.4GB of ram is good enough for what I will be doing. If I ever feel that it needs a little more power/speed I will add another 4 or 8 but so far it is perfect.The 128GB SSD is more than enough for what I need and this was one of the key factors that made me buy this computer. Cheaper ones come with eMMC storage which is slower and normally only 32GB or 64GBIt does not have backlit keyboard, I wish it did but it is not a deal breaker and I already knew it didn't have it before placing my order.It takes about 45 seconds to boot (a little bit on the slow side) but once its loaded it runs pretty smoothlyIt came with Windows 11 S More which won't allow you to install anything except from the Microsoft store (I think that's what's called), but getting out of S mode is SUPER EASY, takes less than 1 minute. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern). I also like the fact that is a name brand and is not a chrome book!I don't give it 5 stars because it would've been nice to get it with 8GB and a backlit keyboard. Other than that is perfect for what I need!",0
"(Seriously the best gaming laptop you could ask for this price.): Just to be certain, this is the Ryzen 7 4800H processor 16GB ram ddr4 and 512 SSD - I put a 1TB ssd in it m.2 - the 144fps IPS screen is soo nice! 1660 TI handles anything ive thrown at it!! its beautiful!! buy it",0
(Google based. Don’t like android technology.): I don’t like android based technology. It is t comparable with Microsoft.,0
(Five Stars): No issue at all.,0
"(No regrets, hands down, favorite laptop for its price.): Great price for an amazing laptop. RAM and SSD would be the only thing to upgrade and get the top notch gaming experience. This thing runs at 100 fps on high settings and 150 with normal settings. Fans are a bit loud and pretty recognizable but it doesnt name me feel like I regret purchasing this. I fell in love with this laptop and is definitely worth it",0
(Very very slow): Crap don’t buy it,0
boot time is short and everything runs incredibly fast even with the highest game settings,0
"(I bought this in July. Now, in October ...): I bought this in July. Now, in October, it has just frozen. I can't turn it off and the mouse does nothing...very frustrating and disappointing. I only use it for email, shopping and FB, but now I can't use it all.",0
"(THERE IS NO DVD PLAYER): We bought this and everything works fine, but there is NO DVD player as described and pictured, which is why we picked this specific laptop.",0
The battery life for this is around 7 hours which is very far above average for gaming laptops,0
"(Arrived damaged.): I didn't get to use it. I received it damaged. What ever it hit went through 2 boxes and an air gap of about an inch. Still put a dent in the bottom of the computer 1/8"" deep. Not happy about that. Plus nothing was done for me but putting the amount on a gift card. Because they were out of the computer I ordered. Locking me into buying from Amazon. Even though I needed the computer asap. Not to happy about the whole ordeal.",0
(Charger not working but everything else are working good):,0
(Worst experience): The screen is so bad. It is not colorful nor clear. The worst thing is that I cannot charge it. (Plugged but not charging).,0
The touchscreen every so often wouldn’t respond.,0
(Terrible laptop. Locks up all the time when I ...): Terrible laptop. Locks up all the time when I am using WORD. I will never purchase another ASUS. I will stick to Dell.,0
"(Horrible Noise issue): After a couple of months of usage, I noticed some noise issue with the fan. Now it's been 2 years the fan is crackling like there is no tomorrow, this product is officially worthless as I can use it in a productive environment. I don't mind the expense as it's only $700, but good lord focus on quality.",0
it gets wicked hot at high settings,0
"(Perfect Basic laptop. Quick easy setup): I like how easy it was to setup. The functionality of it is very user friendly. I just needed a computer for internet/email/documents. This is a basic and perfect laptop for what I needed. It has met my needs. My only complaint is the screen can be kind of hard to see at certain angles. But definitely not enough to be a deal breaker for me and I'm finicky. Also, I wish the keyboard was back-lit. But also, not a deal breaker for the price.I couldn't see using this for gaming. But I'm not a gamer.",0
(Compact size and versatility): The accessory plug ins are really nice on this model with a substantial memory.,0
(Nice laptop): Nice laptop,0
"(Great product): Product was as advertised, very pleased!",0

"(Works well.): Good laptop, for a good price.",0
I get a device that doesn’t allow me to use G-sync I did all kind of updates and factory reset but this is how I got the device.,0
"(Better than Windows for internet access and simple and daily things): I love it so much. I have an Acer Aspire E5-771G with Windows 10 Pro, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 1TB HDD and a gforce 940 and 17.3 inches screen, but is so heavy and big, I used just for office or DJing, but when I wanna be at bed or at street, or just for work like a teacher, is so perfect, don't confuse for the price and specifications, is a great productive tool, I use all at cloud, after upgrade to last version It can runs Android apps like Word and Excel and others more. Is small, thin, confortable and very fast and reliable, really, is a great productive laptop, if you will open chrome and use all at cloud, then this is the perfect computer for you.",0
"(Muy buena opción si buscas algo para tareas diarias): Es una laptop muuy buena, tiene teclado retroiluminado (no RGB), buenos componentes, el mouse pad tiene un lector de huellas que funciona muy bien y me gusta mucho, la cámara es de buena calidad, y el micrófono no me gusta tanto, pero sirve muy bien.Lo único que no me gusto, es la pantalla, la batería dura poco y que el teclado no esta en español.En general, muy buena laptop, me sirvió mucho para mis clases online, jugar minecraft y algunos otros juegos, ver netflix y usar chrome, me gusto mucho y es buena opción si buscas algo de calidad a un buen precio",0
(Five Stars): It' a really nice laptop,0
"(Good laptop): I bought this for one of my younger sisters a few months ago and she's loved it so far. It runs the games she wants and she can use it for coding, for her schoolwork, and other general usage too. We've placed games against each other online and this is definitely quieter than my Alienware (Alien v. Predator--I couldn't help myself when looking for a laptop for her and saw that this one was good). That said, my alien has two power intakes for more intense gaming and it's noticeable if I'm doing a lot, so it has the advantage there.This Predator Helios is a great beginner gaming laptop for anyone too lazy (like me and my sister) to build their own. I'm sure she'll want something better latter on, but its great for her teenage self.",0
"(Laptop Asus muy buena en rendimiento y calidad): Excelente producto y muy bonito color me gustó mucho en especial el teclado Retroiluminado, el portátil rinde perfectamente por los 8Gb de ram y su SSD M.2 recomendado",0
"(let me be honest): Ok so i think this laptop is really good,excellent picture,great design,very lightweight,the light up keyboard is really nice(i just gotta learn if it can change colors or not though),it boots up really fast,the fingerprint scanner works like it's intended and it's a great addition,my only gripe with this laptop is the fact it comes with an annoying color that makes the screen a little yellow-ish due to some program,so while in a white screen like this one it's coloration makes it look beige-ish,which is annoying,i gotta learn on how to delete it so it can go back to actual white screen and not beige-ish,the volume on it though is lacking and it pretty much requires you to either get an external speaker or to download a volume booster app which sucks cause there's no free ones just 7 days trials one which sucks,,oh and also the small ssd hard drive which is 128gb is disappointing but i do have an external hard drive that this laptop supports just fine so it isn't too big a deal,idk i like it so far the packaging was very nice and it was delivered on time as expected,it's a really great laptop,now i haven't tested out every feature yet but i will soon,if there's any change in my opinion i'll redo this review,for now i think it's worth the price,i hope this review helps,peace!",0

(Chromebooks are quick boot ups and perfect for web surfing): The best way to surf the web. Quick and easy.,0
(Not happy): I bought this item in March of this year and it just stopped working won’t take a charge or anything will be looking to get it covered by amazon will see what happens results will be forthcoming,0
"(Fast delivery, awesome product, no lost data): The first Chromebook, about 18 months old, died. The college student loves the Chromebook. It works perfect for him. The great part was all of his work was in the cloud so he didn't loose anything.Amazon was able to deliver it in one day! He couldn't have bought one locally in that amount of time. Quick delivery was key!",0
"(Trash due to Powershell and S-mode): Microsoft gets worse every year. S-mode is a massive problem and is a virus. Why do I say it is a virus? Well, because it doesn't count as a verified Microsoft App! The stupid thing started to run itself on startup, triggering S-mode, and then freezing on the warning window pop-up...rendering the laptop entirely useless. People shouldn't have to deal with this sort of absurd incompatibility issues right out of the damn box.",0

"(NICE SIZE, WEIGHT, NO BACKLIT KEYS): HP Pavilion x360 Convertible 14-inch Laptop, 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor - seems to be a great little computer, nothing really exceptional, easy to set-up - NOTE: although someone responded in the ""questions/answers"" section that this had backlit keyboard, this is NOT TRUE, NO BACKLIT KEYBOARD. I purchased specially because I liked everything I read about this PC and when I saw that someone had indicated it did have backlit keys, I decided to go with it.......was so disappointed. So I am returning......It is a shame that so many feedback and question/answer results on this site aren't reliable. Sometimes you are not even sure the responses are even for the item you are wanting to buy. Makes buying decisions very difficult. I have learned from this to always try to look under manufacturer on-line if available before making an actual buy. In this case, I didn't and went by the information I found under the product here.",0

"(Fan Noise and Heat Problems): Admittedly the laptop is incredibly sleek. The display is phenomenal, the laptop is very lightweight, and the specs just speak for themselves.However, what is absolutely unacceptable about it is its fan noise. Most people have complained that the fan is really loud whenever the laptop is plugged into the charger, and while this is absolutely true, I've also noticed the fan runs really loudly even when the laptop is unplugged or sitting idle and it tends to get really hot. The obnoxious fan starts running even if all I'm doing is opening up a web browser and checking my email.For a brand new laptop of this price and technology, the fan noise and heating issues are unacceptable, especially considering how they're triggered at the most menial of computer tasks. My beat up 6 year old Lenovo laptop is significantly quieter and doesn't overheat. The only time it does is when I'm doing a substantial amount of work or gaming for too long with my computer which is how is completely understandable. The XPS 13 9370 has no such excuse.",0

"(Good Performance in a Small Package): This review is from: ASUS M580VD-EB76 15.6"" Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 16 GB DDR4 Memory 256 GB SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming LaptopPros: Background: I bought this to replace my aging 5 year old (Bulky/Heavy) MSI laptop with a 660M. Set up was relatively fast and I got most of my files and settings set up in around 2 hours on and off once Windows 10 was done downloading and installing updates. Onto the physical bits:-The computer is extremely thin and light like the product description suggests. Build quality is quite good and the plastic bottom could have fooled me for how solid it feels. I could go on for days how much nicer using this laptop is than my old MSI.-Speakers are a mixed bag in that at proper (i.e. lower) volumes they sound super clean and wonderfully full especially when voices and speech are concerned. I'd say they are better than they are worse so long as you adjust the volume to suit whatever you are listening to, as they tend to distort easily on higher settings. By far the best laptop speakers I've heard under the right conditions.-The specs for this computer looked good on paper and play good in practice (so far). Boot up from fully shut down takes around 5-8 seconds to the login screen which is faster than my desktop. The 1050 inside is able to play last gen titles well like Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin and so on at full HD with no issues. I haven't tried pushing it with more demanding titles so that might be updated later on.-Wireless is extremely fast with no latency or issues.Cons: -Keyboard is kind of squishy if you ""really"" push down on the keys with a small amount of flex on the surrounding area being depressed but unless you like to smash the keys when you type it's perfectly serviceable with decent feedback.-Screen has sweet spots and the viewing angle can wash out colors quickly if you aren't looking at it dead on. Not a deal breaker but noticeable.-Fan noise is noticeable when running benchmarks, but I guess that was expected. Could be worse.-Battery life is not amazing but it charges quickly.-Stuck with the 1050 instead of a 1050 ti or 1060 variant, couldn't find a higher spec'd GPU on the Vivobook line, which is a shame as I'd have gladly paid a bit extra for some more power.-Some bloatware from ASUS but nothing that couldn't be removed with minimal effort.Other Thoughts: -I would recommend this model if you are looking for a very professional looking laptop for work with the ability to stretch its legs and do some decent gaming on the side. I primarily got this for travel and for its form factor/styling, as it doesn't scream ""WOW LOOK AT ME I AM A GAMER LOOK AT ME"" like most competing models seem to flaunt with horrible aesthetics. For $999 (at the time of this review) and the performance/form factor this laptop is in a very specific segment that I wasn't able to find anywhere else for the relative cost, especially with it having a 7700HQ and 256 SSD AND 16 Gigs of ram AND the 4 Gig 1050.-My only concern with this product was heat from the GPU and if the design could cope. Will update when I have more results. Dark Souls II didn't push the GPU too hard from what I could gather.-I would give this laptop more like a B+/A- if the scale permitted more nuance, particularly with the screen being so picky for viewing angles. ASUS has made a great product and I look forward to taking this with me around the world and where my job requires me to go.",0

(Happy with this acquisition.): Great option in the product.Completely satisfied.,0
"(Love it): Works great right out of the box. hooked my mouse to in via Bluetooth and away i went. windows home fully functional but only has trial antivirus. not a big deal for me since i already have service through norton. fires up fast due to the SSD and works quickly through my tasks. have loaded up online RPG rift and ran on max settings with no issues, even pretty good on heat. my only Alienware got so hot it would make my lap uncomfortable. so far i have ye to see this one get too hot to hold so to speak. Everything is smooth and works like it should. i have yet to run into any hardware issues or lagging but those things usually take time to show. at this time i am very happy with this laptop and would gladly buy again. considering it is a gaming laptop for under a grand i am very satisfied with the product for sure",0
"(So far, SO GOOD): I have had this computer for a few weeks now. I got it on Black Friday and was forced to buy it used since the Walmart Black Friday deal was awful.So far it is a really good buy! I’m familiar with chromebooks as I used them to teach kids computer science.I specifically got this chromebook for class. I’m going into my junior year of college and up until this moment I have gotten away with not needing a computer. It is very light and small enough to carry around with no issues. It is very simple, just as I needed! Seems to be working great and charging just fine.Will update if anything changes but for now I think this is awesome for students, kids, and adults who just need something simple and cheap.",0

ME A ENCANTADO la uso para jugar league of legends y corre a 220 fps a 240 fps, otros juegos actuales como its take two que pide autos requisitos, corre super fluido sin bajones de fps ni nada, pienso descargar elden ring. La bateria se descargar lentamente mientras juegas un juego que pide los maximos requisitos cuando jugaba its take two la lapto estaba toda cargador y se descargarba de forma pasivo, aunque eso no baja su rendimiento en el juego. Jugu como 6 horas y solo se descargar como un 20%. Algo que note es que una vez la use y estaba a 95% la bateria la conecte por que hiba a jugar lol para que no se descargara y no se cargaba se quedo en 95% note que la bateria solo se cargaba cuando estaba en 90 o menos nose a que se deba eso. En resumen es increíble super ligera, con mucha capacidad, solo que no tiene tanto espacio pero se arregla con una memoria usb, nunca se me a recalentado.Pd: para configurar la luz de la teclas o desactivarlas y ver otras configuraciones deben entrar en la aplicación Msi que viene por defecto en el menu de Windows",0
it is gorgeous and the all-aluminum body is outstanding!!!,0
"(screen and random restart problems ,dont buy this trash laptop): After 1 month i notice some dark vertical lines on screen.it very noticeable on green screen.its not software issue,i try many drivrs and options,even linux live usb.this lines visible on bios screen alsoi am outside of usa so lenovo costumer service and amazon support didnot help me.Also it randomly restart itself,without any action or triger,i try lots of things to fix this but nothing works,trust me i am working in IT and know how such things must fixed,but nothing works for this.I read that many users have same problems",0
"(Excellent Chromebook.): Everything about is great, and it meets all of my needs; it's lightweight, durable and so far I haven't used it enough at one siting to drain the battery. My only complaint would be the speakers, which are not quite as good as I hoped, but really, no reason why I wouldn't heartily recommend this to anyone.",0
(Perfect for my needs!): This is my favorite laptop ever. The battery life is excellent. I like the keyboard and despite seeing many reviews with complaints about the trackpad I have no such complaints. The ports available are great. The screen is not the brightest (bonus for battery life) but I like the panel. Great everday workhorse! I wouldn't recommend for mostly media consumption.,0
"(Five Stars): Good quality, reasonably priced laptop. Thank you.",0
(Solid): Fast computer for college. Clear screen. My Kindle books are crystal clear,0
"(They aren't kidding when they say it's slim and sleek!): They aren't kidding when they say this is thin and sleek. It has such a slim profile that it's sized like a small folder, so it's incredibly portable and easy to work on when traveling. The 13 inch screen in perfect when you need something bigger and easier to work/type on than a tablet, but don't want anything too big or bulky.Comparing this to my Acer Spin 5, the actual screen viewable area seems to be larger. The bezel frame around the Acer is wider, so the super slim frame around the Dell offers even more screen viewing real-estate.The touch screen is very responsive and I'm pleased they included a backlit keyboard. My Acer that's similar in style and design doesn't have a backlight, which has been an issue since the start. I never thought it would be a big deal, until I didn't have the backlight and I realized how difficult it can be to type in low light with black keys that have nothing to light them up.One thing that's very different between the systems is how few ports this computer has. This Dell has just a single type C port and an SD card slot. My Acer Spin 5 has two type C ports, an HDMI, two USB ports and an SD slot. However my Acer is a tiny bit thicker than this Dell. So you sacrifice additional ?ports for having an ultra slim design. Something to keep in mind when deciding on a computer, since what you connect to this Dell will be limited.The speakers sound quite good for such a small machine. The screen is bright and the colors are rich. The included graphics card has been able to run everything smoothly for me so far. While I don't game with this Dell, I do some video editing with it and the software has worked well without any lagging or crashing. About the only thing I could think of changing would be the inclusion of a single USB port, for use with some small wireless travel mice.",0
(works as intended!): works as intended!,0
The coolest thing is how lightweight it is,0
"(Good speed/less than stellar battery life): This Acer Aspire performs well for the most part. It responds quickly and runs smoothly. Basically, it does everything it claims without problems. It does run in Windows S mode, so if you're planning to use Google, this won't accommodate it. You can't download anything that isn't a Microsoft approved app. I primarily use it for word or excel and sometimes editing pictures, and it does great for that. The biggest problem for me is the battery life - or lack of battery life to be more accurate. Fully charged, I only get about 4 hrs before it needs to be plugged in. Even when it's not in use - in sleep mode or turned off - the battery depletes faster than any laptop I've owned. For example, the laptop was in sleep mode and in a day, the battery was dead. Turned completely off, it's drained in a couple of days. Other than that, it's not a bad machine for the money, but the battery life is a problem when I want to take it on the go and don't want to deal with recharging before I even get a chance to use it.",0
"(Great product but..): Great product. The battery could last a bit longer and it is not as light as computers made today BUT, this thing is really fast and is able to run many programs at once. If I could give it 10 stars for Value for Money I would",0
(Five Stars): Just love my new Chromebook.,0
(Great Laptop): I bought this used through Amazon. It came in like-new condition. My daughter uses it to play Minecraft and Star Stables. We've had it for a month or so and are very pleased with it. I highly recommend it and buy it again if I had the need.,0
"(Almost a fantastic laptop...): Despite being powerful, lightweight and crapware free, the chassis is not as strong as it appears to be. The durable aluminium body is held down onto fragile plastic plates that don't seem to be engineered to bear the stress of daily use.I noticed the backplate lifting in one corner a few days ago- I have owned this laptop since mid October. I've contacted customer support and hope to get a resolution to this, but honestly I'm pretty disappointed given the price point and the aluminium chassis being one of the more attractive selling points to me.If you are going to use this as a professional work horse keep this in mind.",0
"(NIce look.): Screen is bigger than I thought, like that. Other than that it's just like my old chromebook, LOVE it!",0
"(Great computer great price for Architecture School): I use this computer for Architecture school, and does everything i need, its fast and reliable.",0
"(Not a NEW laptop): This product was advertised as new. When I opened it, there were two user profiles already set up (see photo) and the language was set for a non-English language. When I called Amazon, they sent me to Dell. When I called Dell, they said the computer (which I purchased on 9/21/19) was originally purchased/set up in June.I am returning this. I bought it for my kid. Kids can be rough on equipment, so I want to give him the benefit of starting with new equipment. Also, who knows what the prior owner did with it.",0
"Even though the heat does not reach high temperatures, the noise is loud enough to cover even the highest volume coming from the game.",0
"(Avoid: Audio render problem means volume won't work on videos): I bought a Dell XPS 13 in Nov, 2018. (It is not touchscreen). I not not recommend this notebook if you ever listen to videos. For at least five months, I've had repeated instances (every day) of the volume not working, i.e. in YouTube videos, Spotify and video links on news websites such as CNN and NY Times. I get a message stating that there is an Audio Renderer Error and telling me to reboot. When I reboot, the problem is resolved. However, it recurs again and again, often within just 30 minutes. I have tried various solution. I checked all devices and connection, making sure I hadn’t muted the sound, etc. Then I update the driver, and I run the audio troubleshooter. I checked for updates. Of course, I have all updates downloaded after going through this process so many times. I have also uninstalled the audio driver and reinstalled it again. I am SO tired of rebooting my laptop just to listen to a video! I am aware, from the online community, that many others have this problem. How can Dell not resolve this problem? I really wish I had chosen another laptop and am surprised the Dell XPS gets such great reviews",0
The price is manageable and it packs a powerful potential within its tiny frame.,0
"(Compared to the 2016 models, I really didn't feel ...): Compared to the 2016 models, I really didn't feel this model was any faster. We have 6 HP touchscreen Chromebooks we use in our medical practice and the original one works just as fast.",0
(Fast and powerful): Love it. It's fast and the sound quality is crazy good.,0
"(My son loves it for his school, no issues!): My son uses it for school, he loves it, we love it. No issues so far.",0
"(Great laptop): Not a tech kinda person. I just wanted a laptop for uni that would be able to use word and PowerPoint and let me watch my lecture videos. Well, it’s fantastic. Nice and lightweight, thin, sleek and works really well. The best part is that the battery lasts for ages! I use my laptop every day for uni (~6 hours a day maybe more or less depending on the day) and I’ll charge it probably 4 times a week! Love this laptop, definitely recommend!",0
(There is nothing I don't like about this laptop): The Lenovo ideapad 330 is much faster than my 4 year old laptop. The display is very bright and crisp. I am not a gamer and use this computer primarily for web browsing and email and occasionally streaming video. So far I have not encountered anything that I don't like about this computer.,0
(Great for what I wanted): Over all great laptop for pricing. Does run slower than average but that should be expected for price and size.,0
"(Great Value performance Laptop): Getting this item on Black Friday sale really helped the Value proposition. Laptop performs as the spec sheet details, no compromises. 105TDP for the 3060 is a good average performer.The screen looks great, but is not the brightest, and has been reviewed to not having the complete color space - if you are looking for a graphics professional calibrated display, there are likely better options.Easy to update to maximize the usable lifespan of the laptop, 2 SODimm slots, 2 NVMe slots.Keyboard is good and tactile, I liked getting the 10key complete keyboard.Arrangements of the ports, all on the Left side is a little odd, but not a deal breaker when you get TB4.0, Full Size HDMI and Ethernet.Lastly, not much bloatware preinstalled and it wasn't terribly hard to remove...",0
(Maybe use a different seller): Stopped working with a month,0
"(Quick start): Great product, sharp images, very clear.",0
(Wouldn't have anything else): Lost for words it's that good,0
(Perfect): Perfect,0
(You get what you pay for): Yikes! I guess a plastic laptop with a poor screen is not for me. Save up for a nicer one if you can.,0
The light up keyboard has gotten dozens of compliments after only having the machine for about 2 weeks.,0
(Have to play plugged to the charger): Awesome laptop,0
"(False advertising. Screen is not 1080, but 768 resolution.): The screen is not 1920x1080 as advertised. It’s 1366x768 resolution.",0
"(Great Computer): I use this for work and it's great. As a graphic designer, it has more than enough room to hold all my files.",0
"(Great Value): Love this thing! I got it as a backup for streaming from my gaming system, and to play some older titles on-board. Some find the screen a little dim, I don't notice that. It's only got a GTX1650, so you're not looking at Anthem at Ultra settings with this, though it'll run everything out at the time of this writing. This is for casual gaming, after all. If your looking to squeeze out high FPS at 4k you're not going anywhere near this for sure. That isn't a knock--at this price point this laptop is a screaming deal.The i5 is great, and snappy in daily use. The placement of the various ports is a little goofy (hence deducting a star), but no tech is perfect. I run this with 16gb of RAM and I added a 1tb hard drive, which when added to the overall price still makes this a very good deal.And it isn't listed, but this does have Bluetooth.",0
"I can hear the fan, as well, which some people may find annoying.",0
(Todo): Excelente,0
"(Regret buying this laptop): This laptop is sleek, light and nifty. But has serious flaws.- The biggest one being that it simply refuses to wake up from sleep mode. I've tried various workarounds from the web but no success- The battery life is also not as long as advertised. Barely makes it to an hour fully charged- Its noisy. The fan runs constantly- Audio isn't great. And fan noise just makes it worseRegret buying this one. I would recommend you pay the extra bucks and go for the other much better brands out there.",0
Large screen with bright crisp graphics,0
"(Terrible keyboard, unusable as a laptop even around the house): Keyboard is impossible to get used to.I work in IT and I have used every laptop imaginable, from MacBooks (worst keyboard) to Dells and Lenovo.The keyboard layout here is just stupid. it's so bad . I pride myself on typing on ANHYTHING, but after six months I am still not able to use this as a laptop - it's basically a weak desktop for me now.The issue: the entire QWERTY letters are pushed to the left for give room to the numbers pad (as if they had to economize size here - the laptop is a tank no one is carrying this around), with no support, so you are left with a narrow are for typing, lots of room to put your right hand while your left hand is suspended in the air.Add the bad keyboard to the practically non existent battery life, the fact that it's extremely heavy and a charger that's heavier than my other laptop - and you got basically something that's not really a laptop .",0
"(Disappointed, trouble started upon opening it): So far I cannot give higher than 1 star, because I have just bought this product for my daughter's birthday. We opened it, charged and the laptop doesn't recognize any kind of internet connections, therefore it is unable to join the WiFi, therefore we couldn't even register the Microsoft Office, so we cannot use the whole computer. I know there is warranty and what not, but instead of using it, I need to send it back for repair...or take it to a local computer repair service provider. It's a very expensive, supposedly good quality laptop to go through this trouble from the get go. .",0
"(Could not power on after 5 days): I received my notebook 6 days ago.After using it for 5days, it could not charge or turn on anymore. I was shocked and disappointed after spending so much for something faulty.Now I had to spend more to ship it to MSI(US) for repair?! (btw I live in Sweden)",0
(Doesn’t support three monitors): Doesn’t support three monitors,0
"(It dictates!): It comes with a free upgrade to Windows11 and my husband surprised me with it, so I can write my book. This dictation feature makes it so much easier. You speaK slowly and you don't have to worry and fix typos, PLUS, it reads back so you can hear how it sounds! Fabulous!",0
Fan stays peacefully quiet,0
(Works): Nice laptop.,0
"(Contents chemicals known to the State California to cause cancer.): I wish that the item description had a disclosure about the statement for the State of California which is ""May content chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm'' Has good speakers, the screen really doesn't glare. But it contents lead (battery)",0
(Use and the price of a good notebook computer): Like this product there’s no touch screen,0
"(The Power and Flexibility to Meet My Needs): My new Asus VivoBook Pro is an awesome, amazingly lightweight laptop computer, considering all of its powerful features.I use mine for both programming, and various media content creation. Its dedicated graphics, and powerful multicore processor make it is so perfectly suited to my needs.The screen, with its weak viewing angle, is less than astonishing. I seem to want to move my head around when I try to take in the entire image on the screen. It is a sufficient enough monitor to get by with when away from a more significant monitor at home.This is my first laptop with a backlit keyboard. I love that I can get an at-a-glance overview of special keyboard function locations, as I find myself computing in low light, often. It’s just so awesome when lit up, and the lighting level is adjustable, for subtle lighting, as desired.I had my reservations about the lack of an optical drive, but I hot over that quickly; I borrowed the optical drive of an older laptop over my home network to install all of my software, and now I’m good to go with am ultra lightweight, ultra portable computing powerhouse. It’s quite luxurious, the lack of bulk.I have all the power I need with my Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM configuration. No practical computing task is beyond my capability.This machine games beautifully. The GeForce 1050 may be a few generations wise, but it plays current 3D titles with ease. It will handle anything I plan to throw at a laptop. I get the most responsive video editing power I’ve had to date, with smooth scrub navigation, and speedy rendering. And photo editing packages take full advantage of the VivoBook Pro’s remarkable computing power.I just love my Asus VivoBook Pro! The amazing set of built in convenience functions on backlit keyboard, the powerful multicore processor, the dedicated graphics power. Its high quality, kicking Harman Kardon audio is but icing on the cake, offering exceptional audio for an intense gaming experience.I have given several different laptop brands a chance over the years, and I must note that this Asus VivoBook Pro is my most enjoyable yet. The last time I loved a laptop this much was when dedicated graphics in the two-digit megabyte range was a big deal. So far, I am so enthusiastic about working on this laptop computer, because all of its capabilities, coupled with its sleek, gorgeous design, makes working on the Asus VivoBook Pro an absolute pleasure. This is my favorite laptop ever. I love it.",0
The contrast ratio and blacks really make the display pop.,0

(Very needed): Received at the right time to assist with job,0
"(Perfect little machine for internet surfers!): I chose this laptop for my 76y/o mom, who is not tech savvy. Her old laptop only had 2g ram and 24g hard drive — antiquated! She likes to watch YouTube videos, look at FB, and search Bible information.This laptop can do so much more if needed. For the price you can’t beat it. I think it could support MS Office Suite just fine and possibly even Quickbooks.I wouldn’t try gaming or heavy graphic editing software such at Adobe Photoshop or their Creative Cloud. I believe it would get bogged down.All in all a good laptop.",0
(nice for the money): very nice has what i need,0
having a very sophisticated unassuming design for those looking for a less noticeable gaming laptop,0
"(Best purchase!): After updating all the systems software on the computer and using it for a few weeks it still runs as expected and very well at gaming, typing, and student task. I would highly recommend this item to others because the value to performance factor is great on this laptop.",0
"(Five Stars): Kid tested, kid approved.",0
(Good laptop for gaming): Great product for the price and good battery life. Graphics are nice.,0
"(great quality laptop: fast, light and compact with excellent performance just ignore screenpad): i really like my zenbook; it's light, super fast with great battery life; i just can't get used to the screenpad, but that's OK because the screenpad can easily be disabled (f6) and it doesn't t seem to add much, if anything, to the cost. so.. it's a great quality laptop even without a screen on the mouse pad.",0
(the product): I like it's light weight,0
(Just Got It): Shipped quickly- seems just as advertised. So much better than the last one I had ! Can't say much more than that-haven't had it long enough -but so far so good !,0

"(Average computer for an above average price): I have owned this computer for almost 2 years now and all I can say is that it is very average. I would highly recommend building your own pc, you will have much better performance for the same price as this machine. Performance is ok but it has a hard time running a game with programs running in the background. The one thing good about this laptop is that it is pretty light and very portable.",0
This is a powerful gaming laptop that is lighter and thinner than I would have ever expected.,0
(E-learning win): What I needed to get my kiddos up and running for e-learning. Not touch screen though...,0
"(Best bang for the buck!): I shopped around a lot for i7 laptops with a powerful Nvidia GPU, and the Sager laptops were considerably less expensive than the competitors. I also appreciate the ability to easily upgrade the memory and hard drives. This laptop also has the standard SD card reader, which is being replaced by the Micro SD reader in some new laptops. You might like this laptop if you have a SATA drive from another laptop that you'd like to use in this one. There is a standard 2.5"" bay for a SATA drive, and two m.2 bays. It's not too difficult to get the back of the computer off. You just have to remove all of the screws and gently pry the front edges of the case apart. It's not too heavy, and has a small bezel around the display, which is vivid and bright. No complaints so far!",0
"(Nice above entry-level laptop): Our child is using this laptop for schoolwork which is primarily online work with some local activities (some programming software, picture cropping/editing) done on the computer itself.The specifications - processor, 8GB Ram, 256GB SSD - are very good and somewhat expected at this price point. The computer is responsive and capable and we have no complaints with it's performance. It is not a gaming laptop or something to use for editing a movie, but you can do just about everything you want with it.The screen is a matt finish and a bit dull. It doesn't really ""pop"" in any way. It's fine and functional but not going to win anyone over. 15"" makes for a larger laptop than needed - a 14"" or 13.5"" might be a better fit if portability is important. The case, which is plastic and textured, feels a bit cheap and show fingerprints readily. It's fine - nothing ugly - but not ""wow"".The trackpad is decent. It might take a little getting used to, but we found it reliable. For fine work you might want a mouse. It isn't top-of-the-line, but fully functional. The keyboard is comfortable but it is frustrating at times that it does not light up. At this price point the keyboard should be lit.This is a good computer - above the cheap entry level ones that are frustrating for performance and quality, but below the premium computers you might have to spend significantly more for. As such, it works nicely as an entry-level computer for a student or in a workshop.",0
(best seller): A++,0
"(For 400 dollars it will suffice.): A Very mediocre machine, you are paying 400 dollars for it. I bought it for my niece for school. No gaming, no advanced editing or engineering work. Streaming online, writting essays/ powerpoint, and watching movies is what this laptop will be good for. I understood this going in, so please don't expect a supercomputer.The people bashing this computer as slow? It's 400 dollars, what are you expecting?

I'll see if its adjustable, but it doesn't appear so. Setup was a breeze, was surfing the internet within 3 minutes. Battery charge seems to be excellent. So, Bang for Buck, you cannot go wrong. My demerits are on display qualities, but for under 200 dollars delivered, I have lowered expectations. This replaces my MacBook air.",0
(Unreliable): Ordered this about 7 weeks ago. It has stopped working several times. Battery area gets incredibly hot. Fan runs on high. Then the computer just crashes.I called tech support. Still having issues.Called again & they said I will have to return it for repairs. No refund allowed.I definitely would not recommend this product.,0

"(Lightweight with excellent battery life and screen. Stellar computational and thermal performance): Not much to say, excellent product overall. No cons except lack of ports. All day+ battery life, excellent screen. Keyboard is good as well. I have the 8 gb ram version but haven't seen any lag due to it. Use it often to run demanding simulations and it has not disappointed me so far.I was little concerned with the M1 chip and compatibility. However, x86-64 runs well enough, though CPU/ram usage is a bit higher (dropbox, for example). If you are using native versions, its far better than any x86-64 mobile cpus on market.",0

(Pure fire 🔥): It’s good...,0
"(Worst keyboard I've ever seen on a laptop): Unfortunately we got this as a gift for someone overseas, so unable to return it (or I would have). As others have mentioned, this keyboard has gray letters on silver keys. Almost no contrast unless you have perfect lighting (so in real life it often won't be anywhere as good as they picture they posted). Unfortunately the first times I used it before sending it off was daytime with excellent lighting, so I managed to get by. But in less than perfect lighting, it's a real strain to see the keys. I searched in vain to see if they had backlight (which is the only thing that could have saved things). Also, minimal tactile feedback. Unless you plan to always use an external keyboard, stay away from this laptop. Such a shame they never got user feedback on this keyboard design.",0
(This laptop is worth the miney): I’ve tried three laptops and none compare to the predator. The case feels solid and could take a drop. Response time is phenomenal.

I was delighted!,0
"(Economica y rendidora): como puntos malos: la laptop viene con teclado en ingles, le falta la tecla de los simbolos, mayor que, menor que. Hay que comprar unas calcomanias para volverlo 95% espa?ol, ademas de que cuesta un poco acostumbrarse a la tipografia, por otro lado, Los acabados del teclado parecen metalicos pero se sienten muy baratos al estar escribiendo la calidad es regular no se siente como algo premium 8mas bien medio chafon)Solo trae dos puertos usb 3.0 y ninguno mas, el usb type C, una ranura de memoria SD lo standard, conector hdmi normalito, siento que faltaron mas conectores para darle mas robustes a la conexion, aparte se tiene que comprar el puerto LAN a usb 3.0.Lo Bueno es que por su procesador y tarjeta de video integrada tiene un rendimiento bastante superior al incorporar el ryzen 5500 con 512mb de video dedicado de los 8GB que trae que vienen en dual, se puede cambiar por otras de 32Gb como maximo o unas de 16gb, algo caro tambien. Compatible con muchos juegos actuales que son competitivos y que tienen un rendimiento decente y con calidad media-alta, resident evil 2,3 remake, call of duty warzone, overwatch, league of legends, ideal si la quieres para jugar como para estudiar o hacer un poco de edicion de video pues su memoria y procesador lo permiten sin tantas complicaciones y con un rendimiento no el mejor pero bastante aceptable por su precio, la pantalla si es HD 1080p, por ultimo, el precio que no es digamos barato pero si es lo mejor que te puedes conseguir por tantito arriba de los 10 mil pesos a mi salio en 11300",0
(Screen flickering on new laptop): Received item and the screen on the laptop keep flickering.,0
(Great when it works): The good: excellent gaming laptop. Handles anything ive thrown at it.The bad: its possible i got a lemon. There is some issue that has developed the time ive owned it. I suspect the power supply or battery. If it goes to sleep the screen will not turn back on. If you plug in or unplug the laptop the screen shuts off and will not turn back on. If you rest a cell phone on the bottom left hand corner then the screen shuts off and you get a critical pathway failure error. The screen i feel is not as bright as i would like and the sound is not very loud even when maxed out. All in all im having to send it in to acer to have them try and fix it. I would not buy again and quite honestly wouldnt even risk a brand new replacement if i had a choice.,0

Thin and great battery life averaging 8-10 hours of use between charges. That's about once every 3-4 days of casual use for me. The only improvement I can think of is to make the keys a little more curved instead of flat. But other than that, it's a perfect laptop. Does not come with a huge amount of bloatware that needs to be removed. The speakers are not too bad either.The Dell XPS 13 may be better but at $1300 compared to this one at $750, this one is a much better value.",0
The colors were really beautiful.,0
"(2018 Newest Acer CB3-532 15.6"" HD Chromebook with 3x Faster WiFi,): would buy again",0
(Best price ever need to know what you want in a computer. Thank you amazon.): For virtual meeting with my employees.,0
"(nice machine but its not for me.): you can browse the internet and thats about all the machine is good for. 🤷🏼‍♀️ not gona work for me- i take and edit a lot of photos, download music etc.",0
(Buena relación costo beneficio): Ok,0
(Excellent computer for games...great value for the price....): I have an old gaming computer that it just hanging on right now. This new ACER is an outstanding upgrade. I have already downloaded some games (one game in particular involving tanks but I am not sure I am free to say which game/company it is) and it is great. The keyboard (picture above) lights up so that's a plus when I decide to play with the lights dimmed or off in the room). It has the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 which runs the games at top speed.This is a top notch quality computer for gaming at a great price. Outstanding. Five stars from this user!,0
"(Excellent Gaming Laptop): I have been struggling trying to find a good computer that will fulfill both my requirements based on Working and Gaming, laptops like this one are pretty rare to find, it doesnt heat at all, works fast, screen quality is amazing! Best decision i have made!!Pretty hyped!",0
(Can’t be charged after one year!): My chrome book can’t be charged after one year. I thought it was the battery problem. So I bought a new battery but it didn’t work. It should be the problem of the connection. Unfortunately the warranty is expired after one year. Now my chrome book is just a trash.,0
"(DOA): Bummed... Dead screen on arrival. The fans wouldn't even turn, sent it back and haven't reordered one yet.",0
"(Great product): I take online class and this laptop is very convenient. I love the size, screen quality is great. Its a bit heavy but not over the top, its manageable. Great price too.",0
(Good price): Nice computer,0
(Nice): Fingerprint reader is pretty much hit or miss.,0
"(Wish it had caps lock): Great bang for the buck. Touch screen works like a tablet. PC, easy to use, like a regular laptop. Great for surfing the net and an internet based business. Fingerpad takes some getting used to, so I bought a mouse to help me out. Head can in the front, a definite bonus whentalking with customers, online. Great thing about chrome books, is that everything can be saved on your google drive and/or Micro SD card. I use a 256 GB, for inventory, pics, email Nd I also back up to an external driver, as well as google drive.Very pleased with how easy it was to setup and get accustom to using, in place of a normal desktop. Oh! & it’s mobile too, so no more sitting at the desk all day",0
(Poor experiance and product): Product died within six months of using it due to the fact it would no longer charge. Contacted Amazon customer service for assistance who stated they could help but then retracted the offer when i asked what happens to my wrap around insurance coverage and to contact 3rd party seller directly. I've never had difficulty with customer svc ever with Amazon and I felt that they were about to help until I asked too many questions. Poor experiance and product.,0
(Todo): Todo,0
"(Fast boot-up time): Fast boot-up. ... Using crouton i installed Ubuntu 16, but there were problems, so i deleted Ubuntu and installed Kali-rolling which works. But with Kali i get (so far) no audio. For now, i don't need audio. Kali does work with USB peripherals like the HackRF and the Yardstick One.",0
"(An amazing laptop for students): I am a nursing student, and my old laptop (a Lenovo yoga) finally died on me after so many years. I needed an upgraded laptop for starting the nursing program. I did lots of research on various laptops that are great for students and I could not have chosen a better laptop. Although the laptop takes a few weeks to get used to, the keyboard set up is a bit different (nothing that causes any difficulty typing) and the screen is fairly large. The large screen works in my favor. I have the ability to split the screen between two windows, so I can simultaneously write my papers while referencing the article all in one. The memory on this laptop is amazing, and allows me to save my files in any form (pdf,word,open document,etc) making submissions for various classes easy. The fact that this is a google computer is one of the main reasons i love it so much. I have everything I need readily available and Google makes this a laptop that is super easy to navigate. 10/10 would recommend to any student. I'm not sure about gaming capabilities or anything outside of my academic needs, but I can't imagine that there is anything this laptop can do well.",0
"(Lightweight and easy to use): My district has provided Chromebooks for the students, but not the teachers. I decided to order this model for so I could familiarize myself with my students' experience. I now use it in place of a laptop and really enjoy it. It is lightweight and does not get hot. The battery lasts longer than my laptop. I did find myself getting headaches with extended use, so I ordered blue light glasses which solved the problem.",0
"(Great Laptop): Would have given it a five had it not been for the ridiculously delayed delivery. Laptop works great, been able to run emulators, and graphic heavy games with ease. Also works great with my 3D design softwares as well.",0
"(Unable to download updated chrome OS, unable to use): Received new and gmail wouldn't load properly because the old browser wasn't supported. Attempted to download new chrome OS and it took about 4 hours to download and wouldn't ever complete the process. Called acer and they said there was nothing they could do, they suggested I tried chromebook support which told me to powerwash the device and reboot. Which I did and nothing happened. Spent hours researching the problem, seems another user that ordered around black friday also had the same bug. Very frustrating experience. Will buy better chromebook x 360 (14 inch version) from Best Buy instead for $500 and peace of mind.",0
(Ok): Great speed. Screen is extremely dull.,0
"(Where's the ethernet plug): Seriously, I did not realize it had no ethernet plug until 2 days after the return window passed. Figures",0
this laptop feels very well built.,0
"(Good Product for the price): Light weight computer, works well. My old HP had windows 7 on it and I loved it so it is hard to figure out how to use Windows 10 for me but I am making progress. I would buy again.",0
"(Five Stars): Love this computer, what a great deal",0
"(4k gaming - EDITED slow computer): Delivery - 5/5 - Came after a week about without prime. Great speed!Packaging - 3/5 - Amazon, why did you send it without any packaging? Meh, it's ok I guess.Price - 5/5 - One of the best prices, but it is a budget build... for a 3070 with not much holding it back this is high up on the list for me though!Size - 5/5 - Great compared to my old sager from 4 years ago which I am switching from. So compact!Other points: Not 17 inches... but my TV is bigger so who cares? HDMI is on the side, not like my Sager4k Gaming - 5/5 - I am currently playing BreathEdge and its taking my breath away. This is a beast.So far so good!---Edit: Returned and upset1/5 - Promised headset for review, but no headset. No response. Form incomplete. Why provide this ad in the package and not give anything?1/5 - Performance was subpar. I got a Lenovo with 140w vs this thing sucking only half the electricity and giving half the performance for the same money, I mean I don't care for the electricity bill as much because my goal was a performance laptop when buying a GPU with 3070 on it1/5 - They ""misprinted"" the specs for this model on their own website1/5 - touchpad really bad, I mean I use a mouse, but this thing was pretty off, might as well not have a touchpad from it's quality1/5 - Cyberpunk was laggy here (like 25 frames a second and going to 15 or 10 every minute) vs playing smoothly on the new laptop5/5 availability - hard to get a good lenovo laptop",0
"(Keyboard takes a little getting used to.): The speed is great. It is light and does everything I need. The missing delete, home, end and other keys means that I have to work a little differently, but not much.",0
"(This Model Has No SD Card Slot): I bought this specifically for gaming, but does not come with an SD Card slot. Not a big deal, but for something this high end, you would expect all the bells and whistles.",0
(Gaming laptop with main Ports in back big plus): Almost perfect for $1000 laptop. 8 cores cpu 16gb ram can upgrade to 32gb. 1660ti gpu handles most games on high settings. 512gb m.2 storage with extra m.2 slot. Main ports in rear makes laptop looks clean on desk 144hz screen great for csgo and call of duty. Great gaming specs.Cons: fans make a little noise in heavy gaming not too bad. Laptop is a little heavy.,0
(CALIDA PRECIO): Un buen producto relacion calidad precio con el inconveniente que los parlante no suenan bien en cuanto a calidad del sonido y tampoco tienen buena potencia,0
(Would buy again): Good speed,0
(No costumer service!): I ordered a helios predator 300 N came in everything looks fine but I take a glance at the number key and the whole key is poped out the keyboard...,0
"(A fantastic laptop! Apple's best MacBook Air yet.): I absolutely love this laptop. I'm a software engineer and as you can imagine I spend a lot of time of the computer. This computer is lightning fast, a dream to type on, and it has a beautiful screen. The only downside is that camera quality, which is absolutely atrocious. I have a desktop PC that I do my web conferencing over anyways, so it's not big deal for me. If you really care about the webcam, I would suggest purchasing a third-party webcam. Other than that, I highly recommend this product and I could not be more pleased with it.",0
(Good quality): Right size,0
"(Computer Had Hardware Problem But Dell Stepped Up And Fixed It.): [Update 12/20/2018] I worked with Dell on this issue and finally had to send the computer back to Dell for service. They replaced the main board and the computer seems to be working fine. Credit here to Dell for standing behind their product.But going through the diagnosis and repair is a pain. The technical support people wanted to eliminate all the software possibilities so we kept trying things including a clean re-install of Windows - which wiped my machine.After we eliminated all the software possibilities, Dell sent me a box and I shipped it back to them on a Tuesday. I received the unit back on the following Wednesday.But this is all things that shouldn't have happened. The computer should have operated properly when I received it. Perhaps it was defective and was not refurbished properly. It would have been worth a few extra dollars to avoid all of this service headache.Note that this is not a ding on Dell but on the company who claimed to refurbish the computer. Dell stepped up and fixed the unit.+++++++++++++++++++[Update] I'm experiencing a problem with this computer in that it gives a Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD) occasionally. It recovers from the BSOD and goes back to normal operation. I'm working with Dell now to find a solution. They believe it's a software problem but if that were correct, it seems that everyone would be having the BSOD problem. I'll post a follow-up after I work with Dell some more. Really disappointing. I've never had a computer that was this unreliable.++++++++++++++I've only had the computer for a couple of days - it's a refurb unit. The computer was clean and unmarked - looked like new. Setup was normal and the unit functions like I'd expect a new computer to function.It was packed well and was shipped quickly. Not much else to say - I'll have to wait until I have more time with it to see if any problems crop up. I thought the price was fair considering it has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. I'll probably have to upgrade it to a 1TB SSD at some point in the future - I checked the maintenance manual and an upgrade looks pretty easy.",0
(A refurbished Laptop): I was under the impression it was new. 2.9 speed is not correct.,0
"(Highly recommend for the price!): Absolutely perfect laptop for the price. It already has great cooling but I have the laptop on a Thermaltake RGB cooler for good measure and airflow. The predator software for thermal monitoring is excellent and you can customize how fast the fans go. I was able to install a 1TB SSD and another 1 TB NVME SSD for games. Be warned that by doing this you're potentially voiding the warranty, so make sure you're grounded and have the correct tools if you choose this route. The keyboard is okay, I ended up buying a Razer Hunstman TE so I rarely use the laptop keyboard. Overall I would not sleep on this laptop I'm very happy for buying it and I think every gamer would as well.",0
"(Much more machine than any Chromebook!): Fast, light, good battery life. Not using it for big number crunching, but good for small business. I’m not a gamer, so can’t speak to that. However Windows 11 is nice.",0
(Christmas gift): This laptop is exactly as described in the description. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.,0
"(Works as expected): Not sure about the ""S"" mode. Didn't engage it yet as I heard it really slows the system down and you cant revert back once you make the change. Not a gamers computer. Seems very good for household use.",0
The keyboard is fantastic,0
(great laptop): plays videogames smoothly,0
(This product has very limited use.): Will not accept Windows or any other software.,0
"(Good Computer): Received my item when a scratch on the screen and it's supposed new. The @ and quotation marks keep on switching. Box was left at the door in the rain and they didn't even ring the door bell. Otherwise, good computer.",0
"(Good value in a laptop): I bought this for my wife, who teaches English at a small university in Zimbabwe. She LOVES it!! She doesn't game with it, so doesn't need a super-fast computer. She loves the solid feel and the quick reactions. So far it does everything she needs to do with it.",0
"(No audio and overheats): I bought and received this on 5/19/2021. It would not play audio, instead the speakers would crackle. After being on for more than 15 minutes the fans would stop working and the keys would get hot. This is when being used on a hard wood table with nothing around.Physically looked fine. Called the amazon Acer support and they suggested reinstalling drivers, factory resetting then sending for repair. Not impressed, I am going to have the return label for this printed soon and sent back (thank you Amazon for helping with return).",0
"(Surpass expectation, bad rollover): **Update on 31 July: After using for half of a month**So after more usage I realized more downside of this machine. The most unforgivable one is the rollover. FYI, rollover means the max amount of keys the keyboard can detect at once. The number is very inconsistent, but I realize it can't detect W, A and Esc at the same time. Just THREE keys. And three keys commonly pressed by the left hand. It's worse than the much cheaper non-gaming-laptop keyboard model I used before, an ASUS vivobook. I checked and it seems rollover is an hardware issue, meaning there's no way I can change it without using an external keyboard. Because of this I have downgraded the score from 4 stars to 3 stars.Then, the speakers quality.....is really not good if you're listening to some good music.And then the heat issue. The good thing is heat control on the central components (CPU, GPU) is not bad. The bad thing is heat accumulates a lot above the keyboard....Basically the area above F3 to F11. It gets really hot. Well, there's no key there so you won't normally touch it, but if you're running some stuff and close your screen.....Your screen can also get really hot. Hope it won't damage the screen.**End of update on 31st July**Bought this laptop from US store because there's only 144Hz 62%sRGB trash screen version locally, which is Taiwan. Yes, TAIWAN, WHERE ASUS IS FROM.Anyways. I read many reviews before deciding to buy this machine and it actually performs better than I expected. For example, many people complained of heating issues. I haven't tried playing some ultra-demanding game or prolonged stress test, but for some popular MMORPG, I can play it at ~90% best appearance in crowded meta-event area on my lap. Literally a laptop. And the heat level of both the CPU and GPU still goes below 80 degree C most of the time and never goes above 85, while still performing the expected benchmark scores. I'm super lazy and love to play on my bed with the laptop sitting on my legs so that's really nice.Fans are noisy on turbo mode, but that's expected. As long as they do their job I'm fully content.And the screen. It's surprisingly well, especially when the screen is not the selling point of this machine. Both this machine and the screen of my gf's years-old macbook pro have a 100% sRGB rating, but this machine looks better. And thanks to the ""game visual"" feature in the Armoury Crate app you can change saturation, contrast etc. based on the situation...I find it quite pog.All the CPU GPU ram ssd stuff are running well from benchmark checking (though I encountered slight difficulties). Impressive.There're 3 default modes, I think it's already shown on the description. You can change mode from simply pressing fn+F5. Apart from the MUX mode, there's also a ""Windows"" mode.....I dunno what it is, and doing completely fine without it.These are the good stuff.Now, I find the audio and speakers mixed with good and bad. It gives me a good 3D feels and the sound quality is also good. But the down side is it sounds like it's preset with a mixer. For example, when you listen to a pop song...You will hear rich instrumental sound, rich base, but the singer's voice become less acute and kinda ""foggy"" compared to an ordinary speaker (and the years old macbook).It still sounds good. But maybe not so good if you love to hear sounds clearer on the high pitch end.Now the down side.Despite I bought a new machine, some driver software are already out-of-date. There was once I restarted the machine and realize the screen is tearing like a broken one. I was like holy sh_t if I gotta return it and buy another one it would be another month for me without a computer...Luckily the Nvidia kicked in and updated the software automatically and restarted the machine. The screen is nice for now.Similarly, it took me some time to figure out what to do when the 3060 GPU ""disappeared"" despite the power is plugged in. If you're a pro gamer or someone familiar with PC there should be no problem for you. Just took some hours to figure out the settings and everything is fine. But imagine if someone is switching from Mac to this machine....Would be a terrible day.Front cam is terrible, but more than enough for working or meeting. But don't rely on it for taking some actual video. Keyboard lighting is surprisingly cool.Generally speaking at its listed price it's a really good value for money. I gave it 4 stars because I think some super discounted machine on Amazon deserve that 5 stars....But those are usually sold out within 1 or 2 hours, so it requires some luck to get one. If you're not trying your luck, this one is really nice.And I hate it why you can charge the laptop on USB-C in the ROG series, but not on this one! Though, I believe that can be solved by simply adding an adapter...",0
"(Nice): Beautiful picture. Holds many of my graphic softwares and works seamlessly. Battery lasts about 2-3 hours, depending on the amount of use. The battery pack is huge and heavy. Maybe a downfall, but I’m ok with it.",0
(Super item): Great purchase for the money.,0
(Battery Life is amazing): This thing never dies!! Powerful enough for any student,0
(Satisfaction): Very happy & satisfied..,0
"(Excelente): Lo muy rápido que llego a pesar de estar cuarentena.No estaba convencido si llegaría en buenas condiciones por lo que se entregaría al extranjero a Peru 🇵🇪.Pero quiero resaltar el trabajo y la labor de Amazon.La seguridad que ofrece a sus clientes muchas gracias.La computadora de mucha capacidad,muy delgada,modelo nuevo,fácil de instalar y llego en perfectas condiciones",0
"(Bad, failed after 3 months.): I used this for 3 months and it failed; gave it to their local lab that said they will not cover the warranty, and that the motherboard has failed.Do not buy this.",0
(Good): Battery life isnt all that but in all it's a great laptop,0
(It ok): I guess for the money.. but soon after you will be frustrated with performance..Not powerful,0
"(Product return): Feel bad about my 1 star rating from earlier. Hope this evens it out. Had one issue - S letter on keyboard came off, while using.Returned with no issues. Original order came in very quickly. Computer was clean and looked to be in overall good shape. Only issue was with the keyboard. Again, returned and they were quick to approve.",0
"(Great unit for decent price!): Bought this chromebook at xmas time to replace our ageing Windows based laptop. First let me say, I don't miss Windows at all. This machine is very fast and handles almost everything we needed windows. My main concern was the use of Turbo Tax software that I used to install locally on the windows laptop. I solved the issue by using Turbo Tax online version using the chrome browser. I do have simple tax requirements and this worked out fine.If you are considering a Chromebook, do yourself a favor and get the 4 gig ram version. Yes, more money, but well worth it. I have installed a program called ""Crouton"" which allows you to install ""Ubuntu"" Linux which will run in a ""Chrome"" browser tab. This allows you to run any Linux based programs on the Chromebook.Battery life is very good also, depending on the usage level. 6-8 hours is normal in my case. The ""full"" HD resolution of this model is also well worth the extra cost vs a lower cost unit with the less than ""full"" resolution. (768i vs 1080i)I did a lot of research into Chromebooks before buying this HP model and am glad I did. I was able to buy this at xmas on sale for $229.00. The next time this model goes down to that price level, I may buy a second one.",0
"(Unreliability is this laptop’s ‘best’ feature): Bad design justifies the low cost, have only had issues with this one. Weak hinge(read shaky screen), poor speakers and aweful screen lighting(yellow tinge) were starters but things I could live with. Now the laptop fails to turn on despite being connected to the charging cord. ASUS customer service like the ‘concept of good design’ is not available. Would highly recommend you to stay away from this shoddy design. The ‘good’ reviews that tricked me into getting this product are highly misleading.",0
(Don't buy): This laptop sucks. Don't buy a Chromebook. Get something with Windows.,0
"(I HATE this laptop... The WIFI keeps shutting off and it deletes itself completely from the system): The laptop has to be shut off and restarted. NO USING the RESTART function either. I have to shut it down, wait a bit, then start it for the WIFI to reappear. All work is lost! And, you can not add anything to the task bar! All the sites I frequently use, can not be dragged & added. WTH? I have had this laptop less then 24 hours and I absolutely HATE IT!",0
"(Great Gaming Laptop): Great laptop for gaming at friends houses. I can run Halo Infinite 45-50 fps with all graphics settings on high. You will need to have its power plugged in while playing taxing games like halo or call of duty, because this beast will end its battery life.",0
"(Satisfied with the price and specifications): Amazing price at SGD$336 including shipping during Black Friday Sales. No GST charged. Good specifications such as i3. This laptop has extra Sata and Ram slots, easy to open casing for installation of HDD/SSD and Ram upgrades. Keyboard is not lighted. Casing a bit filmsy.",0
(Small and extremely light and easy to operate): Fast delivery. Laptop is exactly what I wanted.Small and extremely light and easy to operate.,0
(arrived in time overall a great chromebook): touch screen for work and entertainment,0
"(Lasted One Month after Warranty Expires): Great build and price like everyone else says, but it comes with its set of problems for sure. The battery life is non-existent, good lucking playing anything except solitaire for more than 45 minutes to an hour. It runs super hot, can only use on a cooling pad or it is unbearable on your skin or clothing. Also after 2 years of ownership, it pretty much doesn't run any games as it overheats usually within 15 minutes, even after running fans on max, with a cooling pad and suction for hot air add-on can not cool it down. Basically have an overpriced chromebook now. So now I need to buy another laptop, will be trying another brand or getting extended warranty.",0
"(Good basic computer): Bought in January for a work from home job that I needed a decent laptop for. Works well with Teams, video quality is ok, but I'm not using it for gaming. Only 1 HMDI port- which is kind of annoying when you'd like to connect it to multiple monitors. Another annoyance is that it will sometimes disconnect from home WiFi- which is inconvenient (to put it mildly) when you need to be online for work. Other than that it's an inexpensive machine that for the most part does what it's supposed to.",0
"(Decent for the price.): I had to do a bit of research to get the best bang for the buck for a budget gaming PC. Mainly using it to browse web, do some coding, and photoshopping. Nitro 5 is the first gaming laptop I've owned but I also owned other gaming desktop currently as well.Laptop arrived in good condition, and I immediately set it up. Charged it for an hour until it reaches 90% and then installed all the necessary updates. Do note that the laptop is a grease and fingerprint magnet. I find myself cleaning it with a microfiber towel and rubbing alcohol for the keys and palm rest every few days.A week later, I added another SATA SSD to the caddy they provided. I used the HDD cable that came with the laptop and installed a Crucial SSD 1TB. Then comes the 32GB RAM upgrade from the stocked 8GB. Ordered a Corsair 32GB (16GB x 2) 2666MHz SODIMM ram sticks and installed it. Crucial stated that this laptop can maxed out at 64GB RAM for the AN515-54-5812 Nitro 5 (2020).It's been a month since the purchase, and I haven't gotten into any other issues since then. Fan does run high at times, especially on High Performance mode spinning at 4K+ RPM.",0
"(Great gaming laptop): I got this just to try it out. I play a lot of wireless VR on my Vive Pro and Quest 2. I figured this would be ok at it but thankfully it blew my mind. Yeah it is very loud when you turn the fans/turbo on but it seems to have great cooling. In VR, I don't notice it. Didn't think it could play VR well without a cable and thankfully I was wrong. Had an old router I hooked up and it is flawless, almost better than my i78700k, 3080, 16 gig ram (less than 300hz). Nice desktop I have but my mobo is a bit slow.Anyway, I used the laptops hot spot and still could play vr, maybe like a 4/10 but now, with the dedicated old router, easily a 8.5/10. Fricken awesome.Oh yeah, took one star off because the battery is not very long lasting.",0
(Does the job): Great for the price point!,0
"(excelente portatil , marca acer): excelente calidad y rendimiento , la marca acer reconocida en el mundo",0
"(Great chromebook for price.): I have been using it for a several months now. Writing review on it right now. I love this chromebook. It's my 3rd in about 10 years and so far so good with no problems. Screen quality is good. I have used it for Zoom calls and video messaging and it works as well as my work laptops that are considered top notch and cost 3-4 times as much.I don't game on it but streaming netflix, prime, disney+, shopping, writing documents, browsing the internet, writing emails, video calls and messaging are all awesome and work excellent.",0
"(Nice & durable laptop): Quite nice laptop. Arrived in its original package with all all the stickers and the power brick. Been using & testing every inches of it since 14 June 2022, absolute amazed & don't regret buying this laptop at all. Totally worth the money I spent on this laptop.About the thunderbolt port, didn't get the chance to test it yet. About the screen, there is not much bleeding, the color & brightness is ok, however don't update to the latest intel UHD graphic driver as it will render the screen color & brightness totally inaccurate, had to revert back to the old version. The performance is incredible, didn't test the MUX switch yet. The keyboard & touchpad is quite nice, everything placed perfectly, the RGB & its brightness is quite nice, sad that it doesn't support per-key RGB.Runs a little bit hot with the fan a little bit loud when doing stuff like gaming & other things that requires high processing power, but that's OK, It is bearable.Had an issue with the microphone as was too loud & inaccurate in the receiver end, had to use an earphone with external mic. Thought it was a hardware issue, but after a bit of research, uninstalled the C-Media Audio Driver & reinstalled all of it through My Asus software. Easy process & now works perfectly.",0
(I really like the laptop but we need something to update the driver): Laptop is great but we are unable to update the driver's since windows update does update all driver. I'm currently getting driver incompatibility error on windows 11 because windows updates doesn't update the driver. It would be great if they had an app that would allow us to update the driver. I searched on the web but found no results/ solution.,0
(Quality refurbish): Pretty good so far. Performs as advertised.,0
(Love my X1 Carbon): I watched videos that talked about how good the keyboard feels. They were right. Replaced my macbook air with this X1 Carbon. Using it for work and personal use. Very happy,0
The battery life is not quite as good as my last ASUS Vivobook.,0
"(Amazing laptop): Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully! The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.",0
"(Great for basic needs, but battery life is a lie): I get about 4.5 hours out of a full charge, and all i do is word processing and audio books. 11 hours seems like an impossibility unless there is something i am completely missing.",0
"(Great Laptop Overall): First of all, this laptop is great for gaming. Keyboard and screen is flawless but it has a serious heating issue. But you can solve it with lowering CPU frquency (from power plan) or start cooler boost (it's very loud) and using a headphone. I had the fan clicking sound at fastest fan speeds. It disappeared after I accidentaly spill some water on it(don't try it). Body gets fingerprints very easily and it's annoying. It has a second 2.5 drive space and I installed an SSD. It's hard to open the case but be gentle, feels like it can brake easily. And lastly, it has some pointy edges on it's body, you may get uncomfortable when using it on your lap.",0
(Good machine): This unit work as expected,0
"(No camera and touch pad issues): No camera from the start but problems have increased since thenTouch pad works off and on and now as laptop warms up, laptop freezes up and there is no response. Have called service and put on hold. What good is customer service and Warranty service if product fails just out of the box. If this is AMD products I will go back3/28/21 - update after several updates and several phone calls to Amazon who have been more than helpful.. the computer is working ok with the exception of the camera that works but is so blurry it cant be used.. will keep you updated",0
(For college): Bought this for my niece for college. She’s fluent in the Google O/S after using it in high school and likes it a lot. Hope it will serve her well.,0
"(Thorough Laptop Review for Gaming): Here is what I bought: 2022, 17.3 Inch QHD 165Hz 100% DCI-P3, Intel i7-12700H, RTX 3060, 32GB RAM, 2TB NVMe SSD, TBT 4, Win 11My thoughts.17 in: Is pretty big and amazing.2TB: Gaming, some photo/video storageRTX 3060: Good. Id give it 8 out of 10. I can run my newer titles on High, sometimes Epic/Ultra. FPS 80+32GB: I feel 32GB is not necessary but nice as apposed to 16GB for future usageOverall: for $2000 this laptop gets an 8 out of 10. The fans are very loud, build quality is OKAY... Performance is good, not amazing but good. I give this laptop as of 2022 a 2-3 years of high quality gaming shelflife and 3+ years of standard video editing and med to low graphic gaming.My setup: I use this laptop for when I get off work I can game at work. I sleep 4 nights at work so I mostly game. 1 external, keyboard, mouse and monitor.Final thoughts: As of the date of this post everything is overpriced or out of stock. (I can't wait for a new president.) If you're in the market for a gaming laptop I would most certainly recommend this. You're value for dollar is going to serve you well here. Keep in mind the build quality is OKAY and the fans are very loud. In otherwords handle with care and don't expect to discreetly game in your cubical. If your like me and you just want performance without the bells and whistles this laptop does it. You can travel with, take it to work, camping, sit on the couch or make it your main rig with duel monitors.",0
"(Awesome Laptop!): This laptop is incredible! I originally thought that since the video card isn't that great (The can you run it website told me I wouldn't be able to run most games even on the minimum settings) that I'd have issues with gaming. But so far I've been able to play everything I've tried. Even Final Fantasy 14, and I generally keep unity up at all times and even then no lag. Its crazy fast. Will definitely be sticking with Asus.",0
(Satisfied customer): Very elegant and stylish for any age.,0
"(It's basically a gaming-focused thinkpad!!!): I love thinkpads. Durable. Portable. Powerful. Upgradable... or, at least they USED to be.I'll keep it brief: if you miss the understated, over-engineered (in a good way), user serviceable thinkpads of the past (before they started soldering in the ram, using low power U-series chipsets, and whatnot), if you do any color critical work, if you are a closet gamer, or a video editor on the go, BUY THIS LAPTOP.Its build is reminiscent of the W540 (to my eye, at least), with the 15.6"" display (bright and color accurate), offset keyboard and trackpad, narrow numpad, and dropped arrow keys, it seems the only things missing is a trackpoint nub and the W540s lackluster performanceIt is thoughtfully engineered, in that, its design elements are not based on fads or flash... the engineers seemed to be focused on an internal layout that prioritizes thermals, which in turn allows you to get the best possible performance, and basically every choice feels deliberate and justified, instead of pandering to fickle market trends. the designers showed and incredible amount of restraint, and i commend them for it.I bought this for use with Davinci Resolve (4k editing and color grading), Adobe Lightroom, Pro Tools, Ableton Live, light coding, and light gaming. I use this for work primarily, but it's nice to know that when i have time and the inclination, i can game on this without having to consult canirunit.com.I highly, HIGHLY recommend this laptop. It is my opinion that this laptop, in this configuration, has the best price to performance ratio of any other ""gaming"" laptop in 2020.It is a gaming Thinkpad.",0
"(Don't buy this laptop): I buyed this laptop few months ago. The battery life this below 2 hours, yes, only 2 hours, and for activities like wacht a netflix or browser the web. The touch pad and the usb port did't work for some lapse of time.I really dissapoint with this laptop, I live abroad EEUU so warranty it's no available.",0
"(Buena compra.): Desde que la recibí y hasta ahora me ha funcionado perfectamente. Muy buen desempeño. Enciende en solo 4 segundos y tiene muy buen sonido. Le tengo habilitado el modo para extender el tiempo de vida de la bateria con el que carga solo hasta 79% y con ello puedo trabajar hasta 2 horas con office utilizando un brillo de pantalla de 40%. No he probado hasta ahora cuanto tiempo me puede durar una carga del 100% pero le estimo aproximadamente de 2.5 a 3 horas con un plan equilibrado. Me ha funcionado muy bien con programas de cálculo y diseño CAD. Es la primera vez que compro la marca ASUS, por lo que espero no me decepcione.Como punto malo es el espacio limitado de almacenamiento por lo que es necesario instalar una segunda unidad de disco duro para poder disponer de ello. Lo bueno es que si cuenta con el puerto de conexión SATA para unidades de disco duro convencionales o de estado sólido según se prefiera. Solo que la unidad deberá ser slim (de los modelos más delgados) puesto que el espacio es reducido.",0
"(What a laptop!): I have had this model for a little over 2 months and have found it to be an excellent laptop. It is small, light weight and very easy to lug around in my backpack. Yet, for a small lightweight laptop, it has some of the best features I have ever seen for such a small size. First off, with the i7, 16GB of RAM and a 256 SSD, it is blazing fast! I can login in just a few seconds and with the facial recognition, I don'y even have to type in a password. Next is the display, the UHD edge display is bright, vivid and really brilliant with color rendition. The color rendition is really close to perfect. Then comes the keyboard and mousepad. Both are responsive, quick and easy on the fingers for typing and navigating. Also, there is an external MicroSD slot to expand the memory (I use it for movies).As a downside, the laptop seems to ""hick-up"" from time to time with the external mouse not working properly. But it only seems to occur when an update to the BIOS is needed. Its as if the system seems to know there is an update waiting to be installed and the indicator (besides the notification) is the mouse not working properly. Finally, I have not used the built in speakers as I use headphones when playing music or watching a movie.Overall, would I recommend this laptop? Yes, it it worth the costs and it's a delight to use. So much so, I stopped using my Macbook Pro (13 inch) as well as my Thinkpad X1 Carbon (6th generation).",0
"(Good and bad): This laptop is definitely an ideal college laptop for students who want both performance and portability. The weight is crazy light, which means it had to sacrifice the build quality. That's where the bad part comes in. The cooling system is bad. Would heat up even if just browsing the internet or doing light editing in Photoshop/Premiere Pro. I wouldn't say its hot to the touch but its definitely quite warm that you can feel it. No worries though, just toggle on high-performance mode in Samsung settings and that issue will not really be a problem anymore. After all, its an I7 12th gen chip, which is power-hungry so it makes sense for this to happen in such a compact laptop. Speakers are also loud as you can see from my video. Overall definitely worth it if you want to stay in the Samsung ecosytem.",0
(Read description clearly !!!!!!!): It didn’t see refurbished on the description. I got it today and it shut on me. It is refurbished not new. I’m returning it. I need a refund.,0
"(Quick & Reliable): This is a nice, quick computer with some limitations. It is nice to have the Windows update. The keyboard is of a good design and easy to use. The one thing I should have paid attention to when I bought it was it doesn't have a DVD/CD drive. Other-than-that, my wife and I are really happy with it. Its light weight, compact, easy to use. We bought it during the yearly sale that Amazon has on most of their products. We saved a bundle on this computer. All-in-all, we are very satisfied.",0
(Good value): Great value and no complaints so far. It’s he size of a chrome book but has all the laptop features.,0
(Great Tool): Nice chromebook. Really helpful tool for Dungeons and Dragons 😂,0
"(POWERFUL Gaming Rig With Better-Than-Anticipated Performance!): I recently purchased a Dell laptop for around the same price that I, unfortunately, had to return because 1. Dell sent me one that didn't have the light-up keyboard I paid extra for and 2. it had major performance issues. Dell also took nearly an entire month to ship me a replacement so I told them to just keep their crummy laptop and get me a refund.That brought me to a KILLER deal on this laptop and it arrived in two days!I was extremely pleased to find out that this laptop goes well beyond the recommended specs for high-quality VR gaming as I am considering purchasing a Vive down the line. I tested performance on a few games including Subnautica (amazing game) and was super-impressed at how well everything looks while running really smoothly. It does get pretty warm while running games but that's common with high end computers. I would recommend purchasing a cooling pad with this computer.The battery life does fluctuate often but generally you can get between 2-3 hours of battery life for simple applications such as surfing the internet while you may only get one hour while playing games. That's perfectly fine because the performance is AWESOME and I rarely need more than a couple hours of unplugged use at a time.All-in-all I find very few cons with this computer as it's so darned powerful and very sleek in design. I recommend you purchase this as long as you aren't expecting battery life over 3 hours. Good luck finding that, however, when looking for a powerful gaming laptop.",0
this laptop exceeded my expectations and is definitely worth the price.,0
(No Bluetooth as advertised!!!): I am returning this laptop. It is advertised to have Bluetooth and doesn’t. I have to have Bluetooth. This is now going to be such a hassle to return and have to order another laptop......after checking to make sure that the seller’s description is accurate!,0
"(Worth all $1400 I paid for it): Excellent gaming laptop. Was available for $1,400, which is a great value for the sum of its parts.Gaming - this is what its for. The 2070 RTX card benchmarks at around the previous gen's 1080 GTX, although it's supposed to have optimized support for ray-tracing (I've not seen that yet, don't have any games that have that feature). The 10th gen i7 is a slightly better version of my 7th gen i7, which 6 cores instead of four. in short, this is a slightly better computer than my 3 year old gamer rig only its way more mobile. It's not a Switch, you'll have to plug in the laptop to get the most out of modern games, but it's perfect when it's plugged in.You'll want a gaming mouse, a headset, and a controller to go with this. If you have a second monitor, I'd recommend a G-sync or FreeSync monitor to make sure you're not letting any of those precious frames go to waste.Nitpicks -Speakers are quiet, fan is loud. When the fan is blasting, it becomes difficult to hear what's going on in the game. Can't do much about the fan - you've got to cool the GPUs and CPUs. They could have made the speakers a bit louder, or maybe they could have placed them in a better position. It's a minor gripe, just wear a headset.",0
"(2 HUGE flaws!): The battery life is great! Maybe the most redeeming quality. I personally like the way the backlit keyboard feels (layout and key travel). Performance is also great with the 8th gen CPU and SSD. Boots up and off in less than 10 seconds. Very portable and sleek looking.CONS:There are TWO very big cons I have!!!The screen has good specs for the price and it shows it. HOWEVER, the screen FLICKERS very often. Ive tried resetting the drivers and even deleted ALL foreign apps the laptop didn't come with. Still happens and it's only gotten more frequent. The TOUCHPAD stutters and STOPS RESPONDING every 15-20 minutes. Using the laptop is very difficult with this flaw.",0
"(Fast and reliable): SSD makes start up and work fast and easy. Light, portable and functional. Great laptop.",0
(Great value): It has functioned perfectly so far. Had a very quick 90 minutes of updates and there are no issues with remote access of my office computer. Solid buy for the price.It is not a touch screen like a couple other reviews say.,0
The screen is bright(!) with sharp resolution,0
"(Quite Disappointed): I had like this laptop at first but after just a year of usage, the fan stopped working, cracks everywhere and touchpad buttons are too loose. the shell feels like cheap material and it scratches easily.",0
(Good performance): Good price.,0
"(amazon is the best!): excellent product,best service!",0
"(Great for mobile computing): I purchased this base model Macbook Air M2 for attending online courses through a university. I've been mainly a Windows PC user for a while now. My last Macbook was an old 12-inch Macbook Pro G4 (remember those mini-me/Yow Ming commercials?).After being able to use this laptop for a couple of months, I've decided that given the current state of technology within my home, my future personal computers will most likely be all Apple, as long as I continue to use iPhones, AppleTVs and Apple Accessories (such as AirPods). The current form of the MacOS allows easy use of printers/scanners and any other computer peripheral you may need.With all that said, I will say that you should consider this base model for the following reasons:- You currently have an Apple ecosystem.- You need a lightweight, small form-factor laptop for basic computing needs.- You primarily run cloud-based platforms that don't require local storage.- You'd like to work ""unplugged"" for many hours without having to charge the laptop.- You enjoy a bright monitor and a pretty decent keyboard to type on.At the same time, I would NOT recommend this model if you need the following:- You'll be running large programs that require a lot of local storage.- You require a machine that will process/render high-resolution media. The lack of a fan will cause the Macbook to thermal throttle, lowering your performance. For a little more, you're better off going with the base model Macbook Pro.- Gaming (Thermal throttle will lower framerates).A few honorable mentions:- Despite the lack of larger, more visible speakers, the sound is decent for this category of laptop.- The low power requirements make this an easy travel laptop, not requiring that you bring a huge brick to keep this thing going.- The redesigned look is a lot nicer than the previous generation (I'm glad the wedge design is gone).Finally, regarding value:Considering where we are in tech today, I feel that for the money, we should no longer have base models with only 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD space. At the very least, I really hope that Apple would consider making their base models start at 16GB of Ram and 512GB of SSD storage without increasing the price. At the very least, if they keep the 256GB of SSD, give the option to keep an SD card on board without having to attach an external drive every time you want expanded storage.",0
"(Great product, but bad QC issues): Great product at first, but the laptop's screen soon stopped turning on less than a day in.",0
"(Good, but missing two important functions): Missing two things:1-No delete button. You have to use the back button2-No way to turn off the touch padOtherwise, good for the price.",0
(Truly remarkable and amazing): I bought this item for a 13 yr old for Christmas and she has enjoyed this every hour of the day thus far. She has taken this to school to help her with her test and homework,0
(I purchased it less than two months ago and the ...): I purchased it less than two months ago and the screen was broken (only shows several colorful lines and it is not due to any physical damage).,0
"(Decent, but buy a spare power adapter): I purchased this for light home use, mostly by my second grader for virtual schooling. So far, it also gets used to play some games from the Windows store and Sims 4. Overall, we have been happy. ASUS generally puts out a good product.However, I docked a star for two reasons:1) customer support is terrible. My laptop stopped charging after 2 months. Root cause - bad power adapter. Instead of sending me a new adapter to try, they had me send my laptop in. It was 3 months before I got my laptop back. It was a long and frustrating story, and though everyone I spoke to was very nice, the lack of communication on their part was appalling.2) the adapter that comes with it is incredibly fragile. After the initial debacle with the power supply, the new one they sent me when they returned my laptop stopped working within 3 months. Replacing the adapter with an after-market has worked fine so far.For the price, this has been a good laptop. Just do yourself a favor and get a spare adapter for when the original breaks.",0
(Came with laptop and charger. Great ?? buy): Great buy for my cousin I saw The same one for $200 more at best buy so this was my best choice . Came with charger that’s all it said.,0
"(meet my needs): This laptop has a large hard disk drive and just under 7 gigabytes of ""usable"" RAMs. This laptop accomplishes my work and personal tasks. It's fairly zippy online. The touch screen is a nice addition. The display is clear and readable in gray or small fonts. It's functional and aesthetic enough to meet my needs.",0
(Awesome): Great product,0
(Great value for an everyday laptop): Great laptop for the price was very surprised with this quality laptop at the price. Will recommend!,0
(Really nice laptop): Beautiful and looks really nice. Quality looks like true Apple quality. Battery life is respectable. No touch screen but keyboard makes it easy to use,0
the overall tone is too blue in my opinion and I was unable to correct for it to my taste.,0
"(Costly must atleast had a touchscree or a dideciated graphic card): It is costly , If it also included a touch screen then it might be worth it's price , as their is no dedicated graphic card or anything extra feature, just the enhancement of processor with the same specs.",0
I got it with a corrupted driver,0
The larger touch pad is a nice addition and allows easier movement across the screen without having to lift your finger and start again.,0
(Good laptop that gets the job done for work or ...): Good laptop that gets the job done for work or school. Battery life could be better. Will only last you around 4 hours even if you have the screen dimmed to 50% and performance set to medium. Lid also seems to scratch easily.,0
"(Not actually touchscreen): I bought this for my mom last Christmas. I recently asked her how she liked it, turns out it does not have a touchscreen",0
"(Bought it January of 2020 ....): My worst computer choice since I started buying computers. There's been a never-ending series of problems, but here's a big one that forced me to buy another laptop. Power comes in through the USB-C ports (more on the ""C"" USB's later). The computer needed to be powered up, but the USB-C ports weren't working. I tried a half-dozen on-line solutions first, like reinstalling the USB drivers, etc. I believe a windows update disabled them, (and not just the USB 3.0's), because the problem happened after an update. (You can Google this problem...it's for real.) Either way, with no power left, I couldn't roll back the update, or keep problem solving. So no power, and no way to charge it.If I hadn't been fixing problem after problem with this laptop, I could research more and try to solve this new problem, but I've had enough. Consider: the camera is at the bottom of the screen. So if you're on zoom, you can't type without filling up people's screens with your knuckles and fingers typing away. Everyone on the other end had complaints or jokes about this. Ridiculous.Other problems: the fan revved up suddenly (overheating) and the laptop shut down. It's so fast you can't hit ""save"" on your work. Whatever you're working on is lost, or you're disconnected from a zoom meeting. Yes, I updated the BIOS and all the rest, and it seemed to help for a while but never stopped reoccurring. I reinstalled windows. On and on. I won't list all the other glitches, but once the problems started, I never had 2 days in a row that I was able to use the laptop without reinstalling drivers, updating from Dell, and so on. I've owned 2 Dell desktops that were great. One is 7 years old and still running. This is my first dell laptop, and it's my last.Last detail: if you need a regular USB port, my model didn't have one. Say goodbye to all your thumb drives, printer cables, unless you like cluttering up your desk with a hub, and want to drag a hub around with you in case you're at another location and you need to hook up to their equipment. And another tip: many hubs you can buy on-line won't work because they need more power than the USB-C will give them. Good luck picking the right one on the first try. Also, I went through 3 hubs and windows never recognized one of them, but ""luckily"" it worked most to the time anyway.",0
"(Thumbs up): Daughter bought it with her Christmas money, she uses it for everything. Good quality",0
"(Thank you, Samsung!): I have had this Chromebook for 7 years - and it has never had a single problem! It still has the same battery from 2016!

"Lightning fast, with 32GB RAM for the most demanding apps",0
"(A solid machine for a software developer): I don’t game but I am a programmer whenever I need to get a new machine for my work I go for gaming laptops. Why? Firstly power, most gaming laptops are equipped with pretty powerful hardware. Compiling code (rust) on this machine is a quite pleasant experience with the powerful 8-core AMD 4800H and plentiful of RAM. Since I don’t do games I don’t notice any of the heating issues some users reported. Secondly I found matte display are better for my eyes. Interestingly most gaming laptops are matte-display. Also I should point out the display on this laptop is awesome. I also own a Acer Helios 300 (2018 version) and I found the colors on the Legion 5 are richer than the Helios. Thirdly the ports selection. This laptop comes with USB ports (A&C), an Ethernet port, a hdmi port.I’ve been running this laptop 24/7 since 3/13/2021 and found 0 issues so far. Machine is quiet most of the time. Sound on this laptop seems to be lounger than the Helios 300.However it would be nice if a fingerprint scanner and a microSD reader can be added to this laptop, that’s why I remove one star from the overall rating. Nevertheless it’s still a pretty decent machine esp. for its price point.",0

"(Nearly 0 processing power.

Unfortunately with the pandemic, most of my classes this semester are online and require the program Zoom to attend the classes. This chromebook HATES to run Zoom. I have had nothing but issue after issue with using video conferencing software. My microphone through Zoom works about 30% of the time and I constantly get an error that states something along the line of there is too many processes running in the background, even though nothing is running except Zoom. I also constantly get a ""your internet connection is unstable"" which is definitely is not. I have several, several devices in my home that run both directly wired and wireless through Wifi and none of them have never had this issue.

I've had it for a few weeks, and have been using Office on it mainly, but also Photoshop/Illustrator/Indesign. I tried streaming video to a Roku and it works well for that as well. I haven't experienced the problems that others have reported with the trackpad or fingerprint reader - both are working fine for me. Battery life has been adequate, but I'm not using it as a primary work computer. The fan can get noisy when doing processor-intensive tasks, but for web browsing or lighter tasks it is mostly silent.",0
(Letters and numbers on keyboard are difficult to read): My only complaint with this 15.6 inch HP laptop is that the letters and numbers on the keyboard are very difficult to read. I had to buy a keyboard cover with black letters and numbers so I could read the keys.,0
"(Defective And Contiues to go to Blue Screen): No longer works effectively. Games fail in under 15 minutes, crash and go to blue screen.There is nothing on the computer other than games.",0
(nice chromebook): good,0
"(Screen resolution is very poor & fuzzy): I was extremely disappointed and surprised to see and realize that the screen resolution is only 1366x768 and not 1920x1080 like my much older version of the same model CB5. You can see pixels and jagged edges, which makes even reading text very annoying.This laptop is totally unusable for serious work or any type of gaming. For just about the same price or $20 more you can get a crisp quality screen. I wish I'd checked every line of the specifications much more closely before purchasing this laptop.",0
I needed something a bit more powerful though,0
"it contained norton, and norton is a pain to delete and get rid off",0
"(What Chip Shortage): Good laptops are hard to get a hold of, and this one was no different. Found it here and jumped on it for my son who is going into the ECE program and needed this level of performance.Good quality so far. Runs hot. A little on the heavy side but bearable. I worry the heat will eventually kill it before his college abuse does.",0
(excellent laptop): Small and neat and works great,0
"(INCREDIBLY POWERFUL LAPTOP/TABLET COMBO AT THE TOP OF ITS CLASS): This is an awesome machine at this price point, and you get TWO-IN-ONE... it's a laptop, and also folds back to be a touch-screen tablet.PROS*If you're familiar with computers and Windows 10, then setup will be a breeze for you. Even if you're a newbie, there's not much you have to do for setup. This first time you turn it on, you'll be asked a series of questions (you can use voice prompts, or turn off the voice and just watch text on the screen). Just answer a few questions, and the setup routine literally does the rest. It seemed to take only 15-20 minutes for it to run through the entire setup-routine.*8-hour battery time with a quick-charge feature.*Case can be completely folded back to use in tablet mode, or can be positioned in a ""V"" shape so you can use the keyboard portion as the base while looking at the screen titled back to a suitable angle. The keys are recessed so they don't touch the surface when using it as a tablet in ""bent"" mode.*Keyboard has a great tactile feel, keys are super easy to depress and are great for fast typists.*Screen is bright, and responds excellently when used in touch-screen mode.*Design is sleek, stylish, and THIN!*3 USB ports (two of them are standard, one is USB C), SD card reader, HDMI out-put port so you can attach the unit to a larger screen if desired,*Built-in microphone, headphone jack, and a 720p webcam*8th Gen Intel Core i5 processor provides the fastest speed I've seen on a laptop or tablet.*Dual versatility of laptop and tablet is the ultimate in productivity.*Built-in WiFi*Harmon Speakers and Dobly Digital Audio makes this a powerhouse entertainment system for movie watching and gaming.CONS*Power cord is too short, but not a deal-breaker.Overall, this is an elegant workhorse of a machine that can handle any task you throw at it and have plenty of power to spare. The lightweight aluminum-brushed case is really a pleasure to hold and carry.I've long been a Lenovo fan, and this laptop/tablet combo continues to solidify that feeling. If you're looking for a powerful laptop, and also have use for a top-shelf tablet, I would highly recommend the Lenovo Flex, especially at this price point.",0
The display is bright enough,0
if you're looking for a high standard of quality and portability then this laptop is the way to go!,0
"(Horrible screen quality): Very poor viewing angles, warm inaccurate display. Much worse than what I've come to expect from Asus.",0
(Sistema operativo): No me gusto lo grande que es la máquina. De ahí todo muy bien. Buen sistema,0
The HP OMEN is a very well designed and fast gaming laptop,0
"(Great laptop!): Love the larger screen size, and this laptop is fast! So much faster than my old one. It was essentially ready to use out of the box. Very happy with it!",0
(Product was Defective): This product arrived without the ability to function. The screen was fine. The processor and ability to click were dysfunctional. I had to end up getting a new computer entirely.,0
It came to me with 1 stuck pixel that over the past couple days has turned into 4.,0
(not new but used): was to be a new acer but it was a used on that some had set it on warrenty with acer in june 2019 going to give it my grand daughter but would like some type of credit on my account for it,0
"(Perfect Machine): I don't normally write reviews, but I just wanted to report that this machine came in absolutely perfect. No touchpad issues, nothing negative whatsoever. I am highly critical of laptops, being a cloud architect. I can detect absolutely nothing wrong with this piece. I was highly concerned that the touchpad would wobble etc but nope, perfect. It's the first touchpad I've ever used that rivals a MacBook. It's actually big enough to perform the three and four-finger gestures that are now built in to windows 10. Touchscreen is sublime. Keyboard: no complaints. It's just great all around.",0
(Productivity beast - Ryzen 7 + decent GPU): Very happy that I picked this up on sale So far everything's good.By 2021 we will see Ryzens with stronger GPUs --those would be great gaming machines.Pick this older legion 5 on sale if you need productivity with a decent GPU or light / retro gaming.,0
"(Great so far. Battery life two hours): Only had it for a day. Haven't done much but set up and install some apps. I will be using this to make videos. And the program seems to run great. I have been using this for about 2 weeks. I have a driver issue and I tried everything to fix but it still isn't fixed. It doesn't seem to be a hinder. After having it for a few weeks, I noticed I have a low battery life. Not a bid deal since I only use it at home, but could be if used somewhere with no plug in available.",0
(Great. Value for money): Finally got my MacBook Air. So far so good. Value for money. I have used windows all my life. My first MacBook. Will share an update.,0
"(Best possible Bang for the buck gaming laptop): The laptop is really well-built, fast and simple perfect for work, study and gaming, the only thing to have in mind if that you are heavily gaming it can get hot, so I would recommend a cooling base/stand, but this is a great laptop for the price !",0
"(Good for everyday use): The sound/volume for some of the things I like to watch is a little too low even when volume is at maxed level. Other than that, it's a pretty good chromebook. It does what I need it for and I love how light it is as I roam around the house with it from time to time.",0
"(Awesome Laptop!!! Couldn't ask for more): This is a thorough review of the New Razor Blade 15 ultra light and thin laptop. Please note that I upgraded my rig to 32 GB RAM and 1TB SSD. 144hz refresh rate with GTX-1070 MaxQ version.What I use this laptop for:1.) Gaming; I game quite often and I play games like COD, Fortnite(Of Course), Rocket League, Counter Strike, etc...To no surprise this laptop is a beast. The graphics of my games and the frame rates are very good. This is coming from an Xbox gamer majority of their life so granted the difference is huge but in my opinion it is very satisfying. I have no issues with lag, screen tearing, and anything else you might encounter.2.) I use this laptop for heavy graphic editing and modeling for work. For work I run applications such as AutoCad, AutoCad Inventor, other Pattern Design Software, Adobe Creative Cloud(Photoshop, Illustrator, PremeirePro, etc.), and other work such as coding and designing websites. In sum, I use and rely on this laptop to get the job done swift and efficiently and it does just that. Whenever I download, update, or open applications my Blade gets to work right away and I don't have too much waiting time like other computers I used before for work. Windows 10 upgraded from Home to Pro in about 5 mins.3.) Music, internet surfing, netflix, etc... This laptop handles these tasks with ease, kinda like everybody else not thinking twice about breathing :pOverall, this laptop looks beautiful, sleek, thin, and it is light. This laptop definitely turns heads. And oh I forgot to mention the chroma lighting function is super sick. I don't have much to complain about this laptop for it does everything and more than I expected it to do.Now lemme be real with all you potential buyers;- You are buying a name brand product get over the price, definitely worth it.- No ethernet port. If you are anal about having to connect a USB to ethernet converter look elsewhere, but you are missing out.- This laptop is very powerful, but also very thin. UNDERSTAND!!! That this laptop will get hot when you game with high graphics or when you try to push this laptop. This isn't an issue with this laptop it is with every ultra light and thin laptop. But note, CPUs and GPUs these days can, surprisingly, take some pretty high temperatures without being damaged, so if you are going to be pushing this laptop download a program that can keep you updated with temperatures.- Lastly, understand Razor makes tons and tons of products it isn't much of a surprise that some products come faulty. If this happens to you talk to support, if you bought through amazon exchange your product and get a new one.- People are always gonna find ways to leave negative feedback about products like this, understand no laptop is ""perfect"", there are only laptops that fit an individuals specific needs.Conclusion:Im sad to see such bad reviews on Amazon, but if you want this laptop go look at multiple youtube reviews and other gaming laptop comparisons. This is the first time I purchased a Razor product and man am I more than happy. From now I will always consider a Razor product. No laptop is ""perfect"", find one that fits your individual needs, and good luck searching for laptops. I know I found my brand and I feel comfortable enough to say this laptop will last several years minimum, which if you ask me isn't such a bad investment(:",0
(The mouse didn't last month for me): I received this laptop April 22 2021… its now May 17 2021 and the mouse has quit working. I don't want to even bother with the return because it'll take over a month just to get a replacement… if u buy this u better buy a wireless or usb mouse!!,0
after ~3 days of use the coil whine just got worse and worse.,0
(Beast of a Machine): This is a solid gaming laptop. It runs my games at maximum settings with 240 FPS and no latency. Amazing! Better than any desktop I've ever had.,0
"(Like many others say, screen quality is inexcusable): This is something you'll notice the second you open up your laptop, it looks just like the ones we had to use in school! the crappy $50 DoE laptops and yet this is a $400 laptop. It is inexcusable and the glare is so bad that any other benefits of this laptop are thrown out the window.There is a reason why they don't talk about their display technology for this model in depth. That's because its just not IPS. If you're looking for a laptop you have to make sure they have IPS displays, its 2020 there should be no other option!",0
"(Laptop batch defective - won't charge): I have ordered 2 of these laptops and both have the same problem -- they don't charge. The charging light (amber) goes on for 1 second and then turns off. What a shame. After resetting the battery via the power button as suggested in the Acer forum, the problem persists. Apparently this a known issue with the Acer 515-56 models. I am surprised Acer is allowed to sell a defective model like this. Save yourself the trouble of having to send it back and wait 2 weeks for a refund from Amazon",0
(Four Stars): nice computer for a teen,0
"(Great): Great specs, works really great and really light to carry around.",0
"(Good value, bad display): At this price point, you can't really get everything you want in a laptop. This is a pretty big upgrade from the personal laptop I had been using for years.. An old, refurbished, hunk of junk. I don't do any gaming or any graphics editing on this. I mostly do just web browsing, basic video watching, some light word processing, etc. I use it daily, but it is not my main computer.For what I use it for, it is snappy, has good battery life, is light, and just generally works well so far. I like the the keyboard size and don't have any problems typing on it which I've had with other laptops. I like the small 10-key.The big negative for this device, like others have described, is the display, It may be one of the worst displays I've come across. The range of view is really bad.. It always seems like the backlight needs to be turned down.. It is not really pleasant to look at.. At all. No touchscreen is a bit of a negative, but for the price, it is what it is.If this was going to be my main computer/display, I would spend a bit more for something better or just not use it as a laptop and hook it up to an external display.Overall, I like this device as brand new.. The display issue is minor to me personally, and it works well for what I use it for.",0
(Not a easy to use or set up computer): Heard Mac was different but how is unreal nothing your use to doing is easy to find on this system. Be sure you can operate it I could not sent it back for normal laptop.,0
(Worth the Money): I am a grad student and casual gamer. When I get to play its for like 4 hours a couple times a week. This computer doesn't overheat or start glitching out. Tested it on vacation with a nearly 10 hour gaming session and the charge cord battery barely got warm. Super worth the money. This computer came with great features I didn't know I needed until grad school assignments surprised me. Very impressed. Would highly recommend this computer.,0
"(Great for the price and is upgradeable): I bought this laptop for gaming and to handle editing/drafting software. Its light-weight, has great construction, and feels good to type with. I am used to mecha-membrane keyboards and I was worried the transition to a laptop keyboard would feel funny. But this feels natural enough for me not to think about it or worry about it. I love the fact that I can buy this laptop in this day and age with the option to upgrade it if i wanted to. Love this laptop.",0
"(Turned out to be a great purchase!): My daughter uses this all the time, daily. Loves this. Works great for playing Roblox & for all of her needs. Absolutely a great buy!",0
"(Great for the price, can't go wrong): Headline says all",0
"they delayed my shipping two times despite me trying reschedule it and paying for 1 day shipping, although it did come one earlier then the changed date.",0
"(Good but poor batter): In terms of performance this laptop is great. However, the battery life is so poor that it defeats the purpose of having a laptop !It takes a while to charge but then from just using chrome and microsoft word I'm lucky to get 2 hours out of a full charge. For this reason I give it 3 stars. I get that grunty laptops require a lot of power but surely there's merit in giving it a better battery?The kicker is that the ""battery saver"" mode actually drains the battery quicker when on that it does when it's off !!!?I purchase laptops as I quite often have to travel for my business so for this reason I will not be purchasing a Lenovo again. I would be better off just carrying around my desktop with me.",0
(Great laptop): It works perfect and easy to set up. I had a smaller one and Google loaded all I needed on my new one,0
"(Battery doesn't work): I am from Ecuador, and I recieived a bad product. The battery doesn't work, it just doesn't charge. I contact with Amazon and they told me I can return the laptop, but I have to pay for the cost of returning it. It costs me 200 dollars and Amazon will not cover this. My advice, if you don't live in USA don't buy it.",0
"(Excelente equipo, dise?o y hardware excelente.): Llego un día antes, el equipo me gustó du dise?o sobrio, es muy portatil y su hardware es bueno por el precio.",0
two important keys are not working,0
"(Child's device! The keyboard is awful.): If you plan on using this Googlebook to type anything, you might want to reconsider and purchase another brand. The keyboard is set up showing all lower case letters and is very different than a normal keyboard. Very much of a children's device with the lack of functions and storage! We wish we would have purchased a real laptop computer for the same price!",0
"(Waited to test it out before review): So I’ve had this just about 3 weeks , I love it!!! Do yourself a favor get the 1050ti it really boosts this laptop. The ssd makes this thing boot up really fast and smooth, the i7 is new to me I use amd I’m very impressed with it. Gaming on this thing is nice I haven’t found anything that won’t run ultra I’m sure there is some but not many. I also just got into video editing and this really does a great job at it. The turbo boost fan keeps this running cold. Overall I’m in love with this laptop it’s lightweight battery if not gaming goes about 4 hours a little less gaming maybe a 1 hour time.",0
(very pleased): i love it and it’s perfect for school and it comes with so many amazing features,0
"(graphics suck.): I have owned a lot of acer and,asus in the past and,they were awesome but,this asus i,m not impressed with at all.It took some time to set up was not all that user friendly at all.my biggest let down is the graphics.I downloaded several pictures from the microsoft page for wallpapers and,they are not real clear at all.i,m dissapointed in this unit.I will continue to use it and,work with it but,I would not recommend it or ever buy it again.",0
"(Blue Screen often): I bought my Razerblade directly from the company last November (2017) and was excited to finally have a premium laptop. I'm a developer by trade and this is my primary work computer. Not long after I got it, I started getting random blue screens. I contacted Razer and they had me do a factory reset. This didn't change anything and I still had BSOD issues.They had me send my laptop in for repair and after a little more than a week I got a new laptop in the mail. This one had the same issues. Went through the process again and ended up with a third laptop. This one finally seemed to work.... for about 4 months. Then it just up and died. Sent that one in and they replaced the motherboard and sent it back to me. I'm not sure if they are just recycling components but this one has all of the same BSOD issues the previous ones did.Would not buy this laptop.",0
"(You kinda get what you pay for.): Super. cheap. value. Small size, very light.I use it as a glorified tablet when I play D&D and to use notepad.Locks up occationally, and the trackpad is terrrrrrible. Often freezes on you while the rest of the computer works.",0
"(Great gaming laptop for casual gamers): My background: I'm a college student, so I use it for schoolwork and games sometimes. I never had a gaming laptop before.I've had it for a month now; I got it for $200 off, which is a great deal, though I would not recommend buying it for full price; from what I read, there are better laptops for the price range. It has a lot of useful features, like the cooling boost and shift. I'm not a fan of the default colors on the monitor; it looks too white, but I turned up the contrast so it looks better. The audio on the laptop isn't too good either, but I usually use headphones so it evens out. The speakers are also closest towards you on the bottom, though the laptop slants down anyways so the design seems pointless.As for gaming, I mostly use it to play League of Legends, which I can run at max settings and have it perform perfectly, which is great! Fortnite is the other demanding game I play, which runs at 75% max settings; still works and looks great. Everything else is on Steam and isn't that demanding, like Age of Empires 2.The laptop feels pretty sturdy for transportation, which is good when I take it to the library to study. The touchpad is slightly to the left, so sometimes my left hand will drag the cursor down the screen a bit or jump to a different part of a paragraph, which can be annoying while writing a paper. It has a fast startup time. The screen itself reduces glares a lot and makes it easy to see in bright areas; I've never had to turn the brightness above 30%Overall I'm satisfied with it.",0
"(Garbage): Garbage, bought it in March and crapped out in October. Left. Mouse doesn’t work anymore and the sound went out, literally hasn’t left my desk. Last asus product I buy",0
(Small): Wasn’t the size I expected,0
"(This chromebook was great for a couple of days): This chromebook was great for a couple of days, but then it would wouldn't stay connected to the internet. I tried multiple networks. Nothing worked. I did some research and apparently this is a common problem. Finally returned the product.",0
"(Great laptop for my use): I'm not sure about the gaming aspect of this lap top and personally, I don't care. I bought this lap top for the purpose of running programs like Solid Works or Fusion 360 for drawing and designing parts for machining purposes. This lap top does exactly that. This lap top is exceptionally fast and does exactly what I need it to do. I do not game at all. My only complaint is the batter life. The battery life sucks ass. Within about 2 hours the battery is at 40-50%. For me that's not that big of a deal as I always have my power supply with me. I just feel this battery life should be a lot more efficient than what it is. Otherwise, I love this lap top for what I use it for. Memory is great and the processor speed is exceptional.",0
(Did not come with a 1920x1080 screen!!!!! And came with the wrong laptop charger.): Did not come with a 1920x1080 screen!!!!! And came with the wrong laptop charger.The resolution was the WHOLE reason i bought it!,0
"(Everything works perfectly with Linux): This hardware is highly compatible with Linux. I am using Arch on this, and everything works out of the box --- no special drivers were needed.It seems to be reasonably fast, and the only downside for me is the screen brightness. While I think it is sharp enough, it is less bright than I care for. (However, others that used this screen find it more to their taste in terms of brightness, so this is very much a matter of opinion rather than fact.)The real pleasure here of course the price; a 15.6 screen, 128 gigabyte SSD, an I3 processor, and 8 gigabytes of memory are quite good specs for a $400 machine.",0
(Great laptop): I received this product and immediately downloaded some triple a games it ran them with no issues like most gaming laptops it has to be plugged in to accommodate the power required but it's an amazing laptop,0
(Solid value): Very good pc for the price. Easy to use. Fast.,0
(Is this laptop good for Diablo live?): Is this computer good for Diablo live?,0
(Nice laptop): 1 Week with it and no problem yet.,0
"(Great investment): Great value!As amazing as described! Really powerful!Not too heavy, nice lighting and performance!No cons so far.",0
"(En verdad es una Air!!!): La compré para actualizar mi iMac de casi 10 a?os que ya anda algo lenta. La nueva iMac no me agrada su dise?o, así que también por presupuesto adquirí esta MacBook Air M1 a muy buen precio, es muy ligera lo cual hace que pueda transportarla fácilmente. Es realmente rápida comparada con mi antigua Mac y con la compu del trabajo.El principal uso que le doy es ofimática, algo de dise?o de fotos y videos, navegar en internet, Spotify, YouTube, correos, Netflix y así.Cuando la configuré al inicio, se calentó bastante sin aparentemente estar haciendo nada y me preocupé pero leí que es normal al configurar la laptop por primera vez, después que ya quedó lista, ocupó de varias horas eso sí, no ha vuelto a molestar con altas temperaturas.Ahora bien, no es que le he dado un uso intensivo así que no podría decir si en realidad se calienta mucho al llevarla a un uso extremo. Como aun no es mi computadora principal, no la uso mucho a diario, por lo que me ha durado la batería, después de cargarla al 100 %, casi una semana llegando al 15 % al quinto día sin apagarla de un día para el otro, solo la cierro y la uso al día siguiente; hago esto porque he leído que así funciona mejor Mac OS.En unos meses pienso realizar una actualización de esta opinión de usuario.Ahhhhh!!!, de ley consigan un USB-C hub, yo compré uno con 3 USB-A y una entrada para ethernet.",0
(I can't help but be loyal to Apple): The best laptop I've used in years. You won't regret it.,0
(Great Laptop): This one has one the highest performing 3060 in the market right now.Performs on par with most 3070 laptops due to it being 115w vs some 90w 3070's out there.Arous Control Center is a mess and the AI features are annoying as hell.It detects Visual Studio as a high performance tasks and revs the fans up 200% ridiculous.Everytime you launch a game it goes into gaming mode and shifts your keyboard to rainbow puke.Give yourself some time to set it up correctly or disable it entirely.After some tweaking i was able to set control center to my liking.Battery life is great considering its a high performance machine.,0
"(Slow, but probably good for movie-watching): We needed a cheap laptop to do Gmail and Google Docs only. We bought this in September 2019. The screen is large and bright, and the sound is outstanding, but there is a painful delay when interacting with Gmail and Google Docs, even if only one tab is open in Chrome. Compared to the Windows 7 laptop we bought for about $300 back in 2011, it boots quickly of course, but is noticeably slower once you are in Gmail. Some browser tweaking didn't make any noticeable improvement.",0
"(Pretty Impressed): For less than $200, I am quite pleased with this laptop. I'm not sure why there is a rating for 'touch-screen' as the screen is a normal one. I'm kind of bummed out that I can't play Old-School Runescape on it normally, but I'm sure I'll get over it (I have the iPhone app). This OS runs smooth and fast for me and it's a nice & simple laptop for my upcoming semester. Battery charges fairly quickly and is truly long-lasting. I'll update this the more I use it.",0
"(Great gaming laptop for the price range!): Almost two weeks in with my new Lenovo Legion 5 gaming laptop and so far I'm quite happy with it. Only problems for me were some old outdated cables which caused connection issues that I needed to upgrade to with additional purchases on Amazon. Keep in mind folks, all the USB-A ports on this thing are 3.2 Gen1. You may or may not have problems trying to use older 2.0 cables. This laptop replaces an MSI gaming laptop that was a few years old and was beginning to have problems so I looked around Amazon and found this little affordable gem. Very happy that I purchased it. I like the 512gb SSD drive, very fast to launch programs including Adobe Creative Cloud apps. I'll add an additional 1tb SSD drive in the available slot in the near future but for now everything is humming along nicely. I added two external 27"" monitors, one via the HDMI port and the other with one of the USB-C ports. Both USB-C ports are Alt-Mode supported and are capable of transmitting video signals so you can add additional monitors via these two ports. I don't know if either USB-C ports are capable of using docks though. I'll contact Lenovo customer service to find out. For gaming I only have time to play a few AAA games, Star Wars Battlefront I & II (EA), BioShock games and the Age of Empires games (not the new AOE IV though, I uninstalled it after playing a few hours, I find the graphics terribly disappointing, awful for 2021-22). So all in all, very happy with my new Lenovo Legion 5 AMD Ryzen 7, 15"" gaming laptop.",0
(screen problems second time in one year): purchased warrenty but make me jump through hoops and hoops no results yet,0
the windows update function was set to be off for some reason,0
Not comfortable when playing at night,0
"(First Impressions Win): MSI came highly regarded by many of my colleagues. So far I am not disappointed.The body feels sturdy, and the screen is beautiful. The keys are a little soft, but sure I will get used to it. The RGB keyboard is a nice touch.",0
It's so cool to have a moveable workstation,0
"(acer nitro 5 gaming laptop): not the best nor is it the worst gaming laptop out there. The display is very dark compared to even a cheap gaming monitor. It only has 1 stick of ram so it runs in single channel, majorly impacting its overall performance. It does have a small m.2 boot drive which really helps improve its overall responsiveness. For non gaming enthusiasts I would definitely recommend as a starter gaming laptop.",0
(Value for Money.): Value for money. Good for Email and simple task.,0
(Flawless): Perfect business laptop. Flawless. No sense to own anything heavier,0
(Four Stars): I like this product. It runs debian with only a few hitches.,0
(Excellent product): Works amazing,0
"(Customer service is poor, poor.): Computer crash in 1 month,for all that money it sucks.",0
"(Fits my needs nicely.): Perfect for what I need, except for the poor webcam, so only 4 stars.The screen is very nice, excellent colors and bright.This computer arrived in perfect condition, and setup was simple, and without any problems. Wifi works beautifully, and very fast.I really like the simplicity of Windows 11, and think it's the best OS yet.The only issue I have is the webcam quality, very grainy video and pictures, but I'll just but an external webcam to use for Zoom meetings and other things.The price is perfect for my budget, and think this laptop is a very good value for what it is.",0
"(Not for gaming but aight I guess): Definitely a decent computer. Sucks for games. If you have steam or origin, don't bother because they dont run on chromebooks",0
"(Fine chrome book): For a slow web browser it works fine, I enjoy it use, me and my son playing d&d with zoom app, video communication is good, it nice it auto updates and I keep it running to watch YouTube or write with google online , I enjoy the product",0
when I close the screen it doesnt sit flush on the chassis.,0
(Stopped working after three weeks): Stopped working after 3 weeks,0
(Comes with windows 11 and Intel i5): Average price more computer than needed for the person I gifted it to,0
"(Super Value): I carefully and thoroughly researched gaming computers for three weeks. I screened every major brand looking for a unit having a very large screen, high ram, very high storage, an incredibly strong video card, and a multi-core very fast processor.I I wanted every component to have the most recognized name brand. Last it had to be under $1500 in cost. Sager had the only unit that met every single requirement. I have just received and unboxed it and was especially impressed with the packaging. I will post a performance review after I see what it cab do.Performance review:Light speed fast. Never crashes; runs cool. Rated to play some 9000 games. Love it!",0
"(I do recommend the productt): This is my first gaming laptop and I bought it to use it accordingly, also for work and college. I’ve being using it for a month now and I am very happy with my purchase. I very happy whit the quality of the product and its components. It is fast and can play games fluently.I haven’t seen any issues with temperatures or any malfunction of any kind so far.The only issues I have notice is the battery life, it is poor but, I was aware of that before I bought it, and it has some backlight bleed, but it does not bother me at all I believe it is pretty normal for a IPS display at least in my unit.I do recommend the product; it has good quality for the price and for now and the use I’ve giving it I am more than satisfice.",0
"(fast, quiet and powerful): This laptop is fast and powerful. The fan is also very quite and the surface where your hands sit while typing doesn't heat up. The screen is nice and I also like the red backlit keyboard and number pad. The bulky connections are on the back, so it doesn't interfere with having a separate mouse on the side. Its a bit heavy, but with all the features it's worth the extra weight. So far so good!",0
"(Great Pc): My wife loves her new computer no complaints and trust me when it comes to computers it is not easy to keep her happy, but wow this computer she keeps bragging about, so husbands this pc will keep your wife happy since sims does not buffer.",0
"(Review from gamers: A+!): The short version is that this is by FAR the best laptop I have ever owned.But to give some context: I am a middle aged working mom who primarily wants a good laptop because I am impatient with lag and because I take a billion pictures. BUT, I do play World of Warcraft once or twice a week so whatever laptop I use needs to be gaming quality. My oldest son just (last week!) graduated from Full Sail University with his BS in Game Design so he is obviously a very heavy gamer. He's home right now for the holidays and I had him give this beauty a good test drive overnight, trying it on WoW and on some Steam games he plays. Both of us LOVE it and my son proclaims it better than his Full Sail laptop.I LOVE:+ GREAT graphics. I can have WoW set to the max graphics and it looks amazing.+ SUPER fast processing - everything, every game, every site, everything loads in a blink. WOW what a pleasure.+ I love the keys. They are slightly elevated and have, I don't know how to say it, good differentiation between them. What this means for me is far fewer typos as my fingers seem to find the right keys unerringly. Also the keyboard can be set to be backlit, which I like.+ Great storage. 1 TB which is enough for all my pictures!+ 3 USB ports, also an HDMI port+ The power cord is in the back which I think is brilliant! I hate side mounted power outlets because what if it doesn't fit your set up (what if your power cord is on the left and where you sit the wall outlet is on your right)-- then you have to drape the cord around you and it's irritating.+ Slim, light (5 pounds!), and quietGAMER SON LOVES:- Easily handles 60 FPS at maxed our graphics- Runs several programs jointly with no slow down or fan use- 1 TB of available storage perfect for storing games- Sound speakers can play extremely loud- Multiple USB ports for gaming BOTTOM LINE: Powerful, beautiful, lightning quick, and a TB of storage. LOVE LOVE LOVE!Note: The specs are well documented on the product page which is why I don't list them in detail but in short: Intel Core i7 8th gen processor, 15.6"" screen, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics, RAM 16 GB DDR4, 1000 GB Hybrid Drive",0

"(DOA Faulty Hardware, no power): I really like chromebook, but these so-called ""refurbished"" units need to be pulled from the shelf & thrown in the trash. I sent back the first one I received and had a replacement sent to me. Both of them had the same problem.... powers on long enough to go through the setup, then it just shuts down. No power, no lights, nada, nothing. I spent an hour on the phone with Amazon and Dell support who finally said it was ""bad hardware"" so they sent me another one. And....you guessed it, the 2nd one did the exact same thing. Another person I know said he's tried 3 of them and they all had the exact same problem. So, why is Amazon letting this junk continue to be sold just to have frustrated customers and product returns???",0
"(Buena): Pedí una computadora que ya no estaba en existencia, pero el vendedor fué muy amable al contactarme y ofrecerme otras opciones.Es una PC de segundo uso, trae todos los programas básicos instalados y de entretenimiento, el cargador no funcionó y solicite otro el cual me llegó rápido. Buena atención a pesar de todo",0
It is well built and really a great laptop for the price,0
"(Bad microphone): The microphone does not work at all on our laptop. No one can hear me speaking in zoom or any other online meeting platform.

(This was a STEAL!): Great little computer. Works awesome for what I need it for. Charges well. Battery lasts for quite awhile. Super simple and easy to set up.,0
"(Battery wouldnt charge.): So far I've gotten it out of box, plugged it, and booted it up. Super easy and I just left it alone to update. Tried starting it up this morning and the battery never charged. After 30+ minutes with both HP and Amazon they are sending me a replacement. Once I receive the replacement I will update.",0
(Not worth the money): Very unhappy with this computer. The keyboard doesn’t work properly. The keys are completely mixed up and there is actually no hashtag button. We are going to return it.,0
"(Hearty Laptop for Non-gamers Too): Sitting at a table in Busse Woods near Chicago, sipping a joe, watching people walk by, I typed a thing or two I'd forget in a week.""Do you want to play a game?"" she asked.

No problems.""""You do all that at once?""""No, but I tried it. Every app I'd use, I ran all together, just to see,"" I explained.The afternoon never got around to gaming, but my laptop never lost power. The battery surprised me.I don't carry it often.

"(Chorme OS is missing or damaged - Buyer beware!): I bought this Chromebook for my daughter February 2016, it's November 2016 and it stopped working. Message says ""Chrome OS is missing or damaged"" went thru all of the recovery steps numerous times and it still does not work. We are just stuck having to purchase another laptop. Very disappointed in this laptop and it durability. Apparently this is a very common problem with Chromebooks so be careful when purchasing and just wanted to make any buyers aware as I would not have purchased this had I known this was a common problem with the Chromebook all models.",0
"(Great value): My wife needed a fairly straightforward work laptop, and the zenbook is a great balance between features, price and weight.The only downside is that the laptop comes with lots of pre-installed crap that needs to be removed.

Easy to set up and using it with vMix was no problem. Seems plenty fast enough and the screen is quite bright. I'm driving an external monitor with its USB-C port quite easily. So far, we've encountered no problems.",0
"(Great product for the price): I recently started back to school to finish my degree and needed a laptop. Started researching my options, came across the Chromebook. I'm very impressed with this computer. The size is perfect, over all it's great. I plan on buying my kids one after they graduate high school and need a laptop for college. It would be useless if you did not have a Wifi connection, so that is an important factor to keep in mind. Very sharp looking and love that it is touch screen. Would highly recommend.",0
"(Gets overheated and causes problems): Great little laptop but it gets overheated easily and then starts to run into bugs when it does which is annoying when you are trying to make a presentation or when working on Adobe premiere. It can make the program stop working or you can lose your content all together. If they could figure out how to keep it cool enough, I'd say it is an awesome little laptop. Battery life is short when running programs but if just surfing the web, it'll last long. Screen quality is amazing though.",0

Yo no uso nada de dise?o, así que no puedo decir si sirve bien, pero creo que esta computadora al tener una GPU integrada, sera para algo básico. Mi recomendación es simple: quieres ir sobrado con tareas de la escuela y la oficina, éntrale; si la quieres para jugar o dise?o gráfico, hay mejores opciones. La pantalla no es la mejor, pero es muy amigable con la vista para quienes pasamos tiempo en ella y el teclado no tiene la letra ?, pero al configurar la computadora y el teclado en espa?ol de Mexico, aparece automáticamente en donde se supone que iban los;La RAM va a 3200 MHz, lo cual es una velocidad muy buena y se puede aumentar a los 32 GB, lo único malo es el espacio de almacenamiento que al final después de las actualizaciones solo quedaran 150 GB libres, nada que con un disco externo no se solucione.

"(This is a really cool and a bit of a beautiful mess): So let's just cut to the chase. I like innovative different and unique ideas. As such, I wasn't unrealistic about the capabilities and limitations of so much hardware packed into a tiny space. For the most part, this unit delivers. When plugged into it's mobile dock, it can handle any graphics task you throw at it.The device is compact, similar to a microsoft surface, but dramatically thicker, which is to be expected. I'm quite disappointed in the window on the rear of the device. Yea, it's cool, but completely unnecessary. I would not mind it being there, other than it is not level with the rest of the device causing it to be uneven when placed on its back. That's just odd.The device reeks quality. The implementation is quite good. The battery life is meh. I'm used to a full-day of battery use from my surface. This, even at optimized settings will get you 4-5 if you're careful. So that cuts down on the portability to an extent.As far as performance, it's a bit buggy. I expect Asus to correct these issues over time with upgrades, but I've just had alot of weird, atypical issues. For example, the bluetooth stopped working for several hours and several resets, only to inexplicably start working again. I've had the unit freeze up, expecting to require a hard-reset, only to have it resolve whatever was causing the freeze and to go back to performing normally.But the BIGGEST disappointment by far is the keyboard cover. It looks and feels like the microsoft surface covver, with the same external quality, but WOW is this thing a wreck. I'm a mechanical keyboard fan, as I use my keyboard constantly, so I carry a small mechanical with me. But for paying $3,000, you would expect this thing to work. The keyboard just stops working Then starts again. And when you finally decide it is DOA, it comes alive again. I have yet to get a full day of the keyboard not completely malfunctioning. It's odd because the LED keys light up, but the keys simply won't work. Going into the device manager, you can see that there is some kind of USB error, which I'm positive is the keyboard, as it disappears once the keyboard starts working.Now..a warning. I have YET to figure out how to get service from ASUS on this keyboard issue. They have eliminated (to my knowledge) all direct chats and phone numbers, opting instead for a utility that supposedly gives a system check and, if it fails, will direct you to a chat to get help. Unfortunately, the utility doesn't recognize the keyboard failure. On the utility, you can reach out to chat, but NOWHERE in their list of products can this device be found, so you cannot proceed to chat with a Asus rep without it.What a terrible oversight when providing a $3,000 tablet!!! I have a mind to return it, as I can't figure out how to get service for the keyboard, but honestly, I don't use it much anyway other than to be a screen-protector.I hope this review helps you make a decision.",0
(Don't buy if you want screen quality): Screen quality is bad.,0
(Great laptop value): Looks and operates as it shouls. Doesnt heat up in my lap. Light weight.,0

Having the ability to change fan speed is great because it can help save the computer from damage in the long run.,0
(Good as new. Great deal. Buy yours today.): Good as new. Clean and scratch-free. Great deal.,0
(Good value for performance): Great value to performance cost compared to other laptops. Has plenty of room to expand storage. Only dislike is the cover shows every fingerprint but you can live with that.,0

"(Chrome is Golden!): I like my new HP Chromebook 14-ak050nr quite a lot. Yes, it has all the limitations of chromebooks with respect to its own unique operating system, but those limitations are well known. What it does have is a beautiful display with a matt finish, an attractively-styled exterior appearance, good internals, pleasant-sounding speakers, an array of well-positioned ports, and a nice keyboard and trackpad. Taking into account what it offers compared to the competition and its price on Amazon, I think that it is an excellent choice for anyone in the market for a new chromebook. It is the first chromebook that I have ever owned, so I don't have another to compare it with, but I am pleased with my choice and enjoy using the machine. I have never yet called Tech Support at HP, so I can't be of much guidance there as to how helpful they may be in the future in the event of issues that may arise. I am hoping that they are there for us when we need them.",0
"(Slower than mud): I read a couple online review articles claiming this machine gives the biggest bang for the buck. Should have listened to the reviewers here who reported slow machines, but no, I chose to favor the positive reviews. When I plugged this thing in and finally got it going, I simply could not believe how it drags. It's slower than the mid-range Lenovo laptop I got in 2011. It's slower than the high-end Dell I got in 2003 (on which I replaced the hard drive and reinstalled W7 - but still, please, it was 2003!). OK, so I knew it would be loaded with junk. I removed what I knew was OK and spent two days researching whether it was OK to remove some of the propriety stuff Acer installed. It's still not much faster. I know how fast it SHOULD be because the very same day I received this one, a friend asked me to help her set up her new Asus laptop - same size, almost exactly the same other specs. Hers was lightning fast, as fast I would expect in a brand new laptop with plenty of power. This may be one of the worst $529 investments I've ever made. My time is worth more than the days I've spent haggling with this beast. If I were more techy, I would have followed the suggestions to reset to factory specs. But since the OS is already loaded with no backup disc, I was reluctant in case I somehow erased Windows 10.",0

"(I have only had this for a few days, ...): I have only had this for a few days, but wish I had kept the packaging, because I would return it. This works ok with my home wifi but has not been able to find wifi in other public places that my ipad can work with. Had I known the limitations I would have bought something else.",0
(She loved it): Gift for my wife and she ever happy with it,0
"(Complete garbage, avoid and buy elsewhere): You may think that this laptop is a good investment, but let me tell you it's not. It has come with numerous faults and imperfections both technical and physical. I am a CS student that uses a laptop everyday for school. The typing experience is the one thing I will not complain about. But otherwise here are the issues I have encountered while owning this piece of junk. I knew that the battery life would be very low but I am always near a power outlet with a charger so that was not a concern. I am extremely careful with my everyday items so the recurring issues are not justified at all. This laptop has been nothing but utter DISAPPOINTMENT1. Less than a year old, the keyboard starts to fail. The enter and the top row of number became unresponsive and required double clicking along with long pressing. This is especially irritating as I am always typing away. I did everything in my power to fix this issue thinking it was a software problem but NO, I had to get my keyboard fully replaced, which set me back $150 more...2. The screen: Given that this has a TN panel I understood what I was getting myself into. But let me tell you once you experience ips you will never want to go back. After a few weeks, this screen started developing white (light) spots that don't change regardless of what you do to the screen. Not to mention the screen has horrible color accuracy and viewing angles.3. The laptop enclosure: After about a year and a half, the bottom part of this laptop began to crack. In addition, the exhaust fins also began to break! Not once have I dropped this laptop. It turns out that this laptop is not built to last; but instead to satisfy the gaming aesthetic. The build quality of this thing feels like a heavy piece of cheap plastic crap.4. Failing audio jack: Hey if you're a big fan of listing to music while you work on your computer just know that after the first year, your audio jack will just say hey ""Maybe this job is not for me anymore"" because that's what it did to me. Like seriously, something that's universally available in modern day tech... GONE poof!5. Inconvenience: This hunk of garbage comes with a 1050ti, awesome. But if you wanted to strictly wanted to use intel's integrated graphics you really don't have that option no matter how much you configure this crap to USE INTEGRATED GRAPHICS. It always alternates and does whatever the heck it wants.- No matter how much tinkering you do, this laptop will NEVER make it past the 5hr mark. Believe me, you do not want to make the same mistake I did. Don't be naive and find some other reputable brand. Sure, this thing is best bang for buck spec wise but the tiny issues that accompany this thing defeats the whole purpose.",0

"(A cheap laptop that works well with Geforce Now): This laptop is a ""you get what you pay for"" kind of deal and running programs locally on the Chromebook is slow but running programs in the cloud is a whole different case. I tried gaming on this laptop with the help of Geforce Now, a cloud gaming platform, and it was awesome. If you have internet download speeds of at least 20MB or higher, you can run games like Fortnite or Apex Legends like you would on your Desktop.

Replaced it and the last 2 pics are what the replacement looked like after a few days as well. It would not happen every time, but it would have that white line around the edge for maybe 30 min and would fade back to normal. More recently, the replacement won't turn on immediately after hitting power button. The screen stays black and no response for 15 minutes or so. I wanted to give it one more chance, because I haven't read about this happening to anyone else and I received these two laptops right before Amazon went out of stock, so I thought maybe I just got bad ones at the end but, unfortunately, Amazon can only provide a refund and are still out of stock.",0
"(Overall a great laptop (still using after 4 years)): I really use this laptop for personal use and for casual gaming (POE, Paladins, ex-Overwatch) and it holds up well in the graphics sector but the video card is soldered to the CPU so it’s impossible to upgrade graphics. It’s sporting a intel UHD 620 and that’s in the low average range compared to other laptops with similar specs. It’s an overall GREAT laptop for the price. I actually recommend Asus over Dell or HP as I’ve had no issues internally with the device so far. It’s light and the metal material makes it very sturdy/durable. You can be active and use it with one hand.The laptop is a bit small so I recommend getting a desk so you won’t feel so cramped. The keyboard is small but not everyone has hulk fingers, I like how close the keys are and it’s backlit too.",0

(Apple Rocks!!): I love this laptop!,0
"(Rainbow Vomit): It's a lowish price 16gb 3080 laptop that still manages to stay cooler than some previous gaming laptops I've had. By far my biggest complaint is that, even when setting profiles in the RGB Fusion control center, the system ALWAYS resets back to the default high speed rainbow vomit keyboard backlight mode, and sometimes the Control Center program refuses to open until I reboot the system. Another minor gripe is that there's no standby mode or off mode(from what I can find) for the Intel HD Graphics, so even though you're primarily using the 3080, the system still reserves half of your RAM for the APU, so even though this system is advertised as having 32gb of RAM, in actuality it's 16gb for general use and 16gb for the APU graphics memory.With the above being said, it's an overall great machine for the money, but if you have some extra cash to throw at it, I'd recommend going over to NewEgg and searching 'hi-devolution'. They're a Build To Order vendor that will cost a couple hundred extra out of the gate, but you will get things like better thermal paste/pads in the machine for lower overall temps and you can order it with more ram and bigger SSDs.",0

"(all defective in some way): I bought 4 of these for various employees. One went back the first month with a failed hard drive. Another went back for multiple problems including a bad drive the next month. Couldn't run much of anything and took around 5 minutes to boot up. The other 2 have some odd traits but are doing generally OK for now, but after 50% of them failing within 2 months, I don't have high hopes for the 2 remaining ones. Obviously using trash components. $13,000 down the drain and Sager won't take them back. Do yourself a favor and wait the extra time or pay the extra cost for a reputable brand.",0
"(I couldn’t be happier): I upgraded my 5 years old laptop to this ASUS and before doing that I did quite a lot of online research. And I can not be happier. This device is fast, like really fast! I like the screen which produces very low levels of reflection, the (illuminated) keyboard has a satisfying “click” and travel, I love the metallic finish of the device and it’s very light to travel with. Overall completely happy. Only downside (being really picky) is that trackpad feels somehow “cheap” when clicking it… I mean, the device looks and feels so premium but the track pad feels like from another device… anyhow it works beautifully. Not a reason to complain. I absolutely recommend this lovely machine.",0
The cpu fan started wearing down and now makes a buzzing noise,0
(Keyboard light stopped working.): Horrible for more than 2k laptop. The keyboard light stopped working within the first week of purchase. Poor customer service from both manufacturer and distributor/seller.,0

the space bar is sunken in on the right side and works only half the time when pressed with the left thumb while touch typing.,0
(This will not work with regular printers): Has to be all cloud based printing and is a MAJOR HASSLE. I never did get it to work.,0
"(Perfect for part time gaming students): I've been using this pc for quite some time now. There is nothing exeptional about this laptop. First It's just perfect for students that do part time AAA gaming yet stay discreet about it while doing some project in the library with your classmates. This thing won't scream LOOK AT ME I'M A GAMER from a mile away and yet run the witcher 3 at 30fps with the settings optimized between high and ultra. Second, the bad viewing angle is unnoticeable horizontally but a liitle annoying vertically but it's not a deal breaker. And lastly, the speakers, I honestly didn't expect them, they blasted some trap music till the students next door could hear it. The bass is just clean deep",0
(Perfect!): Owned the previous version but spilled water on it. Replaced with this model. Touch screen very responsive. Easy operation!,0
(W): Useless POS Windows 10 S mode (nanny mode) & you can't disable it. Will only run apps from Microsoft -- couldn't run Canon scanner/printer or allow me to install software for it -- only reason I bought it.,0
(Died after 8 months.): chromebook stopped working and only had for 8 months,0
"(Not good, twice.): (Updated review at the end.)I've had this laptop for eleven days and I ordered a replacement two days ago, and now I'm very glad I did. Three days ago, the screen started having glitches, videos/pictures moving from left to right rapidly, the very top of the screen starting to lose pixels (I don't know if that's the correct terminology.) I tried to restart the computer and the power button in the start menu said ""There are currently no power options available."" I still have no idea what that means and I've /never/ had a computer do that before (I also couldn't find any helpful information on how to fix that, so I had to hard restart my computer.) I hadn't had too many problems, still occasionally pictures/videos moving, until tonight when the screen mirrored in half horizontally and over the course of a minute started fading into a completely white screen, while the video I was watching continued to play with no audio problems. I did another hard restart and it's currently working while I type this, but as a full-time college student I can't afford to have a laptop that might unexpectedly crash on me. Not to mention anyone who spends $400 on something expects it to work properly. I'm giving it a second chance, understanding that this could just be one damaged computer, and will update the review either way--but I'm extremely disappointed that I have to deal with this.Just under two weeks with the replacement laptop and the exact same problems were happening. I attached a video since I'm not having an easy time explaining what was happening. I thought at first it was the Hulu app causing problems, but I've had no trouble using it on another computer. It would also happen even when I was just doing homework, which caused an unnecessary amount of stress. I've seen enough positive reviews to know it may just be a fluke, but honestly I recommend just spending $100-200 more on another laptop if you have the means. Or there are plenty of cheap laptops at Best Buy and other places that aren't super high quality but shouldn't have glitches and at least you'll have person-to-person access for any possible problems.",0
"(My favorite device by far): So i had this computer chromebook for a year now, and i got to say. This is a very good device! I been using it a lot and the keyboard is easy to use and the touch screen is amazing! The battery life can be work on a bit, but it does perfom very well with heavy usage. I don't like the touch pad very much, maybe it's just me but i feel like it lags just barely. I bough a logitech mouse so its not a big deal for me, but even when i'm not home, i simply navigate using the touch screen so it doesnt effect me. I'm hook with chromebooks, if one day i ever need another one, i know what i will be looking for.",0

The product arrived and I was shocked at how lightweight it is! It’s so compact and looks amazing. Set up was a breeze, and I’ve already started using it with no issues. It is my first time using the chrome OS and it’s very user friendly and the graphics are great. Amazing product and price point.",0
(It's quite impressive by a used product from amazon warehouse ...): It's quite impressive by a used product from amazon warehouse. the only disadvantage is probably the computer speed. It's quite slow for a new computer (I mean it's new for me),0
"(The worst laptop I've ever used): I hate this laptop with every fiber of my being. The screen quality is weird and lacks clarity. I'm assuming the lack of brightness is supposed to be easier on your eyes, when in reality my eyes are straining. The mousepad is incredibly unresponsive and finicky, one moment doing nothing, the next moment I've somehow zoomed in. There's an ill-placed search key where caps lock should be, so that's fun to bump and suddenly derail my entire essay. You can't resize icons. I can't for the life of me save anything to my desktop, only pin it to the shelf. I'm not sure if I can return this waste of money, but lord I'm going to try.",0

(Out the box and the screen flickers!): My previous laptop was an ASUS U46E it worked great up until the last 6-9 months (it was old). I purchased this new ASUS laptop with some concerns about the screen issue so many people have mentioned. Well sure enough it flickers. Total failure on ASUS to send out a defective product especially since this is a KNOWN issue. Asus was not able to offer a solution so I returned the laptop.,0

"(Great laptop, great price,): This laptop works perfect, no issues.",0
"(Great value gaming laptop. We'll see how this ages in 6 months.): Update 9-10-20 - I've spent close to a couple months with this laptop now. After I received the replacement (bad fan bearing in CPU fan) I've been extremely happy with my purchase. I'd recommend installing the Offline Dragon Center utility as it seems more stable than the Windows Store version. Otherwise, it does everything I wanted. Don't expect mobile versions of the RTX 3000 series until at least next year, so if you want a good RTX mobile laptop right now rather than 4+ months from now, this laptop is still your best bang for the buck.Update 8-06-20 - After a couple weeks with my second GL-65, I'm very pleased with the laptop. If you have a defective laptop, don't be afraid to send it back to Amazon for replacement if it hasn't been a month yet.Update 7-22-20 - I've encountered my first problem; the left fan (CPU) appears to have a bad bearing, and when it spins up in the 4000-5000 RPM range, it will make a clicking noise. It gets worse when the laptop is tilted, making me believe it's indeed a bad bearing. These things happen and I'm okay with this as long as MSI gives me a decent path to a repair. Currently I opened a case with MSI to see if they'll just ship me the replacement fan (I repair laptops from time to time) to save the time and money that would be required shipping the laptop back. Failing that, I'll be requesting a replacement on Amazon.Update 7-22-20 : MSI support contacted me and informed me they could send a replacement fan, but I'd have to pay $10 to have it shipped to me. That seems reasonable, but I don't like that I'd have to pay to repair something I just bought. I'm a little tempted to dock the laptop a star, but I'll wait to see if the replacement has any issues first. I decided to simply return the laptop to Amazon for a replacement. It only took around 10 minutes and a replacement is on the way.Original Review:I've been laptop hunting for a couple months for a laptop that can (likely) play Cyberpunk 2077 when it comes out later this year. I came down to a handful of requirements:1.) GTX 1660 TI, RTX 2060 or RTX 2070. AMD mobile cards are unproven at the moment, but the 5600m came in slightly faster than the GTX 1660 TI, so I wasn't ruling it out. It's just rare right now.2.) Either an AMD Ryzen 7/9 CPU or 10th gen Intel i7/i9.I was very close to buying the ASUS ROG G14, but the RTX 2060 MaxQ runs at 1660 TI levels and is the least powerful RTX card that exist. Ray Tracing is a token feature when it will barely run on it. I also came close to buying the Asus G15, and even closer to the HP Omen 15 since it had a RTX 2070 and appears to be a solid laptop.Then I found this laptop. The reviews are great, the thermal system is robust, the monitor is solid and the specs are perfect for this price range. ($1400-$1600)Pros:1.) One of the best i7-10750H + RTX 2070 laptops on the market. It's actually designed to handle the thermals of these two components.2.) The RTX 2070 is a 115watt mobile spec, meaning it's not a handicapped MaxQ part that runs closer to a RTX 2060. That means you have a full 8GB frame buffer and better RTX support.3.) The i7-10750H, while outclassed by the 3rd gen Ryzen 5/7/9 is an unlocked CPU, and this laptop allows you to fully manipulate it once unlocked in the BIOS. This is probably the best Intel mobile CPU you can currently have for gaming, as the i5 series is a little weak with only 4 cores and no ""K"" level manipulation.4.) The keyboard is quite nice. I immediately disabled the rainbow RGB and turned it all green. I like how it looks with solid colors. The trackpad is fine and I love the dedicated buttons rather than the silly ""Mono-slab"" popularized by Apple. Dedicated buttons are almost always better for power users. I use a USB wireless mouse anyway, but I appreciate the buttons.5.) The build quality, while very plasticy, is good. I was able to remove the bottom panel to install an extra 1TB SSD and was impressed by the excellent heat pipe design and layout.4.) Neither RAM module is soldered on, so you can upgrade to 32GB if you really want. Currently 16GB is ideal, which it comes with.5.) The MSI software, while clunky, is effective once you get used to it. I appreciate the ""Mode switch"" keys. Silent mode is impressive, in that it manages to keep the fans reasonable at ~3000 RPM while only losing 10-20% of your FPS at worst.6.) Performance in games is excellent. Red Dead Redemption 2 plays excellently at max settings, 1080p. Warhammer Total War 2 also plays great maxed out (maybe step back some of the excessive effects for 60FPS+) and I'm sure the rest of my games will do fine too.7.) The monitor/lid is sturdy, has very thin bezels for the top and sides. The bottom bezel is larger, but not bad. The webcam is tiny and actually there, something the Asus G14 is missing. The 144hz refresh rate is impressive and the screen hits 320 nits brightness, pretty close to ideal. There is some moderate backlight bleed, but this shouldn't be an issue in games.Cons:1.) Although it's not terrible, the MSI logo on the front lights up with the monitor's backlight and can't be turned off. It looks kind of cheesy and I wish it was just a solid lid with minimal logo.2.) The design is moderately gamery, with the bottom being a strange mess of design (but effective vents) and the lid ""ribs"" being a little cheesy. I think they really strengthen the lid however, so I won't complain too much. I like HP's 2020 refresh Omen 15 and Asus G14 designs better.3.) Playing with stock balanced mode settings, the fans can get very loud and the i7 CPU will happily run up to 95C and throttle. This is more of an Intel issue, as they have been falling behind in die shrinks compared to AMD, and suffering thermal issues as a result. However, I'll touch on this later, as it can be fixed.4.) It's a little heavy, but within reason. 5.1 pounds for the laptop and a big ~2.1 pound charger adds a lot of weight to your bag. I definitely notice it even though my previous laptop was 4.8 lbs with a 1 pound charger.5.) The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet. It'll annoy you if you don't like smudges.6.) Battery life is towards the bottom of most laptops, but you can improve it by disabling CPU boost. I get between 3-5 hours with normal web usage, and only an hour if gaming. You've got to tinker with it to pull 5 hours out. (Disable CPU boost, Max Battery mode, dim screen)7.) Although this is in the top range of ray tracing capable mobile cards, expect to be a little disappointed as Nvidia jumped the gun and needed another generation to truly make RTX enticing. You pretty much have to use DLSS 2.0 to make it usable, otherwise, expect unplayable framerates or lowered settings. If you are really wanting an excellent ray tracing capable laptop, you'll have to wait until next year when the next generation of AMD and Nvidia cards become available in mobile form and likely have much better ray tracing performance.8.) The speakers, while they can be cranked loud, sound tinny and have no bass and little midrange. I raised bass all the way to the top in the included Nahimic program and it kind of helps, but there's definitely something wrong with the design here. All the MSI marketing about ""giant speakers"" makes me disappointed by this second thought implementation. If you want good sound, hook up speakers, a HDMI display with sound or headphones.Overall, I'd recommend this laptop to anyone who wants to do some mobile PC gaming. It's durable and has great specs. The thermals are excellent for a laptop in this class, and it's an overall excellent value.Tips:1.) The CPU in any gaming laptop, AMD or Intel, will add unnecessary heat, as usual the GPU is the bottleneck. Try disabling CPU boost mode, and tinker with it. You can use Intel's XTU or Throttlestop if you're an advanced user, or even easier, search in Google for, ""Disable processor boost mode to prolong your battery life"" and try ""Disabled"" mode or play with settings until you find a happy place between thermals and performance. Some games run fine with disabled turbo, some don't.2.) The BIOS has an unclock mode to enable undervolting, overclocking, etc. Use with caution or not at all if you aren't very familiar with this. To enable it, press ALT + RIGHT-CTRL + SHIFT together then press F2 while in BIOS. This should enable the advanced mode. Again, be careful here.3.) Make sure to update all the drivers, as out of the box they are a mix of late 2019 and early 2020. There are new drivers available for almost every component. You can either get them directly from Windows Update, MSI's website, or Intel.",0

I’ve play monster hunter world on high as well as fallout 76. Just don’t expect desktop sound fans. The fans do produce a bit of noise, but only under load outside of that it’s quiet and the batter life is amazing for what this is.

"(Great Laptop for the money, and can be upgraded): Ive had my Razer for a few months now, and let me tell you, its a great piece of technology. Its easy to begin diving into the gaming world confidently with the laptop, without breaking the bank. I see alot of people saying the customer service of Razer isnt good, and that the laptop has heating issues, but I havent had either of these experiences myself. Razer has been nothing but helpful to me when I needed a screen replacement. (My LCD would flicker after a few hour of use) I had my laptop sent off and serviced within about a week or so. I do feel my device begin to heat up when running heavy games such as hours of Apex Legends, or heavily modded Skyrim, but the heating issues can be overcome by optimizing your system internal and overclocking the fans.

We use it for a few hours a day and only have to charge it every couple of days. My only issue is the camera quality.

The fan can get loud and the battery life isn’t great, but it’s expected.

"(First got the wrong laptop, then got a defective one): I really wanted to like this laptop because of the hardware, but I no longer trust gigabyte. At this price point, I would never expect to first receive the wrong item, a much cheaper laptop, and then have it replaced for a correct but defective model.Once I got things installed and restarted for the first time, the 15P XD would freeze within seconds after logging in. No Blue screen or error message, just a complete and irreversible freeze. The last time I remember this happening was in the early 2000s on an old Dell desktop. I factory reset the laptop multiple times using multiple recovery methods, and the problem persisted. Wasted 12 hours of my life. ""XD"" in the name is appropriate because this laptop is a joke.I blame gigabyte and not amazon because gigabyte was shipping directly to their distribution center. Also, their software/hardware is suspect for the cause of the issue. Amazon was helpful in processing the returns. I'm still waiting for my refund, though.",0
"(Random hardware crashes.): Have had this computer since 7/20 and it has been in for repair three times. I still have not received my daughters computer as it is still in Texas on the third repair. Even going through the factory repair suggestions and procedures, I still don't have the computer back. My daughter is heartbroken and need this for school. 750.00 dollars down the drain in my opinion. I would look elsewhere for a more reliable machine. You have been warned.",0
(Great Laptop.): A very nice Laptop. The display is beautiful.,0
"(Total junk- a lemon): Received yesterday. So far it's easy to use and pretty fast. The only bad thing is the screen resolution. It really is poor. Update, had to call acer tech support twice. It won't charge. Sent back for repair. At first they wanted to charge me for sending it back after owning for two weeks! Got it back, it still wasn't fixed. They sent a whole new power cord, it worked for a while but started the same again. What a piece of JUNK.",0
"(After 8 months of use and travel, solid like a rock so far - update): Quite happy with this laptop. Love the light weight relative to my T420S. Also like the keyboard, and display. Battery lasts for 3-6 hours depending on what's being run in my experience. Machine has logged a lot of miles so far. Can't comment on customer service as I've not had to use it. As of the date of this review, the price on Amazon is only about 10% less than I paid for it back in April 2018.Sept 2019 update. It's now 4.5 years old and still running strong. Replaced the battery. Upgraded the SSD. Does run warm on occasion.",0
THE TOUCHPAD IS BAD!,0
I purchased this laptop because I was looking for something affordable to get work done on and to watch some videos through YouTube and Netflix.,0
Keyboard keys have decent travel and is easy to type on.,0
(great buy): all it works happy for the price,0
"(Okay - it's only been a few weeks): But, I love this laptop. After asking multiple people who have purchased the same (or better) models and I couldn't be happier purchasing even the lowest end model of MacBook Air. Does everything I would expect an Apple Computer to do (for what I need it for, basic photo editing, viewing, and typing). So far it's been an amazing purchase. Just for the sake of keeping Apple on their toes I rated the Battery Life 4 stars and the camera quality 4 stars, as well as the 4 star overall review. Keep it up Apple, as long as you continue to make the products user-friendly I'll remain a happy customer for years to come.",0
(It's ok.): My daughter likes it.,0
"(Excelente dise?o.): Me gusta mucho el teclado, lo veloz que es el equipo, se puede jugar muy bien en ella y los programas para dise?o de ingeniería o arquitectura van muy muy bien, en resumen un buen equipo. Compra recomendada.Deberían resaltar mas la característica de que se pueden usar 3 discos duros al mismo tiempo (2 ssd y un disco duro normal).",0
"(Great laptop, good for gaming): Got this laptop a month ago, works great on highest graphics settings in heavy gamesAdded 1TB Samsung 980 NVME because 512 GB wasn't enough for meThe computer is very fast, looks great but the RGB is minimal, but its ok for me. also can use it for workthe cooling system isn't bad , you can boost fans when the laptop is hotwhen you boost the fans are kinda louds but while gaming I dont really care (using headphones anyways )the build quality looks good and RTX 3070 very powerful, also the CPU is good. Bought it for around 1200 dollars, worth the money",0
"(Good, battery sucks though.): Battery could be better for so much money.",0
(So far so good): Nice came exactly how it was stated delivered in good conditon. Came on time so far so good update in a few weeks,0
(Bien): Bien,0
"(No display through usb-c port): This is a great laptop, especially for the price. The backlit keyboard is a nice function, and it can be set to stay lit, just fire up NitroSense and click the gear icon in top right corner for settings.You will def need more storage space, can get 1tb externals pretty cheap now days. Everything worked great right out of the box.My only disappointment was that I bought a docking station to run multiple displays through the usb-c port. But that port doesnt support video I found out. You can still run another display through the hdmi port though, so its just a minor disappointment.All in all for the price, its awesome. Has run everything I've thrown at it and its quick too.",0
"(DISAPPOINTED): Very disappointed, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, I didn't even get that.",0
the cpu in this machine is not capable of meeting many games required specs.,0
"(Dell-Intel Counterproductive on the Screen Quality): Research ""DelI XPS color banding"" and ""Dell Intel graphics original color black screen"".I bought this laptop thinking I was getting a high end machine for video and photo editing. The colors and display are supposed to be accurate and adjustable. Instead, Dell and Intel somehow haven't been able to figure out how to work together. First there was terrible color banding, and dark/shadowing areas could hardly be seen because of the blocky color bands. When Dell Premier Color is removed, the whole screen goes black and you need to use an external monitor to uninstall Dell Premier Color, Intel Graphic Command Center, and the Intel display drivers, then reinstall the drivers. Intel Graphic Command Center has a reoccurring issue with color adjustments causing a black screen and requiring reinstallation of the display drivers.Other than this display issue, the laptop seems solid. Really unfortunate that a high price point laptop touted as being a perfect fit for content creators would have such debilitating issues with the display calibration.",0
(Good value for the money!): Well now I am impressed! Was sick of spending $400 on a computer and a year later they needed to be fixed. Bought this on sale hoping it would work for what I need. Fantastic!! Added my printer easier than on the computer! Works great!,0
"(Defective!): I have sent this brand-new laptop back to Dell and after three services, replacement of keyboard, daughter board replaced and an operating system reinstall, the cursor still jumps around while typing in a browser such as gmail or outlook making it impossible to compose email. Research shows that I am not the only one having issues. I've tried with touch pad on and off using a mouse and doesn't seem to matter. Soo frustrating. AND, this is the second one - first brand new laptop out of the box had a defective keyboard and wasn't able to even get up and running....Other than that I really like it...",0
(Best price and affordable.): I love that its small and take it anywhere. Wow! I recommend everyone should get this.,0
(Quick and easy.): Runs nice and quick. Breeze to set up. This is my first Chromebook. Not a complete replacement for a laptop but good for its purpose. No bloat ware which is nice. I was apprehensive that size would be too small but it is fine. I thought that 4G of RAM might be insufficient but browses fine.,0
"(Exelente): el envió fue muy rápido para mi cuidad - Arequipa Peru. caja de embalaje quedo algo arrugada, pero la caja interna de NITRO impecable",0
"(Laptop): Una Laptop llegando en tiempo y forma, sencilla en apariencia pero rápida con las características que se especifican en descripción.",0
After playing Overwatch for a bit I was blown away by this beautiful screen.,0
"(Decent laptop, some issues): It's a good laptop, but I have a few problems with it now after 2 years of light use. The first is audio: more often than not, I will have to hard reboot several times in order to get audio/microphones to work. This works with the original speaker audio and any headphones I try to connect to it, bluetooth or otherwise. The second is microphone quality. It's extremely quiet on the computer, but when I connect any headphones to it (ones that work fine anywhere else), I have to yell into them in order to have the other person faintly hear my voice. I've messed around with every setting in the computer and taken it to tech support, no luck. Otherwise it's a decent computer.",0
(Family loved it): Gave as gift to family member. They hugged it. End of story.,0
right out of the box is that the front right fan is making a vibrating noise and the battery life isn't that good.,0
"(Muy buena): Muy rápido y seguro, tengo dos meses con ella y estoy satisfecho con el producto.",0
(Excellent): RAS,0
I love the fact they removed the Windows key from the WASD side of the keyboard,0
(Gaming is not limited at all!): fantastic laptop highly recommend,0
"(Dont bother): Computer was so slow, kept shutting down, and had to return it. Terrible investment for college.",0
(Works well): Bought this for my mom and she likes it! No problems.,0
I use this laptop for casual video/photo editing and this laptop can easily finish these tasks due to its high-performance 6-core processor and amazing GTX 1060 graphics card,0
it is ultra portable which I like,0
The display is very good.,0
(WORST LAPTOP): Horrible laptop - DO NOT BUY. About to send in for its 3rd repair after only having it for 2 months.,0
(Buena laptop recomendada por el precio con oferta): De forma general está bien lo único negativo sería la duración de la batería y las altas temperaturas que alcanza en juegos,0
(Great intro laptop): Bought as a kid's first laptop and it is perfect in that space. Would be too under powered for more than browsing or flash-style games.,0
The SteelSeries keyboard has great feel,0
"(Great introductory Gaming PC): Exterior box came in a bit damaged, however it was still wrapped in cheapo packing paper, as well as another box with Styrofoam strictly for the Laptop.Seems to be a very user friendly PC, definitely great for starting the switch from console to PC gaming. With the deals offered on this item, it was simply a never pass up opportunity. Great mixture of components, with a solid name going to bat for design and parts.",0
"(Great deal, great product.): With this price and quality. This is just perfect.",0
The cooler boost is annoyingly loud.,0
(nice chromebook): so far this seems to do the job I want it to--I don't game so mainly I just use it for a few purposes,0
"(Make a Wish recipient is DISSAPOINTED!!!!): WOULD GIVE NO STAR IF WE COULD>>>My nephew purchased this computer as part of his Make a Wish opportunity. He was so excited to not have to ask his parents to play on their computer anymore to get into Roblox, Minecraft, Crossout and more! It worked for 3 days....THEN THE SCREEN WONT EVEN TURN ON!!!! $100 later having Acer's team fix it, and it is doing the same thing. If he lets the battery die, then SOMETIMES the screen will turn back on, but something isn't right if it wont always turn on like it is meant to. SOOOOO DISSAPOINTED. I would NOT recommend because if you buy a computer, you should be able to count on the screen turning on so you can use it! Amazon wouldn't help return or exchange, and ACER company has already ""done what they could""FRUSTERATING. It is sad to see him so upset that his WISH didn't work, and since covid 19 stopped him from going on a cruise with his family, then he should be able to game on a brand new computer without issues.NOT HAPPY THEY WONT FIX THE PROBLEM....FIGURE IT OUT ACER OR DO AN EXCHNGE AMAZON!!!!!!",0
"(Me permite ir a cualquier lado y llevarla conmigo.): En general estoy contento con esta laptop, me permite editar fotografías y vídeos de manera fluida. Aunque claro, vídeos cortos para redes sociales. No he intentado hacer algo con after effects o cosas más locas e intensas.Lo único que me hace poner 4 estrellas, es que empezó a sonar demasiado fuerte el ventilador, llevo como dos semanas con ella y hace este ruido al encender.No estoy seguro de si sea normal, solo me preocupa pensar que después de un tiempo se descomponga el ventilador. Espero que no.",0
"(Speakers sound is very low): I like the performance.I dislike:- The speakers. You have to use 100% volume and even though, it is not that loud.- Short battery life- Too much bloatware (pre installed software)",0
"(Extremely frustrating): I lost two laptops in the fall with the update. I tried installing my Office on this laptop, and it asked me for the key twice. The first time it said ""continue,"" but the second time, it said I couldn't use my software anymore because the key had been used too many times. I also had to download some special software from the microsoft store because they didn't recognize their own software. Then it said I was allowed to use my Office that I BOUGHT AND PAID FULL PRICE FOR for 29 days before it would stop working. So I tried to download the Microsoft word file that I had just uploaded from my other laptop to Microsoft OneDrive. It said I didn't have permission to view the file even though EVERYTHING is MICROSOFT and I am logged into EVERYTHING. The picture is that dull foggy look that makes me feel like my glasses are fogged up, and I'm not wearing glasses. My other, smaller, laptop is crystal clear. It took a really long time to install my software, and this has a solid state drive, but the laptop is so difficult to use that I want to throw it away. I'm very unhappy with it.",0
(Great laptop): I will keep it short. We use this laptop for general office work as well as editing video on location. It has been handling both tasks really well. No problems at all. My only complaint is how easily fingerprints show all over the thing but I don't really care about that very much. Would recommend for sure.,0
"The serenity this fanless-architecture computer provides is simply wonderful. It operates in complete silence, allowing you to focus on your tasks without distractions.",1
"It boots quickly, and it runs fast.",0
(💝💝 love Samsung products): 💝💝 love Samsung products!!,0
"(Light, powerful and awesome): The touch screen is very responsive, and the stylus is great. I love how quickly it boots up, and that it lasts all day on 1 charge",0
(Excellent product): This was used for a golf simulator at home,0
"(Fast internet browsing, light weight, simple easy to use): I wanted something to browse the internet. It seems like everything I use eventually starts getting sluggish in response.Not this Samsung Chromebook, it's even better than I had hoped. It's fast, responsive and light. And surprise, you can Right Click just like Windows. I can't tell you how much that means to me! It's just a great product.I got a refurb from Arc Deal and it is packaged and looks just like a new product. I couldn't be more satisfied.",0
(Awesome): Great laptop for the price.,0
(Great laptop): I've always has hp laptops but I'm really happy with this one.,0
(Decent W11 machine for the price): A lot of buyers complain that OS allows MS programs to be installed. You can bypass this feature at first boot up.I struggled to get to the BIOS but found you had to press ESC and F2 at the same time to boot into the bios. I had to disable secure boot in order to install Linux Mint alongside W11. Now I have a nice dual OS machine. Linux installs a Grub Boot screen that allows you to choose your OS at start up.I like this unit because it has full size USB ports plus an Ethernet cable port along with standard head phone jack.,0
(Five Stars): Love this! Bought it for my son and he enjoys everything about it.,0
An annoying tiny green pixel dot on the screen,0
(Best decision in a Chromebook): My 10 year old son loves it and has found it easy to use! Great investment!,0
(I enjoy all the stuff I have order.): I like it lighter then the old one,0
"(No Nvidia graphics card?): Great overall laptop but when I bought it it seemed fine but now the graphics aren’t measuring up to what they should be, turns out the laptop I bought never came with the Nvidia Gefore graphics card that said the laptop had. When trying to figure out what it meant i’ve opened up Nvidia control panel only to get the response of “No Nvidia graphics card detected”. If i’m doing something wrong help would be much appreciated.",0
The graphics card is solid and can power 4 displays,0
"(So far, so good.): I have had the laptop for a month and have not had any issues. The unit showed very little signs of wear which is nice. For the specs, it is well worth the price. I like how the keys light up, it has been nice when in a dark room. It is plenty fast as well.",0
(Doesn't work after 3 months.): Constant reboots itself which is probably a couple fan or overheated cpu. Contacted extra warranty I purchased and told to go to place I purchased. Did that and was told to contact HP. Guess shame on me for buying from Amazon to begin with.,0
(unusable.): high cpu usage with 1 browser open,0
(Working great for school): Been using this model for at least three months. Powers up fast. Good battery. Light weight and feel like good quality.,0
(Very happy): I am very satisfied with this laptop. Happy ending to a lengthy search and process!!! Thank you Amazon!,0
(Huge waste of money!!!!!): This is the biggest piece of garbage ever made. I had one and it crashed within a month of using it. Got a replacement and that crashed in less than 2 weeks. I don't know how this has 4 stars. It is a pile of trash!,0
(Buena compra): Llegó bien me agrada ?,0
"(MUST KNOW!! I bought 2 and last gen): If you want it for gaming, BUYIf you want it for school, BUYIf you want it for travel, BUY one with more batteryThis laptop is awsome, low budget, cool, gamer, also fancy, just battery, for some reason some days the battery doesn't last, not all of the days, im talking like 4h with only using wordIts small, not heavy, shipment came at timeFOR GAMES*rainbow ?????*gta ????*GTFO?????*SW Battlefront 2 ?????Just almost every game at high settingBEWARE!!I recomend an Fan, just so you dont kill the pc with stong programsThe laptop makes loud noiseIf you want the nitro 5 i7 or the i9, its 100% better i9 just for the fan manegment",0
(nice small laptop): i wanted something small to do hw and i didnt want anything expensive since i'll only do school work in it and nothing else. I'ts quite amazing. I recommend. didn't came broken or anything,0
(Updated review: NO EXTERNAL DISPLAY): Overall this is a nice cheap laptop that has been very reliable.I have however spent a small fortune trying to connect this laptop to an external display. Reading through the support FAQ site and have concluded this laptop is incapable of supporting to an external display. I guess that's ok for high school or even undergraduate work but completely unacceptable for business work.Adding insult to injury is that the Manufacturer FAQ site is very difficult to use. I've tried registering to post a question but the automated site does not allow me to establish an account to ask.,0
(It’s not the best for school): It’s slow and I don’t like the controls it’s not a good laptop too for school,0
Great performer and excellent build quality.,0
"(THIS LISTING IS FOR REFURBISHED, False Advertisment!): Wished I had read ALL of the reviews before purchasing. I could have paid less for a listing that lets me know the computer is refurbished. This does not specify that it is and I did not receive a NEW chrome book. Extremely disappointed. I may just return it.",0
"(Battery Life is horrendous.): Needs to be plugged in to run any game with decent quality. Once it is plugged in, the laptop usually will overheat and shut down and restart. This problem even persists WITH the use of external fans. Unfortunately it is impossible to play anything without your device being plugged in or it will drain the battery completely in less than an hour. I was really excited for this laptop and apparently even my 1 year warranty cannot help me out with this issue. The sad truth is to enjoy anything fun you need to waste your money on problems that shouldn't exist in my opinion. It was a good laptop for a little under a year though. What prompted my review is it overheating on me 3 times within a span of 40 minutes. I'm very disappointed in myself for not researching further before choosing this device.",0
"(WARRANTY EXPIRED): I've only had my computer for a couple of days. I just finished registering it on the ASUS page and got a notice that the 5 yr warranty is expired. This should not be since I just purchased it BRAND NEW. I don't usually give a review until I've used a product for a few months, but I had to warn others of this issue.",0
"(Giant Android Phone): It’s a great product if you want a Chromebook and don’t mind that every application is web based. My son called it a “giant portable phone, passing itself off as a computer!” It literally operates like our cell phones, do include needing to download the android version of MS applications. You can use Google docs; however, you can’t use any word processing applications unless you’re connected to the internet. It also lacks certain familiar keys on the keyboard, so you will need to Google the keyboard shortcuts. The Chromebook was frustrating to me. Thank goodness Amazon let me return it!",0
"(Laptop Muscle): I was quite intimidated before I bought it as I’ve never owned a gaming laptop. It’s powerful, stays cold, runs flawlessly. Even the fans aren’t even that loud. I’d even consider it overkill for many games. For reference, you’d be running minimum 130 fps at max settings for rainbow six siege. If your hesitant like I was, it’s definitely a safe bet to go with the acer predator.",0
"(Very good quality): The Legion 5 is a great laptop, with a well designed chassis, with a good cooling system and great performance. Howeve, the battery life is not spectacular.",0
"(Not at all like the old Chromebook): I don't know what this is but I wanted a Chromebook to replace my old one which I LOVED. This thing gets hot. It apparently needs updates?? I'm not sure what that's about. I've had safety issues as well. This reminds me more of a laptop than a Chromebook. I didn't want to worry about viruses, safety issues, or updates, which was the whole point! I you want a tiny cheap laptop this is for you but if your looking for fast worry-free internet surfing well I don't know what to tell ya. Be sure and get a lap pillow because the battery gets HOT right out of the box.",0
(Nice performance for i3 when upgraded): I put more memory in this machine courtesy of the RAM slot and popped a 2TB M2 drive in place of the factory 128GB. Nice! I don't use the laptop for gaming but my web based work and stuff I do on excel is quick and responsive. I like the build quality. I don't care for the track pad since it's shifted a bit to the left. The keyboard action is terrible and I find it very hard to type. I'm sure I'll get used to it. I'm used to my Dell Latitude E7270. I think the Dell has better colors on the screen.,0
"(Funciona correctamente): Justo lo que esperas de una marca tan reconocido y con el precio que tiene. Contras batería dura poco, No es poderosa para vídeo juegos corre Minecraft correctamente pero poco más. Ventajas pantalla de lo mejor, el retroiluminado es fantástico, es muy rápida para productividad no da lag jamás",0
They have the ABSOLUTE worst customer service.,0
(Do not waste your money with pre loaded windows that puts tons of roadblocks for the average person): Hate it. pre loaded windows has a but of sign ups and steps and account creations to just use google chrome. Total wastes of time and money and more time. Hate it . hate it. hate. Totally frustrated and will never buy a product again with pre loaded windows.Always have in the past. Never again. disgusted they would do this. So all or nothing windows.Well nothing looks good now.,0
The space bar has the same sunken in and lack of responsiveness on the left side too,0

"(Fantastic. Perfect for students!): I'm a student who does all of my work on my laptop and 2 months in, I'm really liking it!Some people are complaining of a black screen after a week or two of use which is really unfortunate and should be fixed on Acer's part, but the machine itself is wonderful in my opinion.Pros:+ Light (1.2kgs), portable, fits easily in any bag.+ Crazy fast boot times and storage speeds. Shut down to log in in less than 7 seconds. Having only an SSD helps!+ The display is actually quite nice, I think. Good colors, small bezels.+ Build quality is good, minimal keyboard flex.+ Battery life is pretty damn good. I'm averaging about 7-9 hours with web browsing, and some video.+ Trackpad is fairly large, responsive, Windows precision drivers, so gestures work smoothly.+ Backlit keyboard is comfortable to type on.+ Fingerprint scanner takes a little while to get used to, but now it works for me quickly about 95% of the time.Mehs:- Hinge is pretty stiff tbh, takes 2 hands to open the laptop.- To my knowledge the ram is limited to 8gb, (though somewhere I read you can max out to 12 gigs).In general, the experience so far has just been really convenient and quick. From the bag to logged in, ready to work takes only a few seconds and 2 months in, I couldn't be happier!",0
"(Excellent Combination of Work and Play.): A great laptop for most everyday uses and gaming. It does well at all the games I've tried, COD, OW, LOL, etc.The fan system works well to keep it cool but can be a bit noisy from time to time. Built in audio is ok, but nothing that will rock the house.Screen is a fantastic one, fast refresh and clear images no matter what I'm doing.",0

"(Great laptop.): Rather than list all the positives, I'll just list the negatives. Much shorter list.Battery is atrocious as is the speakers and Webcam.512GB SSD is very lacking size wise, but added another 2TB SSD as there are 2 slots for for SSD drives and another for 2.5 inch hard drive. Ram is also easily upgradable.Fantastic price/performance here.",0
"(great for the price): Met most of my expectations, great for the price. The only negative is the screen at different viewing angles.",0
"(Love): Came faster than expected,might weight and advance best little investment u can make for working from home . No complaints yet",0
"(Great, lightweight, and runs Linux like a champ.): After I got this, I installed Ubuntu Mate on it with no issues at all. Has been my daily travel laptop, replacingmy Chromebook. Haven't had any issues, and am more than happy with my purchase.",0
"(Good): This was easy to set up. It was a bit of a hassle to transfer files, but not too bad. It is working great for homeschooling and other family needs.",0
"(Slower than my old macbook air which is 7 years old): I bought this laptop to replace my older macbook air. I'm shocked at how slow it is. I never had the spinning on my other one that I have on this one. I don't get it. I'm tempted to return it for a different macbook. I got a macbook because I hated how slow windows is. this is still faster than windows, but it acts like windows when you need to update it. This macbook is up to date so I don't know why it's acting like a windows computer. VERY DISAPPOINTED!Is there an update. I get more frustrated with this laptop than any windows I have ever had. My old macbook air, smoked this one. I never got booted off of wifi with my old one. I sure hope they have an update that fixes this issue. I told my friends to hold off on purchasing a new macbook air because no one has time for the spinning and getting booted off that happens constantly.I do not recommend unless they have an update to fix the problem.",0
(Exceesive heat loud fan and defective headphone jack): Poor fan with excessive random loud noise and the headphone jack isn't working. Just completely the worst experience of buying it. I don't recommend this to be bought. Especially from this seller. They have defected models.,0
"(Very good laptop but some minor unpleasantries): I originally had one of the first Strix laptop models made and it was amazing. Sadly, the old girl finally stopped working due to a malfunctioning motherboard, but that was after some years of use for schooling, gaming, and other entertainment. I was distraught and had tried the Zephyrus G to no avail. It simply was not the same. Not to mention I bought that one open box at Best Buy which was a mistake because the leader of their Geek Squad who certified it couldn't tell me why it stopped working nor could he perform some basic computer functions which I had to end up helping him with. Regardless, the refund I received I held onto until I found the Strix Scar II and it was almost as if I had found my favorite laptop all over again but with some upgrades! I made my purchase and waited eagerly. When it arrived, I was very careful in unboxing it, even being thorough to check every bit of it and its components such as the charged. The laptop itself has proven to be just what I was looking for, minus some things. First, there is a small light bleed to the right of the laptop that is noticeable on darker cutscenes in movies, shows, and games. Second, I'm not big on the start-up noise being so loud and have yet to find how to mute it, if I can even do so. Third, while the space is nice, I had hoped for a bit more akin to what my original Strix had which was 2TB internal, though I could upgrade to that or more easily enough.I do prefer how the ROG center key (renamed Armoury Crate) has been placed toward the top left because I found it was in the way of my previous laptop and I would accidentally activate it. The customizable lighting and effects are very cool, especially when it does like a pulse when in sleep mode. I don't know how to feel about the more open fans just below the keys as I could see that making them more prone to breaking. The hinges seem durable. However, the cooling setup needs some changes. It's not really changed since the older models which can cause overheating easily and is noticeable when playing certain games.I do like how the keyboard came with the number pad as I am so accustomed to using one and felt lost when the Zephyrus G didn't (plus the placement of the arrow keys was annoying). I would have like for the 'F' keys to not be spaced after each five keys, but I'm loving the clear WASD. To me, that's just a nice aesthetic.I can see the ASUS cameras haven't improved as this one is very poor quality, same as my last Strix and others I've used. It's not a big deal as I'm not one to really use it, but I would expect much better quality that what it is currently and apparently has been. For smoothness of gameplay, I haven't noticed any lack of that. In fact, it seems to hold with excellent quality.When I was unboxing things, I noticed the charger was scuffed up, sort of like it was used. Which is odd since I ordered this new. The size of the screen is perfect and the keys have a nice texture to them, but I will be getting a clear silicone cover to protect them from wear.The updating lid design is very appealing as it the placement of the eye when you open the lid. I'm not very keen on the location of the mic nor the camera, but again I don't really use those so it's no big deal. The 144Hz 3ms sticker is a bit obnoxious, but I'll probably leave that there. I would like to suggest not only changes to the cooling, but also a way to better clean under the keys as no matter how careful someone is, things will get under them and trying to clean that not only scratches things up but risks braking the brackets underneath.Ultimately, if you are looking for a very good laptop, I recommend this one. It's not the newest and isn't an absolute beast for gaming and other stuff, but it's pretty up there in terms of quality. Make sure it gets airflow toward the back, sides, and underneath. Be prepared for that start up noise. If even a small bit of light bleed bugs you too much, do not get this. You can change the keyboard lighting in the installed Aura Center. Remember to uninstall ""bloatware"" like those stupid games they install on it such as Candy Crush and GardenScapes or whatever. You can always upgrade storage space either by getting new harddrives, investing in Asus cloud storage, or both. You can also upgrade the ram but be careful getting into the guts because you can easily break the plastic tabs that hold the case together beyond just screws. If you don't want stuff installed immediately when you start this up for the first time, press FN and F12 to put it into Airplane mode which disables wifi. Also disabled Cortana asap and deselect Microsoft permissions of how they can use your information. If you need a list of bloatware and other unimportant/unwanted things to take off the machine, just search whatever variation of that question and you should find answers. Including for that annoying xBox Game Bar. Do not forget to prohibit automatic installs of computer updates, especially lately due to all the problems with Windows.That's all I can really thing of. Great game, heed some of the minor problems. Take care of it and it will take care of you!",0
(First Chromebook): I’ve never used a Chromebook before this one but I’m shocked at what a good device it is for my needs and at such a great price.Highly recommended.,0
(Great computer): Great price and great computer!!,0
"(Screen flickers fresh from the box): I would not recommend this laptop due to screen issues. I have seen multiple other reviews/videos with the same issue. The Screen flickers in and out quite frequently.Seems to be because they put the cable up against one of the hinges, as well as other hardware malfunctions that keep occurring.DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP",0
"(Awesome Computer with only one Drawback): I love the computer and am so glad I purchased it. It is super fast and has been a joy to revisit many of my Steam games that I used to run at medium graphics/distance settings. Now those same games set me at ""high"" or ""ultimate"" graphic settings.I am an occasional WOT player. The speed of the laptop helps tremendously in gameplay and the higher graphics help to hone in those sniper shots.My only disappointment is that the battery life is only about 1 hour. I understand the limitation due to the power requirements to deliver the performance. One can see how much power is required by the size/gauge of its cord. I have an engineering laptop I use at work and this laptop cord is very similar to that level of computer.I would definitely buy again and at the price it is offered at its a ""no brainer"" for me.",0
"(Happy Performance): Sure beats my old one. Better graphics, better sound, and faster. I was also happy that it does not fry my lap. It cools down really quick too.",0
"(A Pile..): Signed into the chromebook for the first time and it worked for three minutes. System locked up , spent almost two hours on the phone with Acer to try to fix it . The operating system was corrupted and damaged . Sent it back! Last time I will purchase a computer online at any online store. I will pay more locally for electronics, but it will be worth it.",0
"The anti-glare or matte finish on this device's display has been kind to my eyes. It reduces eye strain and fatigue during prolonged use, making it a great choice for long work days.",1
Screen is a little dim in the sun,0
"(It’s extremely slow): The whole system was slow and lagged, took days just to sign into my email and update. But I sold it since I was unable to return.",0
"(works very good): Almost as new, clean, battery taking full charge, window 10, its just a great lap tob.",0
Some units have more backlight bleed,0
"(It works.): No complaints. For the cost it’s a good value. The complete inability to adjust the display quality and it’s washed out appearance make it a certain gift to someone else, not what I really needed. You get what you pay for.",0
"(fine keyboard, good screen): A pleasant keyboard and screen - can get a bit warm on the keyboard when graphics card is working. Not a touch screen unit.",0
"(Best laptop ive ever had!): I’m really happy with this purchase because I’ve wanted a MacBook for a long time and when I finally wanted to save up for it the day I bought it, it went to 899 and I was happy",0
"(Good Portable Laptop): I've been impressed with the laptop, especially on battery performance and portability. It handles most of the tasks, with minimal cases of overheating and increased fan noise.",0
(Great value): Huge screen beautiful and fast.Weak battery life,0
the display is crisp and the colors are vibrant.,0
"(Meh.): I don't like how confused I am when using it. I couldn't figure out how to copy and paste and it's also a really small screen. I was expecting a different operating system, I suppose. My husband seems to have no problem with it though. All in all it's a decent laptop, but not for me as it wasn't what I was expecting.",0
(Very please with this purchase): Works well. Fast delivery.,0
I can't emphasize enough how convenient the automated file syncing feature is. It keeps my files in sync across multiple devices by automatically updating new data to all devices on the same network.,1
(Is good enough for me): It's good for quite a few games RAM and memory could be better though along with battery life (depends on what you have running) and it cooks my crotch kinda.,0
(Great! For price.): My only complaint is this thing will not print! I can only save documents and that’s fine I will just use my phone. It’s verb perfect for two kids who use it for school.,0
"(Very Happy Birthday!): The computer is still pretty new, but she hasn't stopped using it, so I think the battery life is great, super light weight, and the value was very worth it.",0
"(At Home laptop computer): Affordable lightweight laptop, with a ten key. Easy to use. Love it",0
(Great gaming laptop): I returned this unit because came with a dead pixel on the screen but I order another one because I really like this laptop I think that for the price you can’t find better deal-configuration i7 11800h+Rtx 3060.I play any game 1080p max settings and I always get 60+ frames is just a very good all around gaming laptop for the price.,0
"(Stopped working a week after return time line. So disappointing): Lasted about 2 months, waist of money",0
it has a mode where it will use 50% of the battery and then start to charge to prolong battery life.,0
"(Excellent Laptop): It came like described, although it's fine I will upgrade memory and SSD",0
"(Screen started getting sketchy on day 4): Worked great the first few days, but I was planning on already sending it back -- idk, just didn't really like it for some reason. Couldn't be more specific than aesthetic and the feel of the keyboard. However, today, the screen is starting to lose resolution, and gets all shaky and blurry. DEFINITELY sending back now.",0
(Good Chromebook): I'm really impressed with this laptop. When reading the reviews I was a little worried about it but I knew it wouldn't be like a regular windows based laptop. I wanted something smaller that I can travel with. It has completely met my expectations for what I wanted.,0
"(Great gaming and power for the price!): This laptop has done everything I have asked it to do!(CoD, Apex, Valorant, GuildWars2) Turbo is LOUD but I overclock and have good ventilation and a fan stan I almost never hear my fans, but it's nice to know if they need to go max THEY WILL!",0
"(Perfect!!): Thanks alot for the 1 day service. It saved the day!! I love my laptop!! It was super easy to do an update,set up wifi and bluetooth immediately. I was up and using my laptop within 10 minutes of receiving it.Yea!!",0
"(Amazing gaming laptop for the budget!!): I did expect something amazing, and i ended up with a monster!This laptop is capable of intense gaming while doing other tasks such as music, video-editing, streaming, chatting, etc. It would handle almost anything with no issues at all.Pros:- 144hz Screen- Powerful GPU/CPU- Runs anything to be honest lol.- RGB Keyboard looks fancy and can be modified at preference.Cons:-CPU overheating. It's better if you get a cooling pad or something to help you out with the heat dissipation.- Speakers are not the best, but are decent.- USB Ports are located on the right side where you would usually locate your mouse if you are right-handed.- Fans might be a little noisy, easy to fix if you use headset (won't even notice).Design is good. It's thin and lightweight for a gaming laptop.Overall, a good laptop. Only thing you should worry about is the CPU overheating when there heavy-loads. But other than that, this is a beast!",0
"(Una excelente compra): Esta laptop ha sido mi primera compra por amazon, estoy totalmente satisfecho, tanto con el producto como con el servicio de envio, la laptop corre 10/10, es todo lo que puedes esperar de una laptop con el precio accesible que tiene y es realmente facil de agregar upgrades tu mismo, aumentando ram y disco tendras un equipo para un buen rato, tanto para trabajo como juego aficionado.",0
"(Muy buena compra): Llegó bien sellada, totalmente NUEVA. Empacada súper bien. Llegó antes de la fechaMuy satisfecha con la compra y kn el vendedor",0
the keyboard is a little flimsy,0
(Problem Specs): Is Core i5 10th or 11th ? This use Ram ddr4 not ddr3 The specs it's not clean,0
(Acer): ALL WE EVER ASKED FOR,0
(Cheap don’t buy): I’ve had this computer for less than 6 months. I use it maybe an hour or two a day if that. The keyboard is fading and the shift keys feel like they are going to fall out. This laptop has a cheap feel. I’m unsure I’ll be able to see the keys in a few more months.,0
"(Can’t use Camera): This laptop is driving me crazy. Whenever I try to use camera, it says that “we can’t find your camera”. I tried everything to solve this problem but couldn’t success. It’s totally waste of money.",0
"(NOT ENOUGH MEMORY EVEN FOR BASIC NECESSARY SOFTWARE): MY wife bought a brand new Dell Inspirion 3180 and it stopped functioning in two months simply because there was not enough storage for the software programs on the Dell Inspirion 3180. Look at your average computer. It has at least 40 or 45 gigs of necessary software. What are you going to do with only 32 gigs on the Dell Inspirion 3180. And that includes your personal stuff. There is not even room for that on the Dell Inspirion 3180. Selling the Dell Inspirion 3180 is literally theft. It is like buying a brand new car and not being told that there is no engine. And the Dell Inspirion 3180 can not be upgraded. Dell ripped off millions of people when they sold the Dell Inspirion 3180.But it gets worse. Dell new that the Dell Inspirion 3180 would not have enough memory to function so they included a system to download the upgrades you need on the Dell Inspirion 3180 onto a remote drive like a flash drive, but that does not work. I have been trying for two days to download the upgrades I need for my Dell Inspirion 3180 to function properly and it simply will not work. And how much slower would the Dell Inspirion 3180 be if it constantly had to access the thumb drive for the software it needs. And of course I had to buy a new stick. It must be a big one because the Dell Inspirion 3180 needs over 20 gigs of up.grades. So I had to run out and buy a 64 gig thumbdrive to try and make this lousy Dell Inspirion 3180 work and I must always plug it in or the Dell Inspirion 3180 will not work. But it is not working. The upgrades will not download onto the thumb drive. Teh point is that the Dell Inspirion 3180 is utter, complete, absolute, unequivocal, indisputable, irrefutable trash",0
The size and weight are great and the performance is excellent!,0
"(Ubuntu Linux worked great after I disable the secure boot function. Very nice!): I'm a linux person, not a windows or macos person. So after going into bios, (f1 or escape, if i recall) (f12 for boot selection), I then just had to disable secure boot, and ubuntu installed and ran very smoothly. Wifi ran without any driver installation whatsoever. It's been great!",0
"(This Ryzen 5 2500u throttles after 3 minutes running Prime95.): This Ryzen 5 2500u throttles after 3 minutes running Prime95. AMD know about their ryzen laptop cpu have throttling issue, and stupidly, it's designed this way. Google disable STAPM. Also google amd ryzen Clover as that's another potential fix but no promise.",0
"(Very fast for the price not great connections to flash drives, camera cards, the Internet): Just love how fast it boots up fast which is what I was looking for.However, this one's connectivity is not good. First, I have had a few Wifi disconnects I don't have on my previous HP or have with my phone on the same desk. I would never buy a computer w/o an ethernet outlet ever again. This one's ports do not handle flash drive or camera media cards on its ports all so well. The media card is hard to remove and one got damaged: the little plastic slide to indicate write protected fell off. I have to tug hard to remove a USB. Also it doesn't read some of my USB's. I hope my old HP holds up.",0
"(The warranty and customer service sucks): The worst experience I have before with electronic devices, computer break down within the period of warranty, went to suggested spot, the technician saying have to break it down to fix but HP doesn't responsible at all. DONT PURCHASE THIS, go to grab a apple computer, definitely more expensive but worth more",0
"(Excellent computer. Good quality design and nice specs): I paid 1.150$ for a decent gaming laptop and I couldn't be happier. Yes the charger brick is chunky and the battery life isn't on a macbook's level, but it's a great machine for the price and I think I got what I paid for. I was between this and the Acer Nitro 5 (which I have had before) and this bought me with a cleaner design.The multicolor keyboard was a little too much for me but luckily you can configure it to the color you want, and I chose white.",0
"(Awesome): This is an awesome laptop. I use it almost daily. Great with Microsoft products (word, excel, etc), did not disappoint!!",0
(amazing product! definitely recommend :)): i love this so much! i ordered this when the sale was going on so it was the perfect opportunity and i’m soo happy i chose those laptop. the battery is ok and will last around 2 1/2 to 3 hours high is good depending on the game you play. as a pretty avid minecraft player i’d say the batter is sufficient. would definitely recommend!!,0
(Durability): Is a decent little laptop for a starter it was easy to upgrade plus the room for the extra nvme and hard drive was nice plus the fact that it has an Nvidia 1650 GTX or RTX I don't remember is actually pretty decent giving the fact that I like to play my VR games PC VR which after upgrading the ram it is allowed to 8 gigabytes of RAM definitely needs to be upgraded immediately only suggestion I have people who buy it also I would suggest putting in at least some more storage otherwise durable decent easy connectivity,0
(amazing pc): amazing pc,0
"(This Thing is Actually Amazing): Ive had this computer for 2 months now, and I still can’t find a single thing to complain about. The battery will last me 12 hours of gaming, something I didn’t think was even possible out of a high-performance laptop. When I say high performance, I mean it. This thing runs Minecraft on 60 fps with fancy graphics and 24 chunks of render distance; and it doesn’t even get hot! This is probably one of the best tech purchases I’ve ever made.",0
It's very light in the hand for its screen size.,0
(Was a Xmas Gift): This Chrome Book is a very good unit and continues to perform very well. Some quirks you have to learn about with Chrome but otherwise perfect for the internet junkie.,0
"(Dissatisfied): Unfortunately, most games I've played on the new laptop freezes after 5 mins of gameplay.",0
"(Very Good): I purchased this for my two high schoolers after their 1st Chromebook wore out. Works very well, low power, very compact. My only complaint is that the recharger plug/jack is very thin and might be prone to breaking.",0
(Nice laptop): I only wish it had come with Microsoft office/word which I didn’t know when I purchased it,0
(Easy to use): Very easy to set up and use,0
The only problem is that the delete key is right next to the on/off key.,0
"(Muy buen equipo de cómputo precio calidad y productividad): Funciona realmente muy bien, pero por la capacidad los juegos de más alta gama ya no con todas las características pero por lo demás excelente",0
(Shipped quickly!!): We will be using these laptops for our office director and personnel. It is great to know that we can use them as tablets out on the field and have signing capabilities.,0
"(Decent, not great): Decent for surfing web or online shopping. Just simply lacks the computing horsepower to do ""Zoom"" or ""FaceTime"" like apps with any proficiency.",0
(I'm happy): This is a great computer!,0
(It's quite nice for the most part): Just about the only thing I have objections to is that I don't really like the touchpad much. It doesn't always behave intuitively and I've had to tweak settings to get it to where I'm fairly comfortable using it.But generally... Solid laptop. Good buy.,0
(Sucks): This is the worst computer I have ever had. Sucks sucks sucks.,0
The screen is simply amazing. I watch sports videos on it and they are super crisp.,0
(Absolutley Terrible): On the rare occasion I can get the thing to turn on. It takes 15 minutes to warm up.Using the internet is painfully slow. Even being the only device connected to my router. With 150 Mbps. (I intenetspeedtest.com'd it from another device.) it absolutely crawls.I cannot have more than about 2 tabs open in a browser at any time or the system starts spinning and the computer becomes useless.My son bought these for myself and his assistant to use and we cant even use them.Waste of money,0
(First laptop): Love the processor and everything. only wish i could control the keyboard colors,0
The right angle power adapter cables (on both sides) always seem to get in the way and often yank the laptop dangerously,0

"(Potencia de sobra): Corre lejos cualquier juego a este a?o, todo realmente me gusto de esta computadora",0
(Perfect): Works great for taking online classes,0
"(Lovely design, beautiful screen, and nice gaming): This laptop is great. The only thing I don't like about it is the Aorus Control Center software which feels like an overzealous anti-virus with the things it meddles with. BUT once I setup my RGB keyboard pattern, I uninstalled it and it's good to go, you don't really need it to begin with.",0
arrived with a dent in one speaker and bad backlight bleed in one spot at the bottom of the screen.,0
(Everything you need for work): Great for AutoCAD and electrical engineering software!,0
"(Five Stars): Perfect for school. Bought it for college, and it's been doing a good job with little to no problems!",0
"(Best all-around laptop I've ever owned.): I have used many Windows and MacBook laptops. This was intended as a second laptop in addition to my MacBook Pro 2017 (15""). The prices on high-powered gaming capable devices are lower than they've ever been.- I don't play the most modern games but I have some titles that I tried that I knew many older ones that had given me problems in the past. These are titles from 3-10 years ago, so it's not the most updated test, but everything is smooth and fast at the highest settings.- From a hardware standpoint, I love the muted design that makes it look more professional than ""gamey."" The keyboard and mousepad are the best I've ever tried on a Windows laptop (I expected that from Lenovo). While the machine is mostly plastic, the plastic feels solid.- I almost customized a machine from Lenovo but realized that I could only get one with a 144Hz display directly from Amazon. I'm very glad I did. The display is obviously not as sharp or vibrant as what I have on my MacBook but I see it serving a different purpose with its 144Hz display. The display surface is also matted rather than glossy, so you don't get sharp reflections coming off the screen (which I like).- I know there's a way to add more storage to this, so I'll look into it. The 512GB built-in is a good start.- The cooling on this laptop is extremely well done with large vents underneath and four outtake vents. The display hinge does not get in the way of the fans and you can still bend it all the way back 180 degrees.- Most of the connections are at the back with markings to show you from the top where they are located. On the side, you have the standard USB 3 on each side and a headphone jack on the left.- Sound is better than I expected, but my expectations were low there. This definitely is nowhere near as rich as my MacBook but that was not expected.- The power brick is ginormous, but it's 270W (that's higher than PSUs I used to put in desktops once upon a time). It obviously limits the mobility of this machine but no one expects an ""ultra portable"" when looking for a machine of this power.That's all I can think of for now. Great purchase.",0
"(Fast and beautiful screen): I got the 14"" i7 16gb 512ssd and has beautiful screen and super fast. The touchpad is like a smartphone but i just turned it off to use cursor. Downgraded from 90ghtz to 60ghtz for more battery but its still fast and smooth browsing. Overall nice laptop for 1200. I didnt buy for gaming but for my new job as realtor. Office use. Will buy a 27"" display later. Lots of ports to connect anything and has a webcam.",0
(Good value): Good value for money. Had it for some months and I don't have any complaint.,0
"(Good for school etc, bad for gaming.): Great little laptop but not the sturdiest thing in the world, which is expected for the price. Definitely not proficient for any serious gaming but adequate for school, browsing, streaming etc.",0
Watching movies on the full HD screen is as crisp and clear as any glass LCD screen.,0
(Reliable and excellent laptop): Have had zero problems with this laptop.,0
(Fast and good price.): Fast and perfect price for package and products.,0
"(Ordered 3 chromebooks but only two arrived): It is very rare that Amazon could miss an item in a shipment. Order 3 chromebooks but only two were delivered in the box, The shipping label was cut from another box and tapped to the shipping box. BTW Amazon's customer service is quite good. Got refund for the missing chromebook via on-line chat.However, the Chromebook itself is great.",0
"(trust dell): purchase for grandson for school. exceeded all expectations. Chromebook is not designed for gaming, hence no rating entered for that category.",0
"The keyboard on this device has customizable backlighting and macros. It has allowed me to tailor my typing experience to my preferences and needs, meeting the 2018 standard for keyboards.",1
"(Great specs for the price with average build qualith and a poor screen): I own an Asus G20 desktop and Asus PG279Q monitor from their ROG line. Both of which are solid performers - great quality, design, and build. I have also been a Mac user for decades and my go to everyday computer is a MacBook Pro. For work, I have a Lenovo X1 Carbon. All three I have no qualms in terms of what they offer and how they are built.Being a fan of Asus, I had I hopes for this M580VD-EB76 ViVoBook Pro. On paper the specs are top notch:- 2.8GHz Processor (Turbo up to 3.8GHz)- nVidia GTX 1050 graphics processor with 4GB DDR4 RAM- 256GB SATA3 M.2 SSD main hard drive- 1TB HDD secondary hard drive- Harman/Kardon audio- Multiple ports - USB 3.1, USB 3.0, USB 2.0, Headphone/Audio-in combo, HDMI 1.4, SDXC card readerThis is definitely more than a home/work computer as it's capable of avid gaming just short of fully meeting VR gaming specs.PROS:The Harman/Kardon audio is a win. It doesn't replace external speakers, but it's one of the best one's I've heard for one built into a laptop.The Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor doesn't hold back in performance unlike those specifically made for laptops.The nVidia GTX 1050 4GB graphics processor I can't complain although a GTX 1060 would have been ideal to meet VR gaming needs.SATA3 M.2 SSD cards plus additional traditional hard drive combo is the norm these days for primary and secondary storage.The ingenious wired Ethernet port design without having the need to purchase a USB to Ethernet adapter is definitely a great pro feature for this laptop.The keyboard has a great feel to it and is very quiet when typing.CONS:The keyboard feels too crammed I find myself pressing the nearby keys more often. And while the number pad is a good addition, again the crammed keys make me mis-press than what I have intended.The screen is a very poor performer. The colours are washed out and not vibrant. The anti-glare screen is giving me glare that I find myself having to adjust the angle all of the time. I'm definitely not loving the performance of this FHD with a TN panel. I wish Asus went IPS as adjustment from glare and the fact that you have a narrow viewing angle before it gets washed out.All I get is brightness without vibrance.Also the black bars on each side of the screen is too thick it makes this laptop look dated. Asus could have easily shaved an inch in width from this laptop so I wonder why they continued with this design especially having a crammed keyboard when there is still so much width to play around with doesn't make sense. It appears more of a cost issue than to retool their equipment.Opening the lid isn't a smooth feature. Unlike Macs where you can simply lift the lid open, the main body doesn't lift up. With this Asus, you have to hold your hand down on the main body as it will lift up together when opening the lid. Not exactly a good pro design.For a VivoBook Pro notebook, having been provided Windows 10 Home instead of Pro is a big miss.The trackpad isn't also a stellar performer. It's not as sensitive as I am used to from other laptops including MacBooks.Like all manufacturers there are too many bloatware installed. Even after set up, the Asus software gives you a chance to install even more ""recommended"" free software.Finally the metal body feels cheaply made unlike the metal feel of a Mac. With the Asus it feels thin that I have to double guess if it's plastic than aluminum. So while the lid and body are metal, the underbody is disappointingly plastic. The feel is completely different and feels like another shortcut in cost and quality.OVERALLFor what it is and the price, you really can't complain. But for a manufacturer like Asus I would have expected a whole lot more in terms of quality of components and materials as well as design.The box of this laptop bills itself as a VivoBook Pro, but I don't quite see the ""pro"" aspect of it apart from impressive specs on the inside with so-so execution on the outside.",0
(Met our needs): Good little lap top for basic needs,0
"(Excellent price to performance ratio, with a good screen): I just unboxed this laptop today, so keep in mind that this is more of a first impression. This laptop is selling for $1049 on Amazon, but I've seen it selling at $100 more on a major website with only 8GB of Ram, compared to 16GB on this model. The specs on this laptop are great for this price and it is very up to date, sometimes OEMs will put slightly out of date CPU or GPU in their lower end gaming laptop, but everything in here is current generation. You get a fifth generation, H-series Ryzen 7 with a 45 watt TDP paired with a 3050Ti. This is one of the newest in the 30xx series from Nvidia and it's also on the lower end of the spectrum, it only has 4GB of VRAM and it serves as a replacement (hopefully) for the mobile versions of the GTX 1650/1660 cards which are starting to get older and don't support DLSS just like they don't have RT or Tensor cores. You get support for those higher end features with this card. Ray Tracing and DLSS upscaling can really make a huge difference in performance, especially with midrange cards like this one. This 3050Ti is powerful, it's just not up there with the 3070 or 3080. 1080p at 50-60 frames per second is what you should expect from this system, but with DLSS enabled, you can get more. This would be for the newest games at medium ish settings. You have to be careful because the manufacturer chooses to implement a given graphics card at a certain wattage, sometimes less than what is optimal. Lenovo says this 3050Ti has a max TGP of 95 watts, I think they are counting boost to get to this number. Nvidia says that 80 watts is the highest TGP that can be used for the 3050Ti, so you should be able to get all of the performance that this card is capable of, in this Legion 5.This laptop is really heavy, but that's a good thing, especially since this thing is all made from plastic. It means that there is a very substantial cooling system. Lenovo calls it ""Cold Front"" and it's the third generation of that design. You have controls for how loud you want the fan to get, it can get pretty loud when you are playing a game, but you can slow it down if you care more about noise than performance. The port selection is great, you get ports for days with this thing. 4x USB A, 2x USB C, 1x HDMI 2.1, 1x Ethernet, 1x headphone/mic aux, and power. Both USB C ports have support for DisplayPort 1.4, and the one on the back support Power Delivery. You will only want to use that as a fall back, since 100 watts is the maximum USB C Power Delivery is capable of at the moment, and this laptop comes with a 230 watt charging brick.The screen is good and supports lots of newer technologies. It's 165Hz, 100% sRGB, 10 bit color depth with support for Dolby Vision (and G-Sync + FreeSync). The only downside is that it only can go up to 300 nits of brightness, so I don't know how good the HDR content will actually be at that level of brightness. It's fine for standard dynamic range content, though. There are 2x 2 watt speakers and they sound good to me, they are downward firing. This laptop will make a great content consumption device, in addition to being a powerful gaming machine.I really like the keyboard, It's backlit with 4 zones of backlighting. The Lenovo Vantage app lets you save 3 profiles and change the pattern of the RGB lighting. It's great for typing, lots of key travel and keypress that feels satisfying. The trackpad is excellent, I was surprised at how accurate and smooth it was. I usually type my reviews on a Surface Laptop because I think Microsoft has some of the best keyboard/trackpad combos on windows, but I would be okay using this from now on.You can upgrade this laptop too, it comes with a 500GB 2280 NVMe SSD installed, but there is a second unused slot if you want to add more. I'm going to add 500GB more and report back on that. According to the Lenovo website, both slots only support 2242 or 2280 size NVMe drives. There are 2 SO-DIMM slots, each with 8GB installed, I don't know how much can be added successfully. The Lenovo page says that 16GB is the max, but I don't know if that is total or per slot.Performance has been great throughout my testing today, I will have more to say about that when I update this review after a couple of days of gaming on here. Battery life seems a little short, but I got less than 2 hours with the settings turned up as high as I could while playing Control. But it seems to drain quickly when not gaming, at least at maximum brightness.Here are some results from playing Control and messaging around with the settings:Medium/1080p/DLSS off/RT on =22-25 FPSHigh/720p/DLSS on/RT on =60-65 FPSMedium/720p/DLSS off/RT off = 85-90 FPSHigh/720p/DLSS on/Medium RT = 75-80 FPSHigh/1080p/DLSS off/RT off = 35-40 FPSHigh/1080p/DLSS off/RT On= 15-18 FPSYou can see that DLSS upscaling makes a huge difference, and having Ray Tracing is really nice but it can seriously reduce performance. This was while playing connected to power and in performance mode. Pretty good, though.Update: I’m really liking this laptop and it can perform really well to only have 4GB of VRAM. I think it’s up to each individual to determine whether a 1660TI with 6GB of 192 bit GDDR6 (4.884 Teraflops) would be more advantageous to have for their specific needs, compared to 4GB of 128 bit GDDR6 (5.299 Teraflops) on this with the perks of having DLSS, RT, and the latest Ampere architecture. It really comes down to the types of games (or other work) that you intend to do with the machine. This Legion 5 is a really good buy for $1050. I really like the screen too, it's very good for the price considering the specs of this machine. Just don't get your hopes up for the HDR content, 300 nits is not enough to really get the ""wow"" effect that HDR has on 1000 nit TVs.Update 2: Some newer games do not fare so well in my testing. Playing CyberPunk 2077 on patch 1.23 I was only able to achieve 30fps at 1080p with the lowest settings. Forget about Ray Tracing, it will bog you down into the low teens, sometimes dropping below 10fps. You really have to use DLSS to enjoy this game at a playable frame-rate. I was able to get between 45-60fps at medium settings, using the dynamic, automatic DLSS options where it will upsample from as low as 720p depending how many assets are on screen at any given moment. How TF did they (CD Projekt Red) ever expect this game to run on base level consoles (PS4 and Xbox One)???Other games, like ""The Outer Worlds"" run flawlessly on this hardware in Ultra settings at native 1080p, achieving 70-80fps. It just depends on how the game is coded, and how much VRAM is truly needed. I would check the recommended configuration (not the minimum requirement) to see if the games I was most interested in playing are suitable for this hardware. Some people are going to be better off spending the extra money and going up to a 3060 or 3070 GPU if they can afford to.This comes with 3 months of Stadia Pro, Amazon Music Unlimited, and a Dropbox 100GB plan (for whatever that may be worth to you).6 month update: This machine has continued to work well for me, and I still use it regularly for gaming and other tasks. I have not had any issues that required any kind of support. I added a second 500GB NVMe to increase the storage to 1TB, I may double the Ram to 32GB later on. I still think this is a good buy but that is at the $1050-$1100 retail price it was listed when I received it. It’s currently priced in 3060 territory($1500ish) and that GPU is a lot better because the 4GB of VRAM on this 3050Ti does hold you back in the newest AAA single player games. I hope this nightmare ends in 2022 and we see GPUs return to their normal price, this is getting absurd how long this has been going on.",0
"(Doesn’t connect to the Wifi): After initial setup, the machine stopped being able to connect to the internet. Wifi wasn’t even an option anywhere to be found in settings or anywhere. I got a replacement and the same thing happened to the replacement. Nothing was clicked, the awful driver was no where to be found. I do not recommend.",0
"(if you want to watch Netflix, Amazon, Hulu or anything else forget about it.): I bought this product so I could watch movies, and you cant watch anything on it. What a huge mistake buying this piece of junk",0
"(Great for the the Price): I am happy with my purchase it handles the games I play Perfectly. The fan can be load when set at max, but if you are using headphones you won't notice it. After a while I even tone it out. The fans keep it really cool. Getting the back cover off to do upgrades can be a little difficult because of clips that hold it on. The speakers are ok as with the built in web cam. It is best to be plugged in while using the battery only last a couple of hours. Overall For the ram and graphics card it comes with and the price it is worth it.",0
(HP has the best Laptops for the money): I am more than pleased with my new laptop. It was more than I expected in a laptop,0
(Buen precio): Buena lapto a buen precio recomendada para trabajos básicos cumple,0
"(Beautiful Hardware, Full of bloat): 5 stars if Microsoft would quit filling their OS with junk programs from 3rd parties. The hardware is exceptional. From the size, through the feel of the touch-pad, to the screen everything is beautifully crafted.",0
(Slow!): Pretty dang slow,0
"(Just build a PC, don't bother with this): I've had this laptop for a year and a half now. It ran okay until the right side fan suddenly started making this ugly, unbearable grinding/buzzing noise. Right after the warranty expired (of course). Checked for dust and cleaned, tried to adjust the fan speed, nothing helped. The only way to make it stop is to open up the laptop and unplug the fan. Don't waste money on this.",0
"(My only problem......): The only problem i have is the screen. It is a bit dull, but its not a deal breaker. You can adjust it, I've just been too lazy to do so lol.Very nice computer, starts up super fast???What surprised me was it has a FULL sized keyboard. Alexia is a very nice touch. The speakers are surprisingly good. The design is very nice as well. Search youtube and see reviews on it. Thats what I did before I purchased. All good reviews.",0
(My son loves it): I ordered this lab top for my son and loves it. I'm glad because I loved the price. It has all the features the other name brands and more and its much cheaper.,0
"(SUPER STICKY KEYS on keyboard): I've only had this for a month or so and the keys on the keyboard ""stick"" - i.e. i'm constantly making typing errors bc the space bar and shift key is very picky -- you have to hit it exactly the right place. Many of the key require A LOT of effort in your fingers to type correctly. That may be odd feedback but it's driving me mad -- and making my hand and neck hurt a ton too! Ugh. If it was still within the return window, I'd return it. I recommend continuing your search for an economical Chromebook elsewhere.",0
"(Constant BSoDs, ASUS RMA fixed nothing): I bought this laptop for my mother for Christmas 2018. Almost immediately after unboxing it, she started having issues with BSoDs (Blue Screen of Death). After months of me trying to troubleshoot, reinstalling Windows, and her saying ""it's okay I'll only use it for YouTube,"" I finally submitted an RMA with ASUS as it is still under warranty. We send the laptop back and after a week or two they send it to us with a factory image (which is all they did according to the notes) and... it immediately BSoDs the second it's actually in use. Nothing had been installed yet. We turned it on and Windows 10 kicked in its ""critical"" updates and the system BSoDed at that point. Clearly the service center didn't test much. Trying to get ahold of their service department again. Will update this review if the laptop is ever functional.",0
"(Do not order this book- horrible): This horrible, horrible item was shipped to my granddaughter for use in virtually learning. The screen was scratched, and the battery would not charge. The company that sent it contended that the returned item was not the item sent and would return only 50 percent of my almost 700 dollars! For shame!!",0
(Awesome): Awesome piece,0
"(NOT JUST FOR GAMING! [Read about Nahimic Audio interfering with UserBenchmark GPU test]): I bought this laptop for photo/4K video editing and music production. The price for the specs is crazy. If it's good for gaming, it's good for anything else.Likes: POWER. Scores high on benchmarks. Is fast and snappy in real use. I connected it to my 49"" Samsung Q70R and it ran Death Stranding in 4K on max settings at 70 FPS with DLSS set on Performance.Yes, with V-Sync on, smooth 4K60 is possible on this laptop without turning down eye candy if the game supports DLSS. Without DLSS, it obviously becomes a slideshow, since 3840 x 2160 is a crazy resolution for a modern game even with an RTX 2080 Ti. At 1080p with DLSS set on Quality, FPS get as high as 130s.Dislikes: SCREEN. The black levels are abysmal. It's the worst laptop screen I've ever owned. I thought my 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 was bad. The screen is so thin, just touching the lid shifts the black levels to a greenish hue, and positioning it also causes a shift.The colors are nice, though, and in other than dark scenes, it looks decent. It's not very bright, but it's plenty for daylight use with a window behind. Oh, it came with no dead pixels or bright spots, so that's good! Viewing angles aren't impressive, especially for an IPS panel. I'm so unhappy with the screen, I would return the laptop if it wasn't for the high value, for how gorgeous it looks and how compact it is.Keyboard looks better than it feels. Keys are tight, but could use a more clickety feeling. I'm not into the RGB craze, but I have to admit the light show looks beautiful. My favorite config is Roulette. Mentioning RGB, I built a Ryzen 9 3900X system months ago and the CPU came with an RGB fan. I was annoyed by it at first, but once I changed the stock light show, I can now appreciate how my case is accented.If you're anti-RGB like I was, this MSI laptop has some civilized light schemes. It's not retina-burning lighting. Give it a chance.Battery is just OK for portability when using it for normal tasks. You don't get a powerful gaming laptop with a hexacore i7 10750H and full RTX 2070 to play unplugged from the wall. Makes no sense.Build quality and fit and finish is very nice. It's a budget gaming laptop, but this isn't budget-feeling at all. You just get a plastic case, not machined aluminum.Software-wise, it comes with a Norton antivirus trial, which I promptly deleted. All the other apps are non-intrusive. Whatever bloatware it came with doesn't stick out, but I uninstalled them. I also uninstalled all the MSI apps to rule out any potential funky business/performance issues.It's my first MSI laptop and I highly recommend it. I will revise this review if something bad comes up. I enclosed a few benchmark scores. This thing has a lot of power. It could replace a desktop/tower PC.EDIT - The first thing I did with it was download UserBenchmark just to see how it compared to my Acer Predator Helios 300. The speakers would make a loud popping sound on the Sphere GPU test, invalidating the benchmark and not yielding results.That never happened to me before with my other computers, and made me suspect that it was audio-related, so I stopped and disabled the Nahimic service, and also uninstalled the Nahimic app. That solved the issue and I finally got all my scores.",0
"(Great Little Chrome Book): I ordered through Amazon and received it 2 days later. So far, I’m pleased. It synchronized with all of my google stuff. My docs & photos that are on my phone are also on the HP 360 Chrome which is very cool. I did have to power off then back on because my sound cut out . I it was an app notification that started the issue but honestly can’t say. After I restarted the 360 it’s been fine ever since. I basically will be using it to surf the web, produce & save documents, send emails every now and then and stream movies. Having the USB type C ports are like icing on the cake. Already ordered a 10’ type c to HDMI cord to stream movies to the tv in my RV. The touchscreen is great!! I unplugged it from the power for the day to see how long it will last. It’s been over 12 hours and the battery is no where near depleted. I haven’t been on it the whole time but a good amount of the day. Hope this review helps someone.",0
There are stains on the keyboard that is fused into the plastic.,0
(Battery will not hold a charge): I love the easy use of this product and every thing about it. BUT I have only had it 5 months and the battery will not charge.I do not use it on battery very often but even when I use it plugged into electric the battery is not charging. I am very disappointed in this product. I thought it would at least last the year.,0
"(Very good): I bought this laptop for my wife who isn't really an avid gamer but enjoys them from time to time.It runs and performs exactly like how something with these specs should. Runs Sims 4 on high settings easy and fast. And for that, I give it 5 stars.It's always plugged in so I can't vouch for the battery life.The only issue I could see is that the fan can get pretty loud. But that sucker will keep your laptop cool! I would much prefer a loud fan laptop over an overheated laptop. And with laptops, you can only choose one of the two!",0
"(It’s a good price now. I bought it at 879, and I thought still that was a good price.): I like the fps I’m getting and the graphics. I do however dislike the battery life I get around 3-4 hours for battery life. And what I’ve also noticed is, keep your charger plugged in, when my charger wasn’t plugged in, I started to lag a bit and my fps dropped. Overall great product. I bought it at $879. I wish I waited a bit so the price would move dropped ):",0
"(Just don't): I hardly ever write reviews for products, unless they're positive, but I'm here to warn you to STAY AWAY from this laptop. It's super-light and small, which is great if that's what you're after. However, it does not come with a USB-converter, and you will probably need one of those, so if you insist on buying this, make sure you add one of those to your cart.I bought this laptop when my old one stopped working (it was the OG Windows Surface, which for all my complaints lasted five years), so I was in a desperate situation at the time. I read reviews, and purchased the least expensive machine with the best ratings that I could find, and hoped this thing might last a couple of years while I save up for something ideal. But the speakers are already broken, and I've had it for about a month. All the online troubleshooting has failed to fix the problem, which appears to be mechanical. And this laptop hasn't left my desk once since I purchased it.Don't waste your hard-earned money on this laptop. The light weight and the slim profile aren't worth it.",0
(Description is wrong): I bought this laptop for my mother. She has a difficult time seeing the keys so I bought this one since it offers a backlit keyboard. The one I received does NOT have a backlit keyboard. I read another review stating the same issue. Perhaps the vendor should confirm before shipping or change the description.,0
"(Nice): Very nice computer for the price, loving the touch screen.",0
(That it meets my expectations): The chromebook is just what I want. It's great!!,0
"(Touch and Flip Options , YASSS!): I adore it! Love it! My only complaint is that it has a really hard time picking up wifi and has no option for ethernet. The flip screen and touch option is so fun! I love that I can flip the keyboard the opposite way to watch shows or give classes.",0
"(Great for simple tasks): I'm giving this a 5 star because the laptop is perfect for what it is and the seller was great, however I watched multiple YouTube videos glorifying the M1 chip as being fast enough that 8GB could handle a ton of open applications. I need a bunch of tabs open for my work, use Canva constantly, and occasionally need to open Photoshop too so I needed to return this and buy 16GB. But that's my fault and the YouTube reviews faults, not the laptop. Battery life is amaaaazing though!",0
It is fast and the MSI dragon center is very easy and good for monitoring the cpu and gpu.,0
(Good teen laptop): This is not a touchscreen. Otherwise it's great for my 14yr old. He uses it for hw and for playing games...mostly for playing games.,0
"(Not as advertised): This is advertised as a touchscreen, but it did not work. I contacted tech support and was told that there is no touchscreen on this model. The screen was frozen in zoom and after an hour with tech support it was not working. I returned it.",0

(Ok for what I needed it for.): Ok for what I needed it for.,0
"(Not compatible with Microsoft programs and applications): My Windows laptop died and I didnt have time to research too thoroughly. Read the initial reviews, one which name-dropped my beloved long-stolen Acer netbook, and thought this sounded perfect: Portability, long battery, ""zippy"" one reviewer called it. And it was indeed zippy as it fired right up and my fingers adjusted to the soft, compact keyboard. Quickly I realized the problem: Google operating systems are not compatible with Microsoft Programs. yes, there are ""add ins"" like band-aids to access Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Access, etc but I need the ability to work offline and MS Office cannot be downloaded on Chromebook. Two years of projects on Microsoft programs and I couldnt work on them. Other programs I use frequently were incompatible with the OS too. Spent two hours online with tech support but in the end, I had to pack this adorable little netbook back up in the box and return it.",0
(solid gaming laptop for the price): Easy to upgrade. Added another TB of NVME m.2 and 32gb of ram to the base model and it was much cheaper and probably better components. Runs 1080 low to mid in 144 frames in just about everything,0
"(DO NOT BUY ASUS): Within the first six months of receiving the laptop, my graphics card died. It was within warranty, so I sent it to ASUS and they sent it back to me broken for a different reason: the fans no longer recognized what speed they needed to be running at so they just ran on full all the time. Sent it back again and after a month, I finally had a working laptop again. Fast forward to November 2020, a little more than a year after fixing my graphics card, the GC dies AGAIN. This time its out of warranty and ASUS wants me to pay 85 just to send it in and have their team diagnose it. After a month of fighting them on how graphics cards should not be full dying within two years of purchase (multiple times), they let me send it in free of charge. Only now, they're saying its a display problem and not graphics card (had it diagnosed by third party before sending it in case they pulled this) and want to charge me $1500 to repair it. They want $1500 to replace a display thats not broken on a $1800 laptop that I've had less than two years.... And if you couldn't think it gets worse, they're asking for purchase records, all communications made to ASUS (when they're the ones that keep those records?) and photos of the issues I saw. You can't really take a picture of artifacting since it's glitches that happen on screen and last a moment before crashing whatever application you're in. Long story short, they're gaslighting me waiting for me to give up and pay them pretty much all over again for the laptop for an issue that doesn't exist because they don't want to fess up that its my graphics card AGAIN because that would give me too much of a case to have the repair done on them.Update: Have since found out that when companies like ASUS do repairs, they often put refurbished parts into the devices sent in to them and that my IT I worked with before sending ASUS the laptop said they are not surprised the laptop died again because what ASUS did was only a temporary fix, knowing that I would come back later, outside of warranty, and need it repaired at a cost.Do not buy anything associated with this company. They will make you run circles just to get working hardware. Will update once disputing process is complete.",0
(Decent nothing stand out): Decent but nothing great,0
(Runs way to hot): It runs games really good. But if I flip it over I literally can cook eggs on the bottom of it. I’m scared it will break because it is running so hot. Is that normal?,0
"(save your money and buy something decent): Its slow, colors contrast is terrible and if you click on a story and in it is a sidebar, click on that and its impossible to read as the scroll feature is uncontrollable and the drop down ads take forever to download. in some situations the scrol down feature disappears entirely.",0
(Very noice): It works great I love it only reason I put a 4 star is sometimes the a key doesn’t work and sometimes the screen won’t click,0
"(Good laptop): Good laptop, fast delivery. Everything as I wanted. Thank you",0
(not sure why I even bought this...): ...because I hate it.,0
A light machine for its size 17 and excellent value after experience .,0
"(Second times the charm!): I have received my first unit however it does not power on. Asus support advised me to exchange it so I am currently in the process of doing so. The notebook had also clearly been used or at least opened previously as the box was packaged very sloppy and there were smears on the display. Will update once I get a unit that works.UPDATE:Since I originally wrote this review I have been in touch with amazon and it is believed that whoever returned the unit I got the first time did not flag it as defective so the defective unit was sent to me, Luckily amazon has some pretty great customer service and we were able to return my first unit and get the new one with in a week. I have been using the notebook for a few days now and have been enjoying pretty much everything I was looking for in a laptop. However it does lose one star as the fan is rather load even when doing some fairly basic tasks, but I was aware of this before I purchased and I think it is still well worth it, this is the cheapest ultrabook you can find thats below 1000 CAD. I would still highly recommend this if your looking for a thin, light, and well built notebook..",0
(Poor battery life & quiet speakers): Great except the battery life is barely better than my old chromebook and significantly shorter than my dell inspiron and lenovo legion. The speakers are also kind've weak. But otherwise a great laptop for the price.,0
"(New? No it's not.): Seems like a good computer, but it was not a new computer. After a couple weeks of using it Windows appeared to be corrupted. I took it to my favorite computer genius and he found that the original free Windows 10 OS was loaded on it. He said that Windows corrupted itself when it tried to upgrade to the latest version, but couldn't, because it has skipped three releases. So again, he verified that the computer was at least 2 years old when it was sold to me. He was able to load all the releases and get it up to date, hopefully I won't have any more issues with this.",0
"(Dead pixel upon arrival): It seems this is a problem that many people have had in the past, but my machine came with a dead pixel on the screen. Of course I could return it, but as I am currently living in Japan, it would take forever, so I contacted Amazon and they were nice enough to give me a partial refund. This doesn't come with an international warranty (thanks Lenovo), so I would have to pay out of pocket to have it repaired here.Without the dead pixel, this product would definitely get 5 stars. It's fast enough for the photo editing that I do, as well as for playing some games here and there.Update: A dotted bar of pixels has appeared at the bottom of the screen. It's clearly a hardware problem. Not worth buying any more in my opinion.",0
(Dangerous): Started sparking around the power connector about four months after purchase. Called Acer and they sent me a label immediately and I sent it in for repair. They sent it back saying it’s not covered under warranty. I threw it in the trash. Beware.,0
"(Value): Early returns are solid, best price for these specs I could find at OD after searching for a couple weeks post Black Friday. Not the prettiest laptop I’ve ever seen, but not bad and certainly thin/light/fast. No touchscreen was a plus for me",0

(Crashing and horrible service): Machine had a hardware issue and continuously blue-screened. Customer service was miserable and a giant waste of time.,0
"(Paid over $1000 and broke in less than 30 days but won't replace with new one): I bought this computer for my daughter to have a new reliable computer to use at college. We got it the second week of August but didn't set it up until the third week (just in15 time for her start). It worked until Sept 15 and then the hard drive crashed. Even though it worked less than a month, the seller refuses to replace it or do anything -- they referred me to Asus. Asus refuses to replace it -- only refurbish it. If I wanted a refurbished computer, I would have paid several hundred dollars less and bought one. Totally unacceptable quality and total lack of customer service.",0
"(My review on the laptop): It is a very solid gaming laptop, very good thermal, fan is not loud even on turbo, you can turn it to balance or silent mode without heating the laptop. The screen is the best, RGB is great but you can completely turn it off to avoid having that bad gamer impression.",0

"(All the Right Boxes and a Lot of PC for the Money!): All the Right Boxes and a Lot of PC for the Money!UPDATE, I have had this computer for seven months now and its still working perfectly and have also stalled Windows 11 Insider. True its not my main computer for Photoshop but still gets its share of use with no problems.(Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-36UT Slim Laptop | 15.6"" Full HD Display | 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor | 4GB DDR4 | 128GB NVMe SSD | WiFi 6 | Amazon Alexa | Windows 10 Home (S Mode)For a computer of this size and configuration it is an amazing unit with speed and versatility I would not have expected. Topping that off is a second drive bay which will take a HDD or SSD drive up to 2Tb and even upgrade the existing 128 GB M2 can be swapped out for larger main C Drive. It also has a slot to add another stick of ram. As a 15 inch the computer is quite light and thin making it easy to carry around. There are four USB (one USB C, one USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0) along with a HDMA and headphone outputs. And of course its got Alexa!With an Intel I3 running at over four GHz it is very fast and booting up I clocked at 12.5 seconds after a five second hold on the start button. I do photoshop and video so made a test comparing it with my main work computer to render a 25 image 2.55 minute video slideshow with music with all images in the 10 to 20 MB range. My bench mark has Intel I5 and a dedicated Gforce graphic processor.Results: my benchmark rendered the video in 59.8 seconds. This Acer came in very well at 1:16.3 minute which is remarkable considering the price difference of my benchmark. Doing light to medium video and photo touch up this will be more than up to the task.One important thing to note is that this comes set up in Windows 10 “S” mode which can be changed. S mode is set up as a more secure PC by limiting all apps to what is in the Microsoft Store. What this means is you are locked in to the EDGE browser, non Microsoft photo editors or music players for example. If you are good with that then leave it as is.If not, it is an easy change to turn it into a full fledged Windows 10 PC and takes only a couple minutes BUT when you do that you will not be able to go back to S mode. Just search Microsoft S mode and a link will tell you how to turn off S.",0
"(Very robust equipment!): I was an heavy user of a 2015 12 inches Macbook. That's one of the best computer in the world. Every job coleague bought one after the experience on my Mac.I can't put 5 stars o the new M2 Air model. It's heavier and bigger than my original Mac. And it appears like a conventional laptop. But the main problem is the time life of Apple products in general. I have an older Dell notebook in my office and it has no problems with recent Windows version. Apple doesn't support their products more than seven or eight years. It's impossible or very expansive to replace battery or to fix keyboard.In the end of the day, the initial low investment will increase because you must replace your Mac sooner than other Windows equipment.I'm considering to give up from Apple after this M2. I'm using a Samsung tablet and it has a longer life than Ipad. The same happens to my cell phone. But I'll miss the Mac robustness against virus: if something appear (rarely) you only need to reboot the Mac.",0

"(Good for the price, with some issues.): I got the 12UGKV-464 version, which is the i7-12700H with the RTX 3070.Pros:Very fast, runs new games at Ultra with no problemStyling, i like it but that's subjectiveCompact for a laptop with this performanceBang for buck, if you grab it on sale, it's worth the amount of performance you can get for a laptop at this price point compared to its competitorsCons:Screen color is awful (I've spent hours in the app trying to correct it but it is just bad)Runs HOT, even with the fan on max, I've seen the CPU jump above 90c many times.Storage, it comes with a 512gb drive, which with windows leaves you with not much room. This version only has one extra m2 slot and no 2.5"" slot. Also, adding another drive requires you to open to laptop, breaking the seal and voiding your warranty.Battery life, I brought this to a meeting at work once instead of my smaller chromebook. Even on 'super battery mode', only running MS Word, the battery didn't survive the 1.5 hour meeting. It's technically a laptop but don't expect to be able to use it not plugged in for any amount of time.Overall, I'd give it a 4/5.The performance of this thing is great, I've tried many new games with it and it's performed very well.The cooling issues are very concerning, as this can seriously shorten the lifespan of the CPU (the GPU doesn't seem to have the same issues). The heat, lack of expandable storage, nonexistant battery life, and the screen coloration are holding this back from being a 5/5 for me. If you are going to use this primarily at home, somewhere it can be kept well ventilated, connected to an external monitor and occasionally bring it out, I'd suggest it.",0
(Five Stars): Great...,0
display is very phenomenal.,0
(Incorrect information): The specifications state a 1 TB Hard disk drive. It automatically downloaded Windows 11 S but it stated that it was a Windows 10 OS.,0
software-preload came in an abysmal state,0
(Lovely): Great,0
(Simple computer): Got this for the mobility and it’s very effective just for that and multitasking.,0
"(The hinge is not durable): The hinge is not durable and comes off. When this happens, it loosens up the frame around the screen. Then you find it difficult to open or close the lid. Lenovo warranty specifically doesn't cover issues like that even if happens after 3-4 months.",0
no easy access to the SSD or RAM,0
(Toy): It's a toy,0
"(Perfect for a creator - a lot of hardware for the money!): I got this exact configuration directly from D e|| (Core i9 12800H, RTX 3070 Ti, 32GB RAM), and thought I'd share impressions here.As a creator (and not a gamer), I do video and photo editing on this machine, mostly connected to an external monitor and plugged into wall power. In this context, this machine with its specs is probably the best value of 2022 from a major brand name that is broadly available online.You can find various online reviews of this machine (or its closely-related 2022 G15 relative), so I won't rehash anything really here. But I would just offer these salient points that aren't immediately obvious in some reviews:The (major) high's for me:(1) The CPU and GPU are allowed to run high in their power thermal envelopes, so you're getting a lot of performance for this combination of hardware.(2) The 2022 G16 has a 16:10 screen, which is superior for creation and productivity versus the 2022 G15's 16:9.(3) The included 2x16GB DDR5 RAM sit in two slots that are user-upgradeable to 2x32GB when I'm ready.The (minor) low's for me:(1) The single USB-C Thunderbolt port does not support Power Delivery, so you're stuck using the included brick and barrel power jack for power.(2) There is no connector on the motherboard for a second M.2 PCIe SDD. They seemingly removed this capability in 2022, though the 2021 G15 did have this.(3) The trackpad is laughingly small given how big this laptop is. They could have pushed the keyboard higher on the deck to make more room below the keyboard for a bigger trackpad.(5) When using high performance settings, unsurprisingly, the fans sound like a passenger jet taking off.(6) The included Dell and Alienware configuration software are unsurprisingly slightly buggy. For example, settings don't always ""stick""; the laptop charges up to 100% even when I set it to stop charging, say, 80%; and pressing keyboard backlight button sometimes doesn't do anything until I load up the Alienware config software again.In my view, the high's far and away outweigh the (minor) low's, especially for how I use the machine.",0
the keyboard is super easy to get used to and works very well!,0
"(Sucks for Zoom): okay so this computer is only good for browsing the internet and watching YouTube. DO NOT get this for zoom though. My friends and I got this computer for school and we all had the problem that during our online classes the computer would start freezing and say ""high CPU usage"". Happens every single meeting to every single one of us. Honestly a waste if you are using this for zoom or any live lecture but it's okay otherwise.",0
"(Over all a great laptop!): I've had this laptop over a year now, and I'm still just in love as the day it arrived! The only slight complaint (If you can even call it that.) Is the battery life is extremely short. BUT. With something so powerful I didn't really expect anything less. I don't see this as something to complain about. I've had it last an hour just listening to music and playing non intensive games, but it's been shorter if I'm playing an intense game or working.Now, on to what really matters. The good. Over all I can't recommend this more. It's worth the money. Easily the best laptop I've owned out of the many I've gone through!- Keyboard is durable, and the back light can be dimmed, or shut off if you prefer. Color cannot be changed.- I've never had any problem with playing games. I have yet to encounter anything that doesn't run properly, or gives a lot of lag or stutter (GTA 5, fallout 4, fortnite, etc.) Even older games like TF2 and star wars battlefront 2 play flawlessly, which sometimes don't go well with newer hardware. Anime games will default to dedicated graphics, so just be sure to change which card they run off of, or it'll be hellish to try to play them.- I've had no hardware issues, this laptop will make using anything without an SSD feel really slow and sluggish in comparison. Nothing's broken and the case is extremely sturdy even after a hard fall onto a wooden floor.- Overheat isn't much of an issue, I did buy a cooling pad just to be safe, but with the push of a button you can make your fans work harder, this will keep it at a nice temp while gaming or working with no worries about the damage that over heating can do!- Not just for gaming either, all my work (Art related, mostly) runs flawlessly, it can run art programs, and game creation software without lag, or stutter. I can run multiple programs at once with no issues. You can run multiple instances of art programs, or have many tabs open without worrying about anything.- There's no scratches, but touching it will leave little 'oily' spots that need to be wiped up. Doesn't happen with the keyboard or track pad but with the casing.- You do have the option to turn off the track pad, speaking of which. I've bought a few laptops now that just simply don't allow this option. It's something I care about as I prefer to use a USB mouse, figure others might as well.-Only has 3 USB ports, but you can use an add on that allows more plug ins.- The built in mic is crisp and clear.",0
"(not happy at all!!!): Ever since I got computer I have had a few issues. The hard drive is extremely noisy, louder than what it should be. The pad for moving the cursor around does not work worth a darn.I have contacted customer service and they have failed to respond. The HP computer I had was replaced because it was running slow, not opening up sometimes, and just getting old.The ideapad 330 that I bought run slower than the six-year-old HP that I had.They have said all along that if there were issues to please contact customer service, which I have done and have not heard anything from them since I started trying to get in touch with them in September.Of course now the 30 day warranty is gone and I will probably end up having to take this in and have somebody work on it to find out what the issue is with the hard drive. They will most likely have to fix a finger pad for moving the cursor around.This is a great product to be don't mind spending money on something that is supposed to be working, henceforth, not real happy.Since I first wrote this review, I have tried to contact the company on several occasions. I have been unable to reach tech support through their recommended process comma email.I will end up taking this piece of junk in to get it fixed.",0
This computer is very fast and runs anything I throw at it with exceptional performance,0
(Best gaming machine): A perfect gift to teenager who into gaming. I use it as my work machine for sometime and work just great. Very responsive and fancy light on keyboard,0
"(One issue after another...): Mouse pad was wiggly and made annoying noise as I went over certain part of it and keyboard felt cheap. Not a very solid feeling machine. Also, a few days after having it, as I would start the machine, it would tell me that there is no hard drive installed. Also saw occasional flickering of the screen. Returned to Amazon. Do not recommend. Not the first bad experience with Dell laptops.",0
(Good value): Good value for the money. Good improvement from my old one to new one. Drastically improved speed. Web browsing and streaming is seamless,0
"(Awesome little workhorse.): I've had this computer for nearly a year, and it does exactly what I need. I love using the Chrome platform!",0
"(Good laptop, bad case.): I read some sterling reviews of people wondering why anybody would not like this computer. I'll tell you why. I've owned Acer and Asis and both cases have failed. Look it up. The hinges on the top fail - one at a time - until soon you're propping the screen against whatever and can't take it anywhere. The case is simply not built to last. It' OK for most projects, but it will fail. Go on Google and see for yourself. There's plenty of advice on how to fix it and none of them work. I had some some success early on taping it all together with electrical tape but that failed too. Now it's propped up against my printer and I can't close the top. At all. Also, be prepared to buy a power cord once a month.",0
"(Worked fine ,for streaming on the web mostly!,.): OhWell to be honest my kitty sabatogged it byPeeing on it .Was one jealous kitty cat .Dam ,oh well !That's how I'm ending my review",0
"(Exactly what I wanted): I'm extremely happy with this device. I love having an SSD because it just runs so fast and quiet. At $400, it's a great model. Some people have complained about the screen brightness, but at least for me, it's not at all an issue.Note that I just wanted a basic model to run with Linux, and it works great right out of the box (no wifi issues, recognizes backlit keyboard, every peripheral works). You'll want to turn off secure boot and change SATA to AHCI, and you'll want to optimize Linux for an SSD drive. It's a great Linux machine.",0
"(Broken Hinge): I cannot recommend you purchase this model. My left hinge froze after 3 years, breaking the cover and the screen. Do your homework. There are many others who have experienced this failure. Samsung blames users. Very expensive to repair, and repairs put the same old hinge design back in place.Other than this, I had no other issues.R",0
It would have been ergonomically nice to have had the flexibility to plug in either the Left or Right side for charging.,0
A laptop equipped with a biometric security system that can identify users before granting access to sensitive data would be a significant enhancement to security measures. This feature would not only provide an additional layer of protection but also personalize the user experience.,1
I only have one negative thing to say so far and that is that it is a fingerprint magnet.,0
(Satisfied with this laptop): Great screen，great quality，battery life not too good,0
this was a very fast delivery,0
(The beast at its best): The lap is awesome to give 5 star. But the heating issue just like other gaming laptop's are present here but i didn't face any thermal throttling or something wish it was much better,0
"(Nice size and weight): Gift to my wife. She enjoys the size and weight, takes it with her often.",0
(Three Stars): Not what I expected.,0
"it stopped charging, to make matters worse the charger got stuck in the charging port and broke off.",0
"(It does NOT have a ssd hard drive as advertised): I chose this chrome book because it is advertised as coming with an ssd hard drive. It does not, it has a eMMC hard drive. I am charging it now and have not used it yet, so I have no idea how well it will perform, but I am greatly disappointed that once again Amazon has misrepresented a product",0
(Very bad battery): The battery holds a charge of only 1.5 hours while watching a video. Slows down very often buggy during robots in Photoshop.,0
(Xmas Gift): Gift no complaints,0
"(Reliability): Slow, unreliable, not good for video conferences.",0
"(A Very Premium Feeling Product): 3DMark Fire Strike: 12907The Razer Blade feels premium. From the CNC aluminum body to the impressive specs to its striking design that fits between ""business"" and ""gamer"", you can tell a lot of time and love went into this product.One concern I did have was the smudging, this machine can smudge very easily, though they were kind enough to include a microfiber cloth to help deal with that. The price is also much higher than its competitors, but you do get a premium feeling product where other product cut corners by using plastics and multiple components. There's also the issue of the RGB afterglow, if you glaze your eyes on the keyboard, you can see the red/green/blue LEDs ever so slightly. The individually lit keys do mean that games like Overwatch and Divinity Original Sin 2 can do things like highlight controls or fade in slowly as a spell waits to be usable again.",0
"(Good for price): Good laptop for the price., I was surprised. Touch screen works well. Great for someone wanting to browse the internet, email and play a few games. Easy to use and set up.",0
(Good Gaming laptop / poor battery life): This laptop runs very well the last PC games but the battery life has a poor performance.,0
(Size weight and dependable): Awesome thank you,0
"(Defective. Keeps crashing with a pink screen.): This review is for a brand new Apple MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 processor. I got it here on Amazon for $200 less than what they sell for on Apple’s website. I bought it to replace my 10 year old MacBook Pro that has performed flawlessly. Unfortunately this new MacBook Air was defective from the start. It would crash frequently with this weird pink screen of death. It would come back up with a MacOS kernel panic log. I would also get the spinning beach ball. And it would randomly reboot itself, even when I wasn’t using it. We can only speculate on why this MacBook Air was such a good deal. Returning it for a refund was not easy and required a phone call to Amazon then a scheduled pickup from my home with an adult.",0
(Gamin quality and fps is through the roof): Most games look like irl and have a very great frame rate speed. Not all game need turbo or extreme mode to run flawlessly which is nice.,0

(Great so far!): Exactly what I needed. I’ve had this computer for a few months and it works great.,0

Computer response is fast and snappy,0
"(Great hardware horrible bios): okay first off love the laptop....except for one fatal flaw. For almost a year now I have had day one boot loops. Levnovo even went as far as to replace the mainboard to try and fix the issue. That still did not fix the boot loop. I have been all over the lenovo forums and looks like I am far from the first person to notice this issue. I have been back and forth over and over again with lenovo support for an update to the bios to address the issue. Why the bios? Because after much research and testing I have narrowed the issue down to the TPM chip and how it interacts with the bios. How do we fix the boot loop issue EVERY reboot? A simple fix to the call function of the TPM in the bios. I could have fixed the issue myself but I am waiting til the laptop is out of warranty before I tamper with the bios file. I would just refund the unit for this problem but the issue would not be resolved and having to give up a perfectly good thin and light would suck. Since it is like pulling teeth from a gator to get support to even acknowledge the issue effects a large percentage of their units, This will in fact be the last lenovo unit I ever buy. Just as I have given up on Asus products as well. My clients follow my recommendations when it comes to reliable hardware therefor im sorry to say after 20 plus years recommending lenovo to my corporate and small business clients they too will be added to the list of products to stay away from.",0
"(The machine is good but it's NOT a 2in1 mode): Hi,The machine is good but it's NOT a 2in1 mode. So you can not use it as a tablet.",0
(Dell XPS 9370 experience): It has been a great experience in size & performance.,0
"(Great for browsing the internet): I like this laptop, and am using it primarily as my portal to the internet. There have been a couple of things that seem to not be available to chrome. The Arduino IDE is available for a monthly fee. As a do over, I might choose a Windows laptop instead.",0
I Wish it came with upgrade options such as 1TB SSD and 32gb ram,0
"(Love Chromebooks, but HP 14- quality/reliability has been terrible): I'm a huge fan of Chromebooks, and I've had great luck with Acer and Samsung models, but the quality of the HP Chromebook 14 series is seriously lacking. I've bought two HP 14- series Chromebooks, and both failed after 12-14 months, just after the warranty expired. On the first model, the keyboard developed problems, with the 6-7-y-u-h-j-n-m not working. I tried re-seating the keyboard ribbon cable, but it didn't help. Hard to use the laptop with eight keys not working. The second HP 14- Chromebook is a model with a fan, and the fan started making hideous noises (like it has bad bearings) just after a year. The noise is so bad the laptop is unusable. Both models were used mostly at my desk and rarely traveled, so the failures can't be blamed on hard lives. I don't know whether HP has fixed its quality problems with the 2016 models, but the 2014 and 2015 models didn't last. Chromebooks are pretty cheap, but if you have to replace one every 12-14 months it's not such a good deal. Personally, I'm avoiding HP Chromebook's, especially the 14- series, until I see evidence that HP has solved its quality/reliability problems.",0
"(Nice little laptops): These little Chromebooks are pretty nice for the money, but they have less customization than a Windows computer. However, Linux apps are allowed (IF your Chromebook has the memory for all the downloads). These dont allow everything to be saved and/or loaded from an SD card, so memory can become an annoying issue.All-in-all I love my little Chromebook. I use it all the time for college and to play music. The blutooth works perfectly and connects right to my phone. There are some features that need to be added, and from what I hear they will add more flexability in future updates. The battery life is a nice plus as well",0
"The refresh rate is superb, and the HD graphics are wonderful.",0
"(Incredible value): When some companies are charging thousands upon thousands of dollars for a functional lightweight laptop, Im not sure how this product cannot impress you. Does what I need it to and screen has decent fidelity.",0
"The computer is also heavier than my old computer which is weird because according to what is on here, it should be lighter.",0
"(Decent laptop but overheats): Decent computer, I had the i7-12650H with GTX 3060 model. Computer overheats so much even just idling. It got to the point where any sort of heavy load made it inoperable. I had to buy a separate cooling pad just to use the laptop so now I have to carry that thing along as well. Also only have has 500 GB of storage which filled up after 4 games but it’s to be expected (upgradable though).",0
"(Nice weight, but the power isn't there.): As a hobby, I like to manipulate photographs. This is only slightly intensive. I use Adobe Photoshop and find that anything I do that requires a little processing, slows to a crawl. Sometimes the program even freezes. The laptop tends to get heated up quickly",0
"(Buen pc, tiene horas e inicios en el SSD pero es aceptable, el equipo se comporta muy bien): Buen pc, tiene horas e inicios en el SSD pero es aceptable, el equipo se comporta muy bien",0
"(A decent little chromebook): Nothing super impressive & certainly not for gaming or anything, but for light activities like browsing the internet or watching something on Netflix, it gets the job done",0

"(Desapointed. Bad product description 😓): Me gusta ASUS, mi esposo tiene una. Pero según la descripción del producto en Amazon dice: Procesador ‎3.4 GHz. Pero no es verdad, realmente es de 1.20 GHz, como muestra la foto. No me fue posible devolverla ya que estoy en otro país.",0
(Super Glitchy): I have had this laptop for about 4 months and its extremely glitchy. The mouse pad works sporadically. The fingerprint sensor is crap and it takes very long for the computer to boot up. I have had an asus before this as well and I loved that laptop but this one blows.,0
(Serves its purpose): Nice. serves its purpose,0

"(DO NOT PURCHASE): If I could rate this Laptop with a Zero rating I would. I Purchased this Laptop in January 2019. Laptop stopped working last week. Computer lasted 5 months. While using computer, screen turned white with a large black spot appearing at the the bottom right of the screen. Screen then turned black. Discovered that computer was under a 1 year warranty from Acer. Contacted Acer after instructions to Refresh Computer which did not solve the problem, informed by Acer Rep that I would have to send Laptop to their company for repair at my own cost. UPS charges $49.00 to ship Laptop to Texas. I refused to pay that amount of money. Contacted Acer and informed them of UPS charges and that I would not be paying that amount of money to return the Laptop which was purchased New. I was then told that since it was the first time that I was returning a computer they would send me a FedEx label so I would not have any out of pocket expenses. After sending the computer to their Repair Center by FedEx, I was informed that my computer has a cracked screen which is not covered under their warranty. I requested that the Laptop be returned to me, I am not paying Acer extra money to fix the screen. This Laptop was not dropped or fell at any time in the 5 months that I had it, it was not purchased as a Refurbished Computer. I am now out $211 which is the price that I paid for it and it did not even last a year.",0
"(Buena laptop,pero su relación calidad-precio está mala.): Recién me acabo de comprar esta laptop, y está buena para lo que ofrece, y como lo que yo busco es trabajar en ella y jugar uno que otro juego ligero me parece buena.

(Great Laptop): Very powerful. And great everything.,0
"(Good Laptop): Good Laptop for the price, There is no Active Pen Support. My only real complaint is the Wifi/Bluetooth Card that comes with it has dismal performance, low connection speeds and dropped packets. I highly recommend anyone buying this laptop to replace the WiFi/Bluetooth card with an Intel Wireless-Ac 9260, 2230, 2X2 Ac+Bt, Gigabit, No Vpro Card. for around $14. Night and day difference!",0
Acer has good build quality and a solid feel,0
"(Happy with the purchase ^-^): I'm very pleased with this laptop! It runs very smooth and the screen looks great.

I onlyhave two recommendations, adding a micro SD card(I used a 128GB, roughly $22, works great) and if you plan on downloading apps that are NOT from the Microsoft store then take the laptop out of S Mode, you will see what I mean! But besides that, The design is slim and sleek, fits perfect inside of a bookbag. The battery life is amazing, screen and sound quality is very clear and clean as well!

(Dead at 6 months): Dead 6months later. Do not buy this laptop if you want it to last more than a year. I actually own two of these. One that I bought from target in 2018. This one died 1 month ago after I had purchased the second one from amazon. I had assumed my amazon purchase was a new unit. But checking the serial number now to make a warranty claim revealed it was also a 2018 unit. So two of these computers died at just shy of 2 years of life. Not a well made or reliable product. I’m extremely annoyed about my second purchase that resulted in only 6 months of use time. Do Not Buy this!!!,0

No problems at all, except for when I couldn't get the keyboard backlight to work which turned out to just be a new driver I had to download. It works fast and and the SSD is worth the extra money because of how quick the computer starts up. Solid buy, and perfect Mac alternative for anyone who is looking for something cheaper!",0
"(An overall okay laptop for the price but the processor is really slow): Need alot of patience for the processor speed. The laptop overall for the price and look is okay but dissapointed in terms of processor - I did not know Celeron proccessors were that slow.

"(Far slower than expected): I just do not understand how a person can keep using this computer. After having multiple chromebooks, i went into this with an expectation, and it fell very low. It's not the worst computer in the world or anything, but it is exceedingly slow, and I can not stand it. I literally counted 10 seconds before it registered that I pressed cut on a highlighted string of text and for a computer I use primarily for google docs, this is unacceptable. Deeply disappointed and I intend to return ASAP.",0
(Great): Nice,0
"(Great but Battery life not so good): I recently purchased this product as I needed a multi-use, lightweight laptop for school and editing. Most features works great. I can open large files on adobe sites without having much lag and the laptop is light and the keyboard is nice to type on. I brought this into school a few times and there were days where it would not last me the whole school day. It was advertised saying it had a long lasting battery life so I expected it to last at least 6 hours but it died after just 5 hours. As long as you’re fine with bringing a charger when staying somewhere for long periods of time, this laptop for its price range is great. If you prefer to not do that I’d say go for something else.Edit: it’s been a few months now since I’ve had the laptop and the keys on the keyboard progressively stopped working. At first I was able to get by by using a different keyboard through Bluetooth but now the on key stopped working and I cant turn my laptop on at all.",0
"(Greatest Budget Gaming Laptop!!): Honestly this laptop does me wonders. I play all of my games very smoothly and I only got this laptop for $900. The keyboard feels great, the backlit keyboard is awesome. Fast start up with windows being on the SSD while I could install my games on the hybrid disc. Honestly, if you're looking to buy a laptop well under $1000, this is a pretty good choice. If you want to upgrade to 16GB of RAM, you could do it easy.",0
"(Great performance, minor issues): Runs quality games. Two issues I have been having: 1. keys getting stuck (mostly number keys) and 2. fan occasionally gets rather loud. Neither is a serious hindrance- the fan is not so loud that it interferes with chatting over a mike or anything like that. The stuck keys just sometimes require you to press down again with a little gentle assistance.I've seen at least one customer noting similar issues, so it's probably a consistent design flaw.The high quality graphics are amazing, and the 4.1 Ghz processor is a treat as well.",0
"(No good): I've had this for a few months now and I'm quite disappointed. I should have known better then to post a review before we really got down and dirty with the lap top. The lap top is extremely slow while surfing the internet or streaming videos or what not, whether working on the wifi or hardwired to the router. I have tried to adjust the wifi range and strength as well as increase the speed. I have reached out to many groups for support and haven't been able to make it faster, my 5 year old Toshiba is a better unit then this one. The shame of it is I purchased this because it got good reviews online, guess I have to reevaluate what I believe in the future. Moral of the story is you get what you pay for and I certainly did.",0
"(Keyboard got crazy): After a month of usage, the keyboard does not respond accurately, it repeats different keys and numbers. The delete key sometimes work sometimes it does not. I tried refreshing and it did not work. I had to send it get checked to see what the problem is. I think is hardware. Bad luck! If you can, pay international warranty coverage.",0
(Samsung Chrome Book): I bought this to take on a trip because it was small. If i knew what i know now i would of bought a more expensive one that performs better.,0
notice the mouse pad has a few issue dragging in the top right and lower left corners,0
(Love it): I love it. Exactly what I ordered. All my expectations were met and more.,0
"(Acer Rules!): Acer Chromebook is beautiful to the touch. Performance is amazing, graphics and memory in abundance. Very happy with this purchase on behalf of my daughter for school!",0
I love the design and materials and handling,0
"(Love Has Departed!!): When I first got this ChromeBook, I was thrilled!! It did everything I needed it to do BUT the last 3 weeks, its been harder and harder to get a full charge. This last week, the unit doesn't even power on despite being plugged in. Guess ya get what ya pay for right!!! Not very happy with this purchase.. If the seller sees this, I'm asking that they contact me. I'd like to see about repairs or if it would be cheaper to simply buy a new Chromebook. BTW, I did love this until I started having problems.",0
(Great gaming laptop): Works great and provides more than enough performance. Battery life is limited when running demanding applications but I'm typically near a power source so this isn't much of an issue for me.,0
(Very adequate): Good value for price,0
"(Love this laptop): I'm an IT guy so having a machine that is powerful but agile is important to me. I upped the RAM to 32Gb of DDR4-2933. Since it does not do XMP, DDR4-3200 will not run full speed. But that's OK by me, it performs great. I'm glad I waited for the Windows Hello camera built-in. Make sure you have USB-C devices or adapters for other peripherals. It does come with one adapter also. You won't go wrong with this laptop.",0
"(Asus vivobook S510UA - So far so good!): Bought this laptop after doing many hours of research.... So far I love it!Pros:Super fast boot time.Very little bloatware.Upgradeable Ram.Additional hard drive slot (I got the 250gb ssd version and will probably add a 1tb hdd)While running multiple Google Chrome tabs, watching a video on YouTube, and running a full anti-virus scan the laptop was still silent (fans weren't even noticeable).Laptop stays cool on your lap.Keyboard is quiet.Laptop is super thin and light weight which makes if very portable.Cons:Display isn't that great (this is something I didn't really care about). For $620 you probably won't be able to find any laptop with these specs and a great display. There's always going to be a tradeoff. I chose to downgrade on the display and processor (i got the 8th gen i5 version which is more than enough power for me).Webcam kind of sucks - This is something I really don't care about since I'll probably never use it.Keyboard flex - Almost all ASUS laptops have a little keyboard flex and it was the main thing that scared me about buying this laptop. After using the laptop for a few days, I can officially say that I'm not even bothered by it. It's very comfortable to type with!No numeric keypad - Again something I didn't really care about.Not sure about battery life yet but I'm thinking you can get 6-8 hours out of this thing if you fool around with some settings. This wasn't a big deal to me since I'm always a few feet away from an outlet if I need a charge.Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase! There's so many laptops out there and almost all of them have mixed reviews (which makes it incredibly difficult to pick one).I'll give a 1 month, 6 month, and 1 year update (if I can remember to do so)",0
(Just Like New): The unit delivered is like new. No damage and it powered up quickly. I did make a few changes to beef it up. Added more memory and installed an SSD drive. Very happy with the results,0
"(Great laptop......): Nice laptop for the price(598$ at time of purchase) & you wont get nothing even close to this price range.Great cpu,8gb of ram(could have 16 but its no problem you can always upgrade),256gb ssd,great display,very thin & light weight.......great laptop overall(only downside is graphics card but for this price you cant get anything better).If youre looking for gaming laptop look elsewhere.Will update on 3,6 months & 1 year if I don't forget it.",0
(Solid Acer laptop): Very solid and robust laptop!,0
(Great laptop): Laptop exceeds my expectations for a laptop. It runs every program that i need it to and start up is fast.,0
(Great for the price!): Love it!,0
(Dont buy this laptop): No touch screen. No batter life. Also 'non genuine' copy of windows on the computer.... In order to have actual windows 10 it will cost 200 dollars from the Microsoft store to get a product key. Never buy refurbished from amazon again. I instantly regret it.,0
(Not bad for the price): Overall the laptop is a decent buy for the price. I threw in a 2TB SSD and it is good to go. So far it is running games and apps with no problems. The main issues I have with it is that it feels super cheap to me. It the corners are sharp and almost scratch you if you rub your hands over them. The screen also has some bleeding on in a few spots on the top boarder. These are not deal breaking issues but I am concerned that taking it to work everyday it might become an issue since it feels like it could break at any time.,0
(Good product): Bought this laptop for my mother and she loves it. It’s thin and perfect size for plane rides and traveling transportations. Also the screen display is great. Not a touch screen laptop which is a plus for her. Good laptop!,0
"(Very high performing true 144hz laptop- model PH317-53-71D6): So I’m not sure what other late top reviews are getting mixed up but if you are looking for a review on the PH317-53-71D6 then read below:Monitor- it is in fact 144hz (tested on ufotest webpage)Bluetooth- obviously it does have BluetoothBattery life- acceptable at around 3-4 hours but it will by default lower the GPU power when on battery- this is configurablePerformance- I’ve played a lot of games on highest settings and it’s maintained a consistent 100 FPS on a few and higher on others. Optimal performance for the price.Why 4/5? The trackpad is a pain but only really used for basic use and not for gaming. Every now and then the cursor lags. Also, temps can get high on high performance games so I’d suggest enabling turbo on the fan.Overall- highly recommend!",0
"(Laptop turns off automatically): So, I bought this laptop a month ago. Overall, I liked the laptop. The screen was just good enough, the keyboard felt good, the biometrics worked well and the trackpad also worked well except with some minor scrolling issues here and there. But, the problem however is that the laptop turns off automatically from time to time. It is so annoying. However, it turned on everytime it automatically turned off.But, just yesterday(10/19/2018), it turned off and hasn't turned on yet and I had so many of my files saved on that laptop. The customer service told me to try different things, none of which worked. The best thing to do was remove the battery and plug it in again and I did not want to risk doing that. So, I just returned the laptop with full refund since it had not been a month. I liked the laptop so I might buy it again, but it is at a higher price now, and I have to go through the hassle of waiting for the new laptop again for a couple of days and setting it up again and praying it does not die on me again. So, it is a good laptop but certainly not a trustworthy laptop.",0
"(Buena funcionalidad): Realmente me encanta, es muy práctica y sirve demasiado bien, además de que es amigable y totalmente fluida, eso sí, cuando llega siempre lo hará con todo en inglés, pero quitando ese detalle que se puede solucionar es una laptop perfecta.",0
They keys are also individually mappable,0
"(Most affordable gaming laptop with RTX3070): Pretty much a very good gaming laptop right out of the box, it comes with 2 stick of 8 GB ram, so didn't even need to update the memory there.Although it is expected that the laptop 3070 variant is not as powerful as the desktop version, it is still very capable at 1080P even ultra /highest setting at any aaa titles, and since the HDMI is not 2.1 (which i would not expect to have on this price point), the max output is 4K 60Hz, i think the 3070 and i7-11800 is a very good combo for that.",0
"(Best choice): Highy recomended, lightweight, portable, easy to carry",0
"(the worst laptop ever): i bought the laptop on 12/22. set it up on 12/28. returning it same day. Literally the worst laptop ever. stick to name brands, its worth the extra money. processor is super slow, required 10+ window updates upon 1st set up which took more than 4 hours. 3 calls to tech support (very helpful btw). don't buy it.",0
"(Something Fishy): Wanted to upgrade from previous version after donating the old one to my younger brother. Went with the 4gb version with dual cores. DOA in an very odd way. Whoever logs into a Chromebook first it recognizes as its owner. Well the first account to log in works for about 120 seconds then starts flashing screen off and on before rebooting and bringing you to log in screen. Add new user, works perfectly fine. Quite snappy and brilliant display. Try to go back to owner log in and you get instant screen blink in and out, 4 - 6 cycles and then reboot and log in screen.I thought it was a glitch in the Google settings so we tried multiple accounts logging in first and same thing everytime. Powerwashing unit by secondary user and trying again. I have a family of 5 and I know everyones log in information so i tried them all. Every user after the first would wotk fine, first on the machine and it is utteraly un-usable.I gave it 2 stars because a D.O.A. computer is not unheard of but this is clearly not shipping damage. Something in the build is wrong.Went to the ACER for a little more but I am not happy to have to give up the Micro SD Slot this one has. That is the reason it did not get 1 star.",0
"(Did NOT have all the features I wanted): so we had to return it.... it was returned without difficulties. It had no drive to install programs, no ethernet jack for wired internet/network use. Logging on required a Microsoft account. All these contributed to the necessity of returning it.",0
"(wouldve got 5 stars if it wasn't for the charging cable): owned one of the prior year laptop strix scar, basically the same look and hardware base minus the updated graphics card, processor, and screen. The only flaw i noticed with these laptops is that the charging cable starts to become unfunctional after a year or so and replacements barely last a year due to minor movements with the laptop, sometimes im away at my desk and like to use it that way while its charing which contributes to the wear and tear of the cable which i barelly tug on it or at all.ASUS needs to work on the way they charge this laptop cause the design of the charging cable is flawed and stops charging due to minimal wear and tear. I replaced the charging cable like 3 times in the past 2-3 years.",0
(Only 2 months old and went kaput. Waiting for a conference call with Amazon Tech and Acer today.): It's like a Christmas toy from years ago. You get it and it might last 2 or 3 months.,0

(De lujo): Es un equipo muy bueno para las tareas de la escuela. Su dise?o es muy pulcro y esvelto. Talvez un poco frágil pero muy bonita. Recomendada.,0
it is filled with wonderful features,0
"(This Broke Before A Year!): I bought this laptop in the hopes that it would last me for a long time. Within three months the charger cable snapped off and left the charger exposed. The screen tried to pop out and when I pushed it back in the screen cracked. Now, the entire backing of the screen is starting to crack off. I've taken good care of this laptop and it has fallen apart on me. A complete waste of my money!",0
"(Buen producto, pero no buen sistema operativo.): Pros:Es un producto bueno y bien hecho en general.Al tener una tarjeta interna de 32 GB en vez de un disco duro normal, la escritura de datos es muy rápida.Tiene buena pantalla.Con un sistema operativo optimizado y ligero funciona de maravilla.Contras:No tiene luz de aviso de carga en el dispositivo. Así que si se carga apagado estás cargando a ciegas.El sonido que tiene en las bocinas no es muy bueno, aunque se entiende que sea así por el tamaño y la forma del dispositivo.El sistema operativo es un mastodonte que no anda rápido, pide constantemente esperar para apagar. La primera vez que esperé para apagar Windows 10 se tardó dos horas por actualizaciones o configuración inicial supongo.Para almacenar muchas cosas echarás en falta un disco externo o unidades usb o sd cards.Para alguien que necesite lo básico y no exija mucho es buena opción. Solo tomar en cuenta que:Si tienes conocimientos técnicos o alguien cercano que los tiene, lo mejor es optar por un sistema operativo alterno como Linux, en mi caso puse Debian. (no he probado con Android aún).Ya que con un sistema que vaya al grano y no cargue cosas innecesarias, la máquinita vuela. Ahora con el nuevo sistema estoy sumamente feliz con el equipo.",0
"(Excellent product, good performance combined with elegance): Very fast shipping to Chile, about 1 week, I am very happy with this product, all the games I have tried have had an excellent performance, including games like ""Control"" and ""R6"".It is a lightweight and very powerful computer with a high quality screen.It has a unique and beautiful design. The price I find is according to the power that is delivered.",0

"(So excited to have this): I had an old heavy laptop. I am really excited to have this one. Start up was a disaster. HP couldn't fix it. Microsoft couldn't fix it. Spectrum couldn't fix it. Finally my daughter tried!!!!! The airplane mode was on so I couldn't get wifi. No where was that even hinted at. If you can't connect to wifi instruction give you 1000 things that don't help!

I called Asus before my warranty expired, they had me do some steps that worked for a few days, called back and they told me my laptop was out of warranty and I could send it but I would be charged $70 for diagnostic plus whatever is wrong with it. I will never buy another Asus product in life.",0
"(Buen equipo): Muy buena laptop de momento ninguna falla, llevo 3 meses usandola, trae un disco duro con poca cantidad de almacenamiento, justifica el bajo costo. Con opción de hacer upgrade, vale la pena hacerlo.Muy bien en términos generales.",0
"(some bloatware and issues with dragon center and keys wearing off fast but otherwise good): I've had this now for 9 months and a few months ago I noticed some key etching was wearing off. That's pretty sad. The MSI Dragon Center won't let you change profiles unless you update, but doesn't notify you of an update. They shouldn't restrict functionality of the program which is already installed unless you install an update to that program. That's ridiculous. If I want to turn on super battery I shouldn't have to figure out that an update is required, close the program, update it and restart the computer. I should be able to use this functionality at any time I choose.For the most part though, it's been a fine laptop. It was tough finding one which fit the needs that I have and I rarely even use this for gaming but I wanted something powerful enough that I wouldn't see it getting bogged down from more demanding video streams like 4k 60 fps, etc...And I wanted a really good screen and above average keyboard. I don't like 60 Hz refresh rate as it's noticeably slow eve non desktop use once you are so used to high refresh rate on your main system.The colors are very appealing on the screen as well.The only thing is, this being my first laptop I sometimes wish that I had gotten a lighter one with a larger screen and higher resolution because I often miss having all that space that I have on my 27"" 1440p screens.",0
(SUPER NICE!): This is a quality computer. I have to get used to how light and touch sensitive it is. So glad I bought it!,0
"(Great Computer for Travel Gaming): Great computer for traveling and gaming. Its' a bit tricky to set the 3060/70/80 graphics card as the default instead of the built in Nvidia graphics chip, but at the end it all worked out.",0
(shuts down randomly): Randomly shut downs with no warning. In the past have had good luck with EliteBook's. This one is trash.,0
(Gran potencia y elegancia): Muy potente y buenisima bateria y acabado premium,0
(Very stable): Small computer perfect for work laptop plenty of power,0
(Won't purchase electronics or breakable items again): The laptop box arrived crushed on one side. The device was broken. I will never purchase electronics or tech devices online again.,0
But I'll be lucky to get half battery life just browsing the web.,0
"(Bad wifi card.): I'm on my third wifi card. The Realtec cards are a known issue. I've had to send this back twice since I bought it. Had it two months and haven't been able to use it yet.Update: Finally got them to send me an Intel card that I replaced myself. Solved the problem. BUT, new problems. There are residual windows left on screen after that program has been minimized. E.g., when it wakes, on the desktop will be a window for ""suggested contacts"" from a closed Outlook window. Sometimes will go away by trying to change resolution, but other times has to reboot.This is my 4th Lenovo. Never had a problem before, but am hesitant to buy again from them.",0
"(Kinda dim): I like the touch screen, and the 2-in-1 capability. However, the screen brightness is not great (maybe 300 to 350 nits). Also the super-glossy screen creates lots of specular glare, further reducing contrast. Had they used an anti-reflective coating, most of the problem would be gone. As it is, it works fine in a dark room with minimal reflections. In a vehicle in the daylight, forget it. This is a particular problem for me since I bought this device for vehicle navigation. Forget about it in the daytime. I might as well be staring into a mirror. At night I can turn the screen intensity down and set the theme to dark mode.The i7 processor seems fast, until it heats up. That takes about 2 seconds. Then it seems to throttle back. Keep it under 10% processor load, though, and it is great.In laptop mode I do appreciate the largish touchpad. I do not appreciate the lack of buttons below the trackpad. The tilt corner trackpad BS doas not work in the dark! They could help this by adding a lighted trail around the trackpad when the keyboard is lit. At least I could figure out where the corners are at. Otherwise I have to fumble around, then re-position the cursor, then fumble some more to find the correct spot to press, then put on a headlamp so that I can see what the hFll I am doing. Maybe they should include a headlamp to compensate for design oversights. The down side is that the headlamp will reflect off the display and blind the user at the wrong angles. Maybe just don't try to use it in the dark.I do like the keyboard. It is noisy, but users of mechanical keyboards will dig it.The pen seems to work. I tried it once, honest. However, since I have a keyboard that I can fold out, I really haven't found much use for it. That is saying a lot, because I am a hard core handwriting input type from way back. For now, I am not sure where the pen is actually at.Finally, mine came with windows 11 home. For me that means a few things: 1 - Windows 10 in a horifying clown suit, 2 - Loss of some important tactical features, 3 - No drive encryption using bitlocker. The last one is a ""Pro"" feature only. If I decide to ante up for Pro, I will install Windows 10.Oh, one last thing: the laptop will take a second NVMe drive, but installing it is not for the faint of heart. I do not know what the helz they were thinking on this, but adding and swapping hard drives are a given on ANY computer. Personally I would have designed it so that both drives could be ejected/swapped with a button. This little bit tells me that the manufacturer considers this a throw-away device in a couple of years. Maybe they are right.",0

"(It is amzing): For one thousand dollars you can get a lot of great powerful machines that offer 2070 GPUs. Thought this machine doesn't have that high end GPU the trade off is quite fans, and smooth running games that never heat up the system. Lenovo hardware is built to last. If you are looking for a laptop that can game and works well for being a student this is the perfect fit. If you want the most powerful system go for a custom built PC as I have seen and worked with many Laptops that have ridiculous components only to overheat and be unusable. great quality great price",0

(Very good laptop at a very good price.): I bought the GL65 leopard and I love it. Works awesome and is super fast. screen quality is awesome and games run smoothly. Laptop feels resilient and of high quality. The only thing I would say is a bit of a downside is the battery life. If you are going to play a big title game then you'll get maybe 3 hours tops on a full charge. I myself use always use it with the charger nearby so that's not really a problem for me. The fan can get a little loud when playing big games but I wouldn't say its bad. All in all for the price and the quality you get this is a good buy and I gave no regrets.,0
"(Worked fine for about two months): Worked fine for about two months. Right after the period when I could return it, it started shutting down randomly or just wouldn't go through the start process. Really annoying",0
"(Started a business from this awesome computer): Literally started my business from this computer, Not a heavily tech based/needed business but I absolutely love it. Went through 2 basic cheap $200-$300 laptops through and after college before this and wish I would have started here originally. Speed is great, battery life feels infinite at this point, and the touch screen is more accurate and more convenient than I thought it would be. The one and only draw back is not having a ""finger-friendly numerical input"" (phone digit 1-9 on the right side) but I'm sure that's due more to the size I purchased rather than the overall design. About 6 months in and I have yet to come upon a problem, and if so I'm sure Dell would take care of me. Definitely recommend to anyone in any situation.",0
"(I love this laptop): I bought this with an intention to also use for pave, it works, although steam displays a message the stats don’t work, he steamvr test passes with flying colors. I use this daily, for work and for play. With games such as Skyrim, hitman and beatsaber, I am impressed.

So far so good, I would also buy a laptop cleaning kit, keep those vents clean!",0

Made an appointment with the nearest Apple store (20 miles away). They confirmed my Mac was made this month so it was brand new but they can’t replace it since it was bought from Amazon and not Apple. They sent it out for a new battery under warranty which was to take 3-5 days and they have had it a week now and haven’t completed the repair yet. All around not a good experience for my first Mac and spending a thousand bucks on a laptop. I’ll be going back to pc after this.,0

The response time, refresh rate and color gamut are fantastic. This is my second MSI laptop, and I don't think I'll be changing manufacturers anytime soon.Pros: Price compared to other i7+2070 laptops, screen really is fantastic.Cons: Lots of plastic, built in speakers are pitiful.

I dont want your stupid internet explorer upgrade, I want to be able to use google chrome... I hate using bing. Anyways, this product is garbage and is instantly going back. If you like a socialist piece of foldable thrash, this is the one that will only allow you to use one type of internet app which is Microsoft edge which is ""superior and safer""I choose this instead of mac because Microsoft use to allow you to have free range and the freedom to do whatever you wanted, but this small gesture is a spit in the face.",0
"(Not what I expected): I like the storage, and the screen quality.I do not like the face that it still is not a ""lap"" top so to speak. A laptop had a cd/dvd in it... this does not.... a laptop is compatible with games that have been purchased and downloaded... this Acer is not. So if you have down loads some will not be compatible and you might want to rethink.... other than that.... it is pretty decent.",0
the laptop creaks when I pick it up,0
"(Too Many Shortcomings for Me): Loved many aspects of this laptop, but key shortcomings made it a deal-breaker for me. I returned it after a long trial.I currently use my 14” Lenovo X1 Carbon as my only computer. I travel extensively with it nationally and internationally. I use my laptop for heavy writing and editing, financial work, and photo editing. I almost always use it on my lap, versus on a table-top.The Gram 17” caught my attention due to the screen, weight, and battery life. I sometimes edit with two documents open side-by-side and the larger screen seemed ideal.What I liked: Screen size and sharpness, weight (although same as my X1), battery life, and much cooler running than my X1 (also the exhaust out of the hinge area moves the head away from my lap).What I didn’t like:Keyboard: The keyboard is critical for me. This was is substandard. Many keyboard shortcuts that involve one or two simultaneous button pushes on the X1 require three on the Gram. Why they consolidated keys on a computer with this much real estate is a mystery. The touchpad is centered on the entire keypad, rather than over the letters. I found myself regularly touching the touchpad and inadvertently moving things around by accident. Very frustrating. The idea of a dedicated number pad (as on this unit) seems absurd to me for general use, but definitely doesn’t work for a writer/editor. Bottom line: The biggest problem for me was the keyboard layout.Screen: The screen is highly reflective. I mostly work in natural light with a mirrored wall behind me. In strong daylight the screen can be very hard to use.Proprietary charger: My X1 has a USB C charger, which I can also use for my phone. The Gram has a proprietary charger. Complete wasted of an input.Size: For travel, this computer is just a little too big. Hard to get into a standard laptop sleeve and on airplanes would be hard to open with a seat in front of me. I sometimes work for hours on a plane and even my smaller X1 is cramped in some cases.Wobbliness: Because of the size of the screen, when using on a lap, the screen tends to waggle a bit. Not a huge deal, but it’s the nature of a light laptop and large screen.What would change my mind: If they were to redesign the keyboard to center it on the letter keys, perhaps dropping the right side number pad altogether, the greatest impediment to use would disappear. They could also spread out the keypad and reduce/eliminate the need for multiple key presses. The screen needs to be non-reflective. I would prefer a version with a 15 or 16 inch screen to reduce the overall size. They should dump the proprietary charger.",0
"(From Mac Air to Chromebook without looking back! Great transition!!!): It is very stressful for me to get new tech, being a more ""experienced"" person. My last phone had me wanting to throw it into large vats of water or stomp it with both feet and I did return it 3 times before finally managing to semi-adjust to it and I now have a so-so relationship with that piece of frustrating technology. So, when my Mac Air started to circle the drain I dreaded getting a new lap top. When my son recommended Chromebook I was skeptical that it could be as simple as it sounded to set up and use. But I was totally amazed!!! I had the lap top open and I was logged in with gmail in 5 minutes.Anything that I have needed to do has been easy to google. The screen quality and sound are both better than I had with the Mac but it was pretty old. The simple set up, speed and use of docs and downloads has been easy and I didn't have to buy software extra like I did with Mac. I also found connecting to my HP printer was much easier than the process to connect on my Mac.For me to transition from a Mac to the Chromebook was very smooth. This screen is so much larger than my Mac and has taken some getting used to. At this price my husband has encouraged me to get a smaller one to carry when we go somewhere but I am adjusting to this larger size. I thought the large size would be a viewing plus and it is. It's heavier than the small Mac and that is the adjustment. I use it for basics and work- banking, contracts, etc and I am very pleased!!! I will add that I never liked iPhones but did like my Mac Air but like the Chromebook much better so far.",0
(The most important thing is the speed of the SSD can't go wrong): Wonderful item will recommend I brought this for my son and He really really enjoying it,0
"(Poor value, especially vs. Mac.): This laptop has the latest, greatest new release Tiger Lake lntel Core i7-1195G7 processor. And it's a great looking laptop w/great specs. Build quality seems excellent. The screen is both bright and responsive. The keyboard feels good, although it has a slightly lighter touch than I prefer.But...It runs extremely hot, both on the surface and underside of the computer. You wouldn't want to use it on your lap or sitting on your chest, which by the way, is exactly how I often use it.My MacBook Air with the M1 chip blows it away. Not sure which has better performance specs, but the MacBook Air has no fan, doesn't get hot, and takes everything you throw at it.With the MacBook Air, you may get 14 or 15 hours of battery life out of it, with this Windows-based ""state of the art"" laptop, you might be lucky to get 3-4 hours.And the MacBook Air was almost 50% cheaper than the Windows-based laptop ($899 vs. $1,700).If you're in the market for a laptop and don't need to necessarily run Windows, the choice is clear. Otherwise, other than the issues mentioned, it's a perfectly fine computer and it's quite gorgeous. Is it worth the current asking price? Not in my view. 3 star rated.",0
"(Great value for the price.): For the price, one of the best you can get. Fans are loud, my screen has some backlight bleed and the power block on the cord is huge. But this laptop is exactly what I wanted, a reasonable price for a 10th gen i7 and a RTX 2070. One thing I don’t like is the speakers, they sound very muffled/tinny but I tend to use headphones anyways.",0
"(Dissappointed): I bought this to replace my current i3 Dell, which is 6 years old. It has slowed down considerably, and it constantly loses its wifi connection. At first, about a year ago, it would happen once or twice a week, but now it happens every few minutes. NOT my wifi. All other devices work fine. I did download and install updated drivers about a month ago, and it only made it worse. I need reliable WIFI for my job, to attend Zoom and Teams meetings. Out of the box, I was impressed with this model's speed and connectivity. But, I took it to work to show it off and when I got it home, it would not connect again. It was like its ability to connect to wifi just vanished. It's only a week old. I'm returning this and going back to Dell.",0
"(Fantastic): I've used Chromebooks for years as my everyday laptop. This 2nd generation Plus with an M3 satisfies all my normal needs and wants. I use multiple windows/tabs and this machine handles that without a problem. I pushed it to about 30 open tabs running multiple videos and audio before it bogged down.The display is beautiful at all angles. The keyboard travel feels l great and only lacks backlight. The track pad and touchscreen are flawless. Though I considered the pen a gimmick I have found it useful for some situations.Google has solved some of the problems Android apps had on Intel. The UI for switching between Chrome & Android apps has vastly improved, making a Chromebook more useful and productive. The pen is great for the Android photo editing apps and the Chrome app Polar.The 2in1 form works well. The hinges seem built to last, but I would say the Samsung is a bit too heavy to use as a tablet for more than 10 minutes. Google has improved the UI to the point where Chrome works well as a tablet. But, if you want a tablet first there are better options like the HP or Google Slate.This is an excellent laptop with only a few compromises. The plastic bottom creeks a bit, the only indication this is not a solid all metal body. I paid around $500 and that is an amazing value for a laptop that performs this well.",0
(Nice computer): Love it cant wait to use it,0
Battery life is not quite what was promised.,0
Computer gets very hot which causes loud fans,0
"(Killer gaming laptop): What I have liked most about this laptop is that this thing can bang with the best of 'em. There are obviously desktops that you can build for gaming that would be more powerful than this. But with this thing coming in at the price it does, for the specs, it's an unbelievable deal. With the 10th gen i7 and the 2070 non Max-Q card, paired nicely with the 144hz screen, gaming on this is an absolute dream. I would highly suggest buying this laptop for anyone looking to play any game they want, at high settings. Hope this helped someone!!",0
(Good buy): Worth $217 bucks for sure. Screen is not as crisp as I would like but it’s quick & gets what I need done.,0
"(Great Buy): This notebook was definitely worth the cost, it's a great every day computer. And it's small enough to carry anywhere.",0
The screen is really amazing.,0
"(Works well): Bought this for simple tasks such as running windows services, Spotify, Chrome etc. at the office. Intel's new gen processor does a really good job. Happy with the purchase.",0
(Buy better than this): I should have spent more for a better laptop. This is above average only but not supreme,0
"(Best Gaming Laptop I ever had): This Laptop is just the new version of Acer Predator Helios. I received mine after seven days. I really love this laptop. Much better cooling system than the older versions. This one is the 500gb version(Western Digital). It has also RGB lights on the keyboard. Photo and video editing can also work good on this laptop.Just an update (Nov 29 2019)Laptop is working good still. I'm playing Star Wars: Fallen Order and at medium and high settings and the game plays excellent. I have also downloaded Ni No Kuni Remastered and the temperature is mild warm. Battlefront 2 gameplay temperature is higher about 80 degrees celsius.Update (April 13 2020)Laptop is still working. I really love this laptop. The performance didn't decrease. Since the updates, my laptop doesn't warm that bad.",0

"(Can't ask for more): I've been a happy Android user for a long and I always wanted to try Chrome OS, but I was too afraid to leave the Windows ecosystem because of my job (I sometimes needed certain software that was only available for Windows). After I switched job, I finally decided to give it a try.I bought this Chromebook for around $400 (Dec 2019). It was my first Chrome OS experience. I decided to go with this one because it matched my needs (12 inch display, metal body, good looking, at least 4 GB of ram, and a price below $500). I also liked the aspect ratio when using tablet mode.So I made the purchase and 5 months later I am very happy with it. The build quality is great, it feels like a premium device. It is indeed a little heavy, which doesn't bothers me but it may to others. I got the M3 after reading some reviews which recommended it over the Celeron version. It handles everything I put on, which is basically browsing on Chrome with several tabs while playing a Youtube video on the background. I do not use it to play that much, but I've played Asphalt 9 a couple of times and it works fine, no lag whatsoever. I have experienced certain issues with Zoom when I'm on a 8+ people call, but I am not quite sure if it's an app matter or the device.The pen is a great tool, although I roughly use it. I guess that the only times I've used it is to show someone else how it works. It's still there and it's a plus for anyone that may take advantage of it.I would definitely recommend this Chromebook (for the price I got it).",0
"(After installing new bios (HP did this) and updating (Windows Update) everything I use works ok.): Sometimes when I write on social media, E-mails ect, if I use certain keys the curser jumps back causing me to have to reset it. Could be my fault. Otherwise I like it. My previous computer was very slow so I am impressed with the speed. I am happy with my purchase and I feel it was worth the money.",0
(Five Stars): Fast and compact.,0
"(The drivers for the wifi stopped working after 1 week. Then it won't let you connect to wifi.): 1 week and it won't allow the option to connect to wifi, therefore no internet",0
"(Great overall. Cons are battery(duh) and mine has mic jack static): A couple of months into use and this laptop is great overall. Other than some really minor issues with the software, the biggest cons I have experienced so far are with the hardware. First, the battery is pretty bad. It only lasts about 4 hours if you aren't pushing the laptop and it will last way less if you're doing anything like gaming or running more than 5 chrome tabs. Fortunately for me, I don't plan on moving this device around too much so I leave it near the charger. If you are expecting a better battery than this, good luck because either you pay way more money for a laptop with a better battery, or you buy this and deal with it because this is kind of the standard. Other than that expected fault, my unit came with some faulty ports. Specifically the USBs on the sides and the mic jack. The mic jack creates static noise through my headphones when plugged in and I know it's a hardware issue because having my hand on the chassis near the port silences the static meaning my hand is helping to ground the port. I haven't opened up the internals yet but I hope it's easily fixable. The USBs, especially the left one, are loose or something. Say I plug in a mouse-if I nudge the connector while in the port a bit, the mouse disconnects. The right USB does this less so I use that one. I haven't done any heavy gaming yet so I can't attest to its performance there yet, but so far the airflow during heavy usage seems good and the keyboard is very decent. Also, the webcam has a built-in manual slider to block/unblock it which was a cool bonus.",0
"(Perfect for business when on the go.): In my line of work I need something that's easily portable, fast, light yet durable with a sleek professional look. This precious little blood diamond has it all.",0
(Perfect): Perfect for my use case. No problem so far and I have three of these working 24/7,0

(Nice For games): Good computer,0
"(Fast, light and a sleeper): **Year long edit**This laptop is still going strong. Just as fast as the day It arrived. Adobe CC (AfterEffects, Premiere, Lightroom, Photoshop) all work like a champ. And when i'm not working, COD Warzone gets an average of a whopping 200fps. Was not expecting that, but glad to have it.Lightwave and Maya also render much faster than the old machine I was using as well.Given the chip shortage, this is definitely a contender to a Mobile WorkFlow.Eventually, I'll get around to swapping out the 512GB boot drive to either a 1 or 2TB m.2 and upgrading the RAM, but so far, I don't see the need to.A hard deal to bet, even in 2022Had this for about 3 weeks now and it is Fast!Runs all my adobe CC programs with no issue, and gaming to boot!The 1660Ti really shines.I added another 1TB SSD for more storage, bit still have about 70% freeBattery life could be better, but what I've read, you can get a bigger one and swap it out with little issue.",0

"(Works great, and the sound is fantastic): Love it, and the blu-tooth comes in real handy",0
"(Bonita, da el gataso y precio justo): es una laptop básica, para tareas escolares y ocio, la carcasa y los componentes incluso el teclado y la apariencia general, dan la idea de una laptop de hace 10 a?os, no esperes algo cool al respecto, aunque el color es bonito y realmente cumple con el propósito para lo que la quiero. si quieres edición de audio y video incluso videollamadas de buena calidad, aléjate de este producto no es para eso, en mi caso solo la quiero para reproductor de audio y karaoke, entonces no requiero de una maquina mas pesada, ayuda en este caso de que trae salida hdmi y puedo compartir a una pantalla externa, no me agrado tanto que el Sistema operativo venga en ingles y como es la version win11, cuesta un poco agarrarle el modo, pero insisto para lo que la quiero y por el precio, me parece justo y razonable...solo espero que no falle, hasta ahora se comporta muy bien.",0
"(this laptop would be fine for more casual laptop users but I am returning ...): not worth the price. screen does not get too bright, even after recalibration suggested by other amazon shoppers. not too fast. this laptop would be fine for more casual laptop users but I am returning it to get a better computer.",0
(Ok chromebook): This worked for what we needed except when my son tried doing a video call. On the other end all anyone could hear was a static noise. I returned this one. I would have reordered this one but I really like the touch screen. So I reordered a different HP that I already have and it works great.,0
(Just right): Wasn't looking for a super fast gaming laptop or anything heavy duty. Been working from home like most of us and really needed to upgrade. Pleasantly surprised with quality and price point.,0
"(Wifi connectivity sucks!): Without Wifi connectivity it's not worth it. The Wifi keeps on disconnecting, and it's super frustrating. I don't even use it so heavily. I have it for a little over a year. It's not worth the money for such a short time plus it wasn't working properly after a few months!",0
"(Very cheaply made): Not good. The keys were loose and the plastic holding the keys in place was warped and very flimsy. The overall feel of the computer is very cheap for the price tag. I couldn't say much about the battery or specs because to be honest, I opened it up and noticed straight out the box it was such low quality. I Just sent it back for a refund.",0
"(Perfect For Teens!): I purchased this laptop for my daughter for Christmas and she’s been hooked ever since. She mostly uses it to communicate with her teachers, read books online and to surf YouTube. It’s inexpensive and a perfect solution for getting your teenager off of your laptop.",0
"(Not really Refurbished): ...at least in my opinion, a cheesy job. Excess wear has been literally masked over with vinyl covering. Arrived dirty. Power supply looks new, but is running really hot.Also, there is confliting information in product claims. Just to be clear, youre NOT receiving a 2018 machine, it is NOT 2.9ghz, and it is NOT as pictured.",0
It can handle any game perhaps not at highest settings but it's well worth the money,0
"(Do your research.): Just make sure you research graphics card, computer chip, ram, storage if you are getting this to play games. I didn't do my homework well enough and found my specs on the lower end moreso than I would like in retrospect. Otherwise, it's a good laptop but settings might need to be tweaked to lower setting to play newer more demanding games.",0
(Exactly what I needed. Amazing value.): Extremely happy. Hoping to buy 6 more for training,0
"(wonderful working gaming laptop and great working laptop for school ...): Fast, wonderful working gaming laptop and great working laptop for school work. Great condition, sleek look, and charges pretty fast",0
(Five Stars): I absolutely LOVE it. It is amazing.,0
"(Incredible for the price): This is a remarkably good PC for the price. A full i7-10750 and a 2070 at $1400 is certainly nothing to shrug at. The steelseries keyboard is also a nice plus, as is the fact that it actually has a webcam, a feature that has suddenly become very useful. The laptop itself is also much lighter than I anticipated. The fans can run a bit loud, and removing the bottom plate in order to add an extra hard drive can be a bit hair-raising, but this rig is all around remarkable for the price.",0
"(Fast & efficient, no-frills workhorse): My four-year old laptop died recently and I did a good deal of research (shout out to www.notebookcheck.net) for 2022 laptops in the $1000 range with some specs I was looking for. What I found was slightly more expensive but A LOT more than I expected.12th gen Intel (beating out its AMD competitor, at least performance-wise), i7 14 cores makes most processes FAST. Pair that with a 115W+25W RTX 3060, and both work and play become smooth pleasant experiences.300 Hz screen, 1 TB PCIe SSD with a second slot for adding more memory, 16 GB RAM, adaptive screen brightness, list goes on and on.It's pretty light. Not light as air, but light enough to hold in one hand for quite a while without getting strained.Removing the bottom casing has been pretty easy and straightforward, and cleaning out the fans (four outlets!) and adding a second SSD have been straightforward.So far, it has NOT run very hot - with Armoury Crate (to customize) and an upgraded cooling system, fan noise levels have been quiet to acceptable.Dedicated volume up and down buttons/mute buttons are a nice touch and very handyBattery life is not bad considering the 12th gen Intel processor. Battery has 90Wh but still goes fast.I/O is not bad, got a Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port and another USB-C port (cannot charge via USB-C), 3.5mm headphone jack, an HDMI 2.0 port, and two USB-A 3.2 portsSmall things I wish they did differently:Keyboard's dull lettering and wide font make for VERY poor contrast. Sometimes in a dim room my keyboard backlight has to be on to see the lettering.This is not a lap-top. If you like working with your laptop on your lap, prepare to feel the burn. Fans are directly at the bottom and with poor air intake even on a flat surface, your lap or the area under your desk will start to feel uncomfortably warm. Raise the laptop slightly off the surface to allow for good air intake and things will start to cool down a lot.The battery/etc. indicator can be annoyingly bright and there's no built-in way to mask it. It shines in a dark room, even if the laptop's off.Somehow, Windows 11 has broken the sleep function for me. I use hibernate now.You can't turn off/on the screen backlight. At least I haven't found a way.Touchpad is okay, not that responsive sometimes.Verdict: It fits perfectly what I'm looking for, and then some more. So far, nothing major has cropped up. A little above my budget, but worth the bump up and I'm very happy with this purchase. Also disclaimer, I am receiving a 90 day warranty extension for my feedback.",0
(It did not operate properly/not at all.): I purchased this item for my 15 year old granddaughter to use in class. We were both disappointed on Christmas day when it did not work. I purchased another PC at Best Buys because she really wanted the PC. I have since returned the subject item and have been refunded. Thanks.,0

"(This laptop is awesome for the price): This laptop is awesome for the price. I got mine with the NVIDIA GTX 1050, 8GB RAM, and 256 GB SSD. If you are looking for a windows equivalent of a Macbook, look no further! I will list the pro's and con's I have noticed while using this for the last few weeks.PROS:Amazing design does not look like a gaming laptop but is very powerfullThe fan is not super loud when under stress (ex: playing GTA V high settings)Barely gets hotCan run almost any games (Fortnite, PUBG, GTA V, CSGO, +)Awesome audio qualityLightweight and thinBattery charges super fastCONS:Screen is a tn panel with horrible viewing angles but is not the worsttrack pad can be laggy and when scrolling can be mistaken for pinch and zoomThe bezels around the screen are black although the rest of the laptop is silverBottom of the laptop is plastic, but that means it doesn't get super cold/hot when its on your lapOverall, this is an awesome laptop. I though that getting a GTX1050 would not work for me, but it is pushing through everything I throw at it so far. The keyboard is nothing special not bad, not awesome. I'm having no technical issues like random shutdowns or screen failures. I would 100% recommend this laptop to anybody looking for a great thin light gaming laptop (that doesn't look like one) for an amazing price.",0
"(Highly recommend): Great product. I bought this laptop to replace my old desktop pc with outdated parts. In current times of ridiculous pc part prices, this laptop really came right when I needed it. It runs most games buttery smooth. I currently have it linked up to my gaming monitor at 144hz and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase.",0
"(Prompt delivery.): It arrived faster than was projected. I opened the box, checked for imperfections , then plugged it in. It worked. I will report further when I have used it some more.",0
"(ASUS will continue to be my first choice for a laptop.): While I did look at several brands. ASUS was my first choice when I was browsing laptops for my daughter. I chose this one over a DELL and an ACER, and she loves it. And I have full confidence it will last for as long as she is in college. ASUS is a really solid company as far as laptops in my experience. I bought my first one in 2009. Then I upgraded to my current one in 2016. I have seen reviews about how horrible their customer service can be. However, I cannot speak to that since in all the years I have been an ASUS user. I have never needed to contact them. So when it comes time to upgrade my laptop again, ASUS will be my first choice.",0
(Perfect for students and casual use.): I just got it today and I love it! It was easy to set up. It's lightweight. It looks nice. And it was a very good price.,0
"(Some points for potential buyers!): I received it 2 weeks ago and so far so good.Just a few notes for the potential buyers and the one who are still not sure whether to purchase it or not.1- Out of the box every thing was fine, but the WiFi download speed. It was terrible and I were sure something is wrong. I normally have around 50 Mbps download and around 100 Mbps upload speed. However, with this laptop it was around 1 Mbps download and almost 100 Mbps upload speed. I searched the web, but there were some wrong info. I reinstalled windows, updated WiFi driver through device manager but it was not the solution. The only solution was to update the Windows to the latest version (Windows 10 Fall Creators Update) and afterward upgrading the WiFi driver via the Intel's website (I mean downloading the driver from intel's website not the device manager). Now every thing is fine and the download and upload speed are as they should be.2- Besides the above mentioned issue, the most important issue, is the fan noise. I mean it starts working when you don't believe it is necessary and makes of course noise. I haven't checked the CPU temperature, but I found the cooling fan active when I was downloading a bis software package and installing some others which I believe is not that much. However, it seems it's due to the thickness of the laptop and it gets warm very quick.3- Last but not least, although the production quality is fine enough, the casing material (The Aluminium alloy I think) is not that great. You can easily feel the difference with a high-end laptop body like Apple MacBooks. However, that's not bad at all, it's just not premium.For the best parts, I would choose first the weight. You can't imagine how thin and light is that. Furthermore, the battery last for almost the whole day and you can be sure that you won't get out of charge through the day. Although ASUS claims 12 hours, for the mixes tasks like internet browsing, movie watching, some office works and general university stuff, you can be sure to have at least 8 hours of charge.All in all, I rate this great machine 5 star, since price-wise it's even more than the best. You get the latest Intel Core i5 together with 8GB RAM and 256 SSD in s very thin and light body just for 750$. That's great and I am satisfied till now.",0
(Five Stars): Great Quality!,0
"(Great and easy to use but very fragile charger.): Quick. Small. Easy to use as a backup laptop when you need something quick and portable. Only problem is the charger is the size of a toothpick. I’ve had this laptop all of a week and I already dropped it while charging and broke the charger. Seriously? Who thought this was a good idea. Nothing wrong with the seller or delivery, just the product is sensitive.",0
"(Great for the price.): perfect for basic web browsing and simple stuff like checking emails, online shopping and watching YouTube or Netflix. Speakers aren’t the worst either. Everything loads up fairly quick. Only thing that shows the cheap price is the screen. It’s pretty Low resolution. you’ll find yourself adjusting the screen a couple times to find the sweet spot but after a while you learn where it is. I highly recommend this laptop for someone that wants to do basic internet surfing.",0
"(Nice Entry-level Gaming Laptop with ""meh"" Battery Life and Annoying Lenovo Bloatware Installed): I purchased this machine with the purpose of replacing a 9-year-old laptop. I wanted a work machine that can play current gen games away from home and this laptop does the job well, but comes with annoying bloatware and has a ""meh"" internal battery when using work applications. The charging block that comes with it is cumbersome and large, and it makes it hard to situate myself in a public area if I need the charger. This is less of an issue during Covid-era, but is something to consider when purchasing it. The cool thing about it is that it charges very quickly.Wifi works fine and it comes with a ethernet cord slot when you need it. Video quality is good and refresh rate is adequate.Form Factor is strange as the GTX 1660ti pushes past the hinge of the screen, so you have the fans and video components jut out about an inch from where the base of the screen rests. Not a big deal, but definitely different than other laptops.This thing runs pretty hot, and the speakers are on the underside of the machine, if that matters to you. The keyboard feels very tactile and nice, but already prone to dust like a normal mechanical keyboard. I had to use a can of air to get some debris under the right arrow button out straight from the box, which was a bummer. You shouldn't eat while typing or working over a keyboard, but I foresee that being an even worse dilemma for anyone who does purchase this and doesn't heed that advice. The keys seem fragile, and made me too worried to make an attempt to pry off for further inspection.Finally, the computer comes preloaded with software called Lenovo Vantage. It has some features that are useful and not standard to Windows 10, but it also will show you ads in the notification section of your OS, so I was really not jazzed about that.I'll probably forget to update this review down the line if my feelings change, but if it's anything like the last laptop I had, I'll probably bump it up a star or two based on longevity.",0
"(Battery Charger Doesn't Work): I couldn't really use it a lot yet since the battery charger is bad. It only charges when you hold it a certain way, and that is brand new out of the box.",0

"(don't believe the hype, battery won't last long): Great Design and RGB effects in the back is so cool.but battery won't last long more than 1hr while playing games.other than that, this is a great device.yes of course, the gaming side, most of AAA games are play well on this devicefor the price range, I will say 50/50.",0
"(Gamers, heads-up. Wi-Fi 6 is here.): You know Acer is speaking to you when you open the box, lift the heavy power brick, and see (because it's bigger) that they are using a standard computer power cable instead of the usual brick cable (a plus, because you can misplace the cable!), but then you see a small package of screws. Why? So you can upgrade the SSD (this model shipped with 512GB) if you want.That speaks to me. We're not just gamers, we're tweakers and perfectionists. OK, I exaggerate.PRO- Cool, efficient boot process. Lights, camera (well, display) & (keyboard) action.- Boot keyboard illumination signals might be useful given a legend- Illuminated keys- Wi-Fi 6 (a serious improvement -- see Consumer Reports story on benefits for WiFi 6 routers)- Even the network ports are named ""Killer.""

(I usually disable one in order to simplify things for the drivers, or at least the part of the stack that has to sort this out.) I was skeptical, but it did seem to work, at least on a modest load. Nice.SUMMARYYou get a lot for the bucks here, considering the Nvidia component. Of the missing features, the tradeoff that bothers me most is the touchscreen, since we're so often switching between smartphone and laptop.",0

A little heavier than I expected,0
(Great for the Price): This is the perfect computer for me for the cost. Great features.,0
"((Updated 9/17/18) - All-Rounder Sleek Laptop - Defective Luck): (UPDATE 9/17/18) Tested the laptop thoroughly with random gaming, video streaming from Amazon Prime movies while on battery mode. System will completely blank out the screen with no system response unless you hold the power button down. When turning the system back on and log back into Windows, the screen would flicker a lot for maybe 10 seconds then look perfectly fine afterwards. This issue continued at random with the same blank screen issue. Battery had about 50% capacity at the end. House has an ambient temp of 77 degree F with a ceiling fan for the controlled environment. Sad but I will be requesting a return and hopefully a replacement to give this wonderful system class another go. Depending on the QA ethics at ASUS, there might have been no thorough thermal testing and extensive benching before system was packaged for any possible software/hardware defects.(UPDATE 9/14/18) Wife reported that the system has randomly shutdown twice this week while on battery during work. Considering a request for a replacement. Dropping down the level of quality for this product of a brand name with another star drop.(UPDATE 9/11/18) Wife complained that the screen would turn off and had to completely force shutdown to restore. Issue still occurs when on battery mode and power was over 60% charge.Created a Disk Image of current system and started updating majority of the system driversIntel Chipset/Wifi/BTIntel VideoNvidia GPUDisk CleanupWill follow-up later if this helps. Might consider a laptop replacement for a crappy deployment as the initial Windows Logs in the System log files shows a good amount of errors occurring when the instance of the screen turned off for a driver issue of some sort. To lazy to investigate further.(UPDATE 9/7/18) After the 1st week of usage, the system will randomly power down into a sleep state in battery mode. Ran the Asus BIOS Updater and found Version 300 2018/08/21. Initially Version 206 2018/06/21. Tested system in battery mode again with all Office 365 applications opened and Adobe Creative Suite apps such as Acrobat and Illustrator running to replicate what the wife was suffering through when she complained about the sleep/power down issues. System seems stable for now.Was patient for ASUS to refresh their Zenbook Pro as the UX550VE model was nice but it was at it is end of life. Was hoping to find a decent all-rounder laptop with a GTX 1060 that was under 5lbs and around 15"" of screen space but this was fitting the needs properly. After reviewing gaming performance on the GTX 1050 Ti against the 1060, give and take. The UX550GE has a nice body but it will leave evil finger marks on the exterior. The fingerprint reader works nicely for the unlocking Windows and the setup process was straight forward. Please note, since I work in IT as a Desktop Engineer, I seriously hate Win10 with the Cortana features and telemetry crap. ASUS Win10 Image is current 1709 latest release.Played Blizzard Heros of the Storm and Starcraft II. The Intro videos did display some minor distortion on the 4K screen but it held up find for the most part. Have not been able to test 4K movies yet but hoping it will be smooth.Accessories include a microfiber cloth, a spare power velcro tie, Ethernet dongle.Some Notes on the side, I have worked on various Lenovo desktop and laptops, MS Surface Books, Surface 3 and 4, MacBook Pros and they have their Pro/Cons. I must say for the ASUS Zenbook Pro, this laptop series will fair well for good content creation and part-time video gaming.PS: This is for my Wife so I am jealous of her now!",0
"(the motherboard stopped working in about a year and half, and amazon and seller refuse to help): not sure if this specific laptop was a lemon, or the model has general issues, but after having owned about 20 computers and laptops, this has been the only one that didn't even make it to 3-4 years and when it broke the cost to fix it was about $400 which is certainly not worth it. Tried to work with amazon and the seller but go the run around. terrible purchase and experience for me on this one.",0
"(Battery doesn’t charge.): Got the laptop and the battery doesn’t charge. The moment I unplug it, it dies.",0
"(Good Laptop for the Price): Item #1 below is focused on Windows 10 S Mode. I didn't intend to write so much about S Mode, but I did so and thus it is there for you to consider. The rest of the comments made are about the Asus laptop itself.1.) I find Windows 10 S Mode to be excellent. The more I use it, the more I like it. {I've used S Mode on other devices for about 8-months.) You can exit S Mode easily, but I say it is really an awesome and an under rated OS. It virtually blocks malware, period. You can't tell the laptop is in S Mode unless you try to install something from outside of the Windows Store. Unless you are a gamer or need some special program, S Mode should be considered. It can save you a lot of concern about being compromised by hacking, which is becoming more of a concern of late, especially with the increase in sophistication in attacks from nation states and organized crime. Yep, I'm a techy with an opposing view to the techie press. Seems they mostly trash Windows 10 S Mode, but they rarely seem to articulate the benefits of S Mode. I think Microsoft should do a better job of marketing the OS. Why they don't is beyond me.I upgraded from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro via the Windows Store. I then as an admin joined this device to Office 365's Intune. I realize the tech world seems to talk down Windows 10 S Mode, but I am a contrarian and think it is outstanding. Also, S Mode requires way less Windows updates than regular Windows so, again, I am a fan. As an admin, I don't need to concern myself with updates as much. This OS is really hard to compromise.2.) This laptop is an outstanding value for the price. It has and i3 Intel processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD hard drive. Really, this is perfect configuration for the average business or college user. The performance is excellent for what it is equipped with. The i3 Intel chip works a lot better than most people realize. Even running when streaming video, it does well.3.) The display is adequate for business use. If you are a gamer or watching lots of video, it will likely be somewhat disappointing, good displays cost. You don't usually get something for nothing. Again, the display is adequate for what it is. Although the viewing angles are tight, I've seen other reviewers comments about the display and find their comments exaggerated and I wonder what they expect for a laptop that costs less than $500. Let me add that I have worked on a lot of PCs over the years, and I can tell you this display is good, but not great. However, if you want a premium display, like I said earlier, you need to pay for it. Again, this display is good enough for general use.4.) The ports provided are the latest version of each type provided. Again, this laptop is a great value for the cost.5.) The backlit keyboard is really good. I like the feel of the keys, and I like the numeric pad. The keyboard is quiet and comfortable to type on.6.) The laptop's body/frame. Is plastic. Looks pretty darn good given the price of the unit. However, I am unsure as to how strong the body is should the laptop take a fall. I'm not doing a drop-test on this one because I have pay for it if I break it, but again, the price point of this laptop gives you a pretty darn good device for the price.CONCLUSION: A surprisingly great laptop for the under $500 price charged and will be appreciated by a general or average user. (Suggestion: Keep the device in S Mode and save yourself malware and update headaches.)",0
"This is surprisingly light for such a burly-looking machine, less than a half-pound heavier than my XPS 9570, not hard to carry around.",0
"(Mine is nice but it has a really bad smell?): Only problem, mine has a hard smell like mechanics, what should I do? Is this normal? I can smell it in the entire room?",0
"(Its ok): Computer works for what i need, does not have enough space to perform updates or much of anything else",0
"(Good but serious issue): What good is a laptop if the touchpad is glitchy? This is entirely unacceptable. The most fundamental feature and Asus can't get it right. I've nothing else to say. Except that the speakers are low volume. Like absurdly low volume. Plus they are placed underneath, making it worse. Also, the screen flickers a few days a month. Oh, and important ""delete"" key is placed far away from fingers. It's actually a decent laptop other than the speakers and the touchpad. I hate that I bought this. Has caused so much aggravation.",0
(Sent the wrong color.): Wanted the starlight and got silver. Otherwise it’s fine,0
(Great company): I ordered two laptops for Christmas presents. The screen on one of the laptops stop working. I sent the laptop back and my money was refunded in a day. I could not been more happy. Great company to deal with. I am planning to re-order the same laptop today. My kid loves this laptop. The speed is fast and the picture quality is awesome.,0
(Cheap $150 Amazon Chromebook Review): Very average laptop. Did not go as well as I thought.,0
(Five Stars): Excellent choice for a gift,0
(Meets our needs): This computer does everything we need it to do.,0
"(don’t buy it): Bought this in December and didn’t start using it until the last couple of weeks with the isolation. It lasted about two weeks, and now just has a gray screen. needless to say it’s too late to return it😥",0
(A great pc): A great computer for kids school work or a first pc. Actually anyone would like this if they need a good computer and the size is decent.,0
"(You get what you pay for): You get what you pay for. It functions and does the basic necessities, but is slow and has poor audio quality (very low max volume) and poor web cam quality. Found it not that great for video calls. I default back to using my cellphone because it’s better quality. If this is what you can afford, it will get the basic stuff done.",0
(Great product): No,0
(Artículo y entrega muy bien): Muy bien ?,0
Was super easy to unscrew the bottom and add in an extra SSD,0
"(Bought on Prime day for a steal): Bought this for work to replace my MacBook and I love it. I have a custom built PC, so I don’t use it for gaming. But the Ryzen handles my workload and 10 hour work days like a beast. The only downside is the battery life isn’t the best as compared to competitors. The track pads feels cheap (just use a mouse) and the screen does wobble when hit. Still would recommend over most MacBooks.",0
"(Definitely not a new computer): Refurbished in the sense that the harddrive was wiped and new software was uploaded. All hardware is original. Thus, RAM and harddrive operate with typical degradation... slow process times, slow boot up, noisy magnetic drive, noisy cooling fan. Plan to return this computer.",0
"(NOT worth the money / Just for style and Brand): Firstly, I absolutely adore Samsung products. I’ve owned galaxy phones, tablets, TV’s. This laptop is defiantly NOT meant for gaming due to the low end graphics card, and you can barley stream xbox or games online, even though this comes with the intel core I-7 processor, this computer was extremely slow, multitasking was horrible, and lags. The laptop gets soo hot to the point where it’s unusable even when you just watch YouTube videos or the screen is idle…. this laptop looks beautiful, but this computer is only good for looks and style... the laptop is soo thin you constantly feel like you’re going to break it or bend the screen, my suggestion invest in a Microsoft surface laptop or a Lenovo. I love Samsung, but I will be returning this device; not sure if my unit was defective or not, but it’s not worth the price tag, this laptop should’ve at least be priced around 700.The good thing about this device is that the screen is vibrant and very beautifully immersive. Watching videos are amazing at the highest settings and IN HDR.",0
"(Issues with Touchpad and Display Driver): Laptop is extremely light...love it for that as I'm a writer and carry my laptop around daily.On the flip side, the touch pad works if your run your fingers closer to the bottom. The top part of the pad is non-responsive. The Intel graphic display driver breaks down every other week, freezing the laptop. I have to reinstall the driver frequently.Within 3 mths, battery life had decreased from 10 hrs to 6hrs, although the product boasts a 12hr battery life on its package.",0
"(Poor sound, but otherwise a good purchase): Poor sound quality and it isn’t very loud even at 100, so if you are an avid music listener, I would NOT purchase this. Otherwise, the screen resolution is great and it seems to be fast overall! Set up is extremely easy, as Cortana walks you through it, took about 5 minutes.",0
(Five Stars): Battery life is superb,0
"(Great find. My son loves it): Great find. My son loves it. He does not like school; yet, he is excited to do his homework on his chrome book.",0
"(Lo que necesitaba): Rapida, y no se friza, Me encanta!",0
The flipped motherboard was a great choice,0
"(Update: Awesome laptop): I'm coming from a 2008 Sony Vaio so this was a major upgrade. I only use it for programming and it's lightning fast, having SSD really helps. It looks premium and I have no problems with build, also keyboard flex is not an issue nor is the power button placement. I definitely recommend for the price, you can't beat it.I bought this in May 2018 and I have to replace the battery, pretty short lifespan but I am sure the average battery for this computer will last longer. -1 star.",0
(An excellent gaming laptop that stays cool): The Lenovo Legion 5 is an excellent laptop. I've used it for some pretty graphics-intensive games and have had no problems with cooling or performance.,0
(Five Stars): Great product.,0
"(Very good quality): I've been using this laptop for a few weeks. It is very nice and fits most of my needs. I wish that it had one more monitor out, but I make due with one plus the laptop's monitor. I usually use 3 monitors.The fan is fairly loud when the GPU is under load during gaming, but that doesn't really bother me. The battery life is not as long as it could be and I would like a larger battery option, but I mostly use it plugged in.",0
"(Seems like quality, no issues so far.): Fast, easy to use",0
"(Impressive!): I am pretty blown away by his laptop. I had been using a Dell Inspiron 5755 (12 GB RAM) for years as my work computer, and this is a huge step up. I wish the screen was larger (15.1), but other than that. It is amazing. With 16 GB RAM it exceeds anything I need, and I imagine this would be a dream for a gamer, especially a teen, who would appreciate the lights on the keyboard more than I do. Easy set up. It is, also, surprisingly quiet. It is a bit pricey, but the performance is top notch so far.",0
MSI makes it easy to keep the machine's drivers updated.,0
(Five Stars): Works great. Easy to use.,0
(Awesome): Bought this for my middle schooler!! It’s perfect works great!! Perfect for the price!!,0
(Great laptop): Should mention non-lighted keyboard.,0
"Small, lightweight pretty looking and powerful with lots of speed.",0
(Good product): Very useful computer,0
"(Very lightweight, good speed, but NOT gold at all): Updated review with more detail [after 2 weeks]. ** See additional note re color.I switched to Mac 11 years ago, and for that entire period, I had the same laptop, a Macbook Pro, late-2011 model. After the initial adjustment, it has been a great laptop for all of these years. I used it for school, work, online browsing, a few applications, and streaming videos. I have never gamed on my 2011 laptop. Of course, it slowed down considerably after several years, and software and hardware updates can only help so much with an older model. So, I finally decided to purchase a new laptop, and based on my research on recent macbook models, the price and value was right on this 2020 Macbook Air.GENERAL FEATURES: Switching from a Pro to an Air model is weird at first because the Air is SO thin and lightweight. It has an extremely slim profile. I have to be extra careful when I grab the laptop to move to another room. Like other reviewers have said, the screen extends almost to the edge with minimal bezel, which also means very minimal border, so you are getting a ""larger"" screen. I did not mind the thick bezel black border on my pro and have been used to it for so long, but I took for granted that it actually provided a lot of protection for my screen. The macbook air has almost no bezel, which in my opinion, is not ideal. Let's hope it doesn't drop or get off balance because there is basically no protection for the screen. My older macbook pro has fallen a few times on it's corner or edge in 11 years and been fine, aside from minor cosmetic damage. But the larger edge and bezel came in really handy on the macbook pro when it lost balance and fell off the counter several years ago, but I quickly saved it by grabbing it by the screen and significantly reducing the impact when it landed [luckily not on hard floor]. Obviously not an ideal way to grab it, but it was a necessary save in that moment. The only damage was cracks through the top of my screen from the pressure of my palm, and some minor dent in the bottom of the laptop. Cosmetic damage, but thankfully did not effect the screen light, LCD, or anything else. I do not think the macbook air would survive this, especially how the screen is built.BATTERY: Upon opening the box, the battery life was already pretty high, and I decided not to charge it until the battery decreased to around 10-15%. I was still using my original macbook during the day for work, and the new macbook air during the evening for mostly online use and going through all of the system preferences and settings, and watching youtube in the background. Keeping that limited use in mind, I did not need to charge it for maybe 1 week. Great battery life thus far. I will likely be shifting to use this macbook air for work soon, in order to take advantage of the current OS, higher ram, and M1 chip, especially because I connect to virtual servers, which can take a toll on the ram and processor.SPEED/PORTS/BLUETOOTH: Compared to an older model pro, it has good speeds so far. I already knew that the number of ports have been reduced significantly, and that air has less ports than a pro anyway, so I purchased a thunderbolt adapter and a USB hub in advance to take care of that issue. So far, the thunderbolt adapter works fine to connect the macbook air to my Thunderbolt Display monitor. The bluetooth was able to connect to my ear buds, although pairing did take a bit longer than I expected. The bluetooth preferences do seem to be less detailed/less options than my previous macbook pro.CHARGER: ** In my opinion, the previous magnetic chargers were superior to the current ones. They attached via magnet, the indicator light was red while charging, and green when fully charged. Easy and convenient. The mag-safe charger on this computer requires an additional push to be plugged in fully. This is just like most electronic devices, so it is not a bad feature, just requires an adjustment. It is probably safer for the computer and prevents it from easily coming unplugged. However, there is no indicator light, so you can't tell that it is plugged in and successfully charging unless you look at the battery status in the menu bar, and you also cannot see when it is finished charging just at a glance. You cannot confirm when the laptop is closed or on lock screen. You have to open the laptop, log in, and then check. Big bummer. **MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES: My previous macbook had a great feature: check the battery life at a glance with a quick push of a button while the laptop is still closed. After some additional research, I realized that apple removed the battery light indicator on the macbook pros many years ago, and that airs never had this feature. Big bummer. There is no way to check the battery life on this model without opening the laptop AND logging in, as the battery status in the menu bar on lock screen only shows the icon, but won't show you the percentage until you log in. Not ideal at all.-------Quick review for recently purchased product [during Black Friday]. I will update with a more detailed review once I have used it for a longer period.***** Important Note: If you are on the fence about purchasing the ""gold,"" don't get it. I had a silver MacBook Pro for many years, and I went back and forth for several days about the gold, especially after reading recent reviews and viewing customer images on multiple retailers that said the gold is closer to rose gold. I would disagree and say that the color is actually better described as dark blush pink or dark a reddish-mauve. Definitely not the look I wanted to have, and I regret not purchasing the staple silver, especially as I keep my electronics for many years beyond the 'normal time.' It would be a hassle and a lot of money to purchase the silver instead, since we cannot exchange in-store.",0
"(Three Stars): A trash screen, you will see nothing if the angle is not right.",0
"(Amazing laptop for it's price.): The 8GB RAM can be a problem if you're using Windows. However, if you're a programmer, researcher etc and you usually run your code on a server this little cheap piece of hardware is the best you can get at this price. I'm running Archlinux on this (and mint from a usb boot) and it works great.",0
"The smooth monitor, best in graphics for laptops, easy gliding keyboard, and software that help enhance the over all experience when using this beauty.",0
"(Do not buy, multiple troubles): Sound issueDefective fanBattery issue who won't be charged even plugged in.Don't buy this laptop and save yourself the trouble.",0
(My daughter ordered the chromebook with her graduation money and ...): My daughter ordered the chromebook with her graduation money and she loves it. It works well for her. As long as she doesn't sit on it again and damage the screen which we just ordered and replaced over the weekend!!,0
"(256 GB SSD Hard Drive NOT 512 GB SSD as stated in the description.): Disappointing, this looked like a great deal. They did not send what we agreed on.",0
"(back light made it easier to see at night): Liked the computer, very response, loved the back light, because I'm older screen was too small for my old eyes.",0
"(Safe your money): The only thing I didn't like about it is that the audio does not work that well, you can barley hear it. You have to use head phones to hear it clearly. I would not buy this again. Did not work for me, but maybe for others.",0
RTX 2070 Max Q is more than plenty for the latest and greatest,0
"(great storage and display): I was in a need of a good laptop with a good amount of storage rom AND ram for regular use and creating music. A few things I specifically liked about this laptop is the storage, the crisp display, touch screen feature, good battery life, light weight, and fast processor. A few things I didn't quite like are there are no separate buttons for right/left mouse clicking, comes with a lot of bloatware (but some could be removed), and not ideal port options for me.I noticed alot of the reviews state that this laptop comes used. In my experience, the box that the laptop was in had a dell return label on it underneath the new label, but did not appear to be used or opened so not sure what is going on.",0
"(Simple but effective, cuts the corners you expect…): This Dynabook (formally Toshiba) Satellite Pro laptop is a pretty good deal for the price. Obviously, at this price point, you are making tradeoffs between power and display, build quality and cost. The balance between these tradeoffs is pretty good. The Intel i5/Iris Xe graphics and 8GB of DDR4 RAM are not going to get you very far in AAA gaming, but with a Cinebench CPU multicore rating of 3673, you can absolutely play light PC games and will experience no delay with a few Chrome tabs or watching online streaming. The 15.6-inch FHD is 1920x1080 and gets pretty bright. With pretty minimal bezels, it is pleasant to use and peruse. The M.2 PCIe storage is quick and, at 256GB, you should be more than fine if you pair this with an external hard drive or a cloud service.Performance aside, you really see a bit of corner cutting on the keyboard and trackpad. The keyboard is tacky and has no backlight, so it really isn’t a pleasant experience to use and I wouldn’t suggest typing on it for any duration. The trackpad fairs a little better, but I have noticed that I do get some ghosting and have found that it fails to register clicks with an annoying regularity. To be clear, these are not deal breakers, but worth noting. All in all, it is a fairly decent low to mid range laptop.",0

(Great laptop for great price!): I use this for my digital DJ business running software for music. The build quality is excellent and runs as expected. I've added a second SSD and and additional 8GB of RAM. Screams like a banshi!,0
"(Piece of crap): Do not buy from this seller!! False advertising, it is not touchscreen, tried to get in contact with seller and nothing. Then after having it for 3 days it shuts off while still being fully charged and never turns back on!! Returned it and still waiting for my refund.",0
"(Warranty is horrible and with windows PC you need a good warranty): My computer crashed, no surprise windows computers always do. Windows 10 would not reload. I lost everything. I called the ASUS warranty customer services line. They agreed it was within my warrranty period. They informed me that I would have to mail the PC to them which takes up to 3 business days, then it would take 7-10 business days to repair it not including the time to ship it back to me. Do these people understand people need their PC’s and that if they go even a day without one in the age of COVID it could cost them this jobs! Do no buy this product.",0

"(Great value): This laptop is great for basic computing needs (word processing, spreadsheets, email, web browser, etc.), and at a very reasonable price -- thus an excellent value for a very capable entry-level computer. It came with an 11th-generation Intel i3 processor, 4 Gb RAM, and a 128 Gb solid-state drive. I added 8 Gb RAM in the single open memory slot, and a 1 Tb hard-disk drive for user files -- reserving the SSD for the operating system alone. On-line references made it easy to do those add-ons myself. The result is a surprisingly fast computer which I highly recommend for the types of tasks listed above.",0
(Worth it): Very good laptop,0
"(Super fast laptop for work!): I don't use this laptop to play games, but to work editing videos with 2D and 3D animations. Compared to my desktop i7-7820X, this i7-11800H is 25% faster, but the difference is in the NVidia Geforce RTX 3070 video card, it is 4 times faster than my desktop NVidia Geforce RTX 1660. I can work on it 8K videos in DaVinci Resolve 17 without any problem and animate in Fusion easily due to its 8 GB of VRAM. The prices of electronic products are going up, so I decided to buy it now before the prices go up any more.Another advantage of this laptop is its aluminum chassis, which unlike my previous laptops, is very strong and feels sturdy. The mechanical keyboard is very good and the battery life of about 4 hours is relatively acceptable for a laptop with that much power. My previous gaming laptop had a battery life of 1.5 hours.What I don't like is that it only has two M.2 bays and that the fans make too much noise if I use it in the most powerful mode.Otherwise, it is an excellent purchase.",0

"(Excelente dise?o, gran rendimiento y aun precio actualmente accesible): Estaba buscando una laptop para un familiar que comienza sus estudios, sin embargo actualmente todos los equipos electrónicos están a unos precios altísimos, y los pocos que se encuentran por debajo de los $10,000 MXN son equipos de muy bajo rendimiento como procesadores Celeron y HDD, este equipó sin embargo es la excepción con componentes de mas alto rendimiento como lo es el hecho de traer incluido SDD y un procesador I3.Yo utilice el equipo para realizar las instalaciones de programas básicas correspondiente y estoy satisfecho con el rendimiento que mostro, así como la velocidad de encendido.Recomiendo totalmente juntar un poco mas de dinero e ir por un equipo como este en vez de un equipo con Celeron.",0
"(Great item and quick shipping!): The item is great, allows me to be productive without worrying about performance being an issue. It was shipped quickly and arrived at my front door just 5 days after purchasing. Highly recommend this laptop for those who don’t need the highest specs but, can get by doing mostly everything you throw at it just fine.",0
(Excelente para tareas): Excelente para uso escolar o laboral,0
"(Awesome): I really like the ASUS brand. I got this one because I could add a faster nvme drive. So I added the fastest one out there. What a difference. Yes, I would buy ASUS again. And the warranty price is great. You buy this online at stores that will build it for you and the price is ridiculous. Do a google search at what a reasonably price for a warranty is.",0
(Little bit disappointed): It looks very good but one of my key board “G” stop light up . I text to the seller but no response for a long time . That’s why I gave him 2 stars !!!,0
(Works fine): I purchased this for coding so its perfect for what i need.,0
"(Simplemente espectacular): El rendimiento del equipo es genial, la duración de la batería es asombrosa, cumple con todas funciones descritas, lastima que solo tiene 2 puertos tipo C, pero con la compra de un Hub se soluciona el problema. En resumen una muy buena adquisición de mi parte.",0
"(Dell XPS, they are quality machines.): This machine worked like a champ right out of the box this is my second XPS 13 and I love them. It is a bit small but if you don’t mind that the price is good, if you want bigger pay a little more and get the bigger XPS, they are quality machines.",0
"(A powerful laptop that doesn’t break the bank): Great laptop. Construction seems pretty sturdy for a plastic body. Have only used for a few hours but so far it seems like a computer that has great power and speed for its price point. The keyboard keys have a good action to them new, but we’ll see how they hold up as the keyboard gets broken in. I was surprised how big the charger is, but overall the entire computer with charger is still not that heavy. Cooling seems good so far. I think the only thing I’m not a big fan of is the big logo on the front looks a bit cheap, but honestly this doesn’t effect the quality of the computer as a whole. Would definitely recommend.",0
Extremely light and durable.,0
(Product had open company label. No security and for $2200 that doesn't sit well. Sent it back): This is the second after returning another for a broken ASUS label. New not refurbished. I have bought $200 products that were sealed but I guess you cannot get a laptop sealed. This is not sitting well with security. I sent second back also. Best Buy here I come,0
"(Good quality): Good price, workmanship, quite an asset",0
"(Tricked him into studying more!): I bought this to get my son to study more, even though I don’t allow his computer games most of the time. It worked. He takes pride in his online classes. And he has game nights on Fridays, too.",0
(Great budget gaming laptop): Use this for gaming and absolutely love it works great for all the games I've played so far including new world,0
"(Very good laptop): I bought it three months ago, it works great and very fast. the video card for this lab is so good for rendering, I bought 2TB SDD card and easy to install, I installed by myself with no problem. need to watch videos on Youtube to install if you a beginner so you do not break something. I give it 5 stars b/c it deserves it.",0
"(Just what I wanted!): I love this little laptop; the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the storage limits. I removed Xbox and several other apps I won't use, added MS Office, Adobe's Pdf Reader and Paint.net......and only have 10 gbs of storage left, so I will have to be careful. Even so, it's lovely! Lightweight, fully functional and a perfect tablet with a keyboard! I wanted it for traveling, and it's perfect to take along!",0
"(Works great for gaming, rgb lights are a nice touch): The only issue I have is keeping the GPU temp down when playing call of duty. It usually runs at 84c, but I don't have a cooling pad yet and also I dont overclock. I haven't had any issues with any game. The RGB lights are a nice touch and you can adjust brightness and colors. They also come in static or dynamic lighting too. Overall, great aesthetics and is worth the extra $200 for the rgb feature from the 78XL model. Good budget gaming laptop, no need to spent 2k",0
(La peor calidad y el servicio técnico es deplorable): Al poco tiempo de uso la pantalla muestra distorsiones en la imagen. Envié a reparación y luego de 4 MESES de correos e insistencias telefónicas me han enviado el computador EN LAS MISMAS CONDICIONES. Es una falta absoluta de seriedad del servicio técnico que nos ha dado constantes largas. Lo peor es el dinero gastado y los problemas ya que es una herramienta de trabajo.No me resuelven el problema y Amazon me indica que no puede hacer nada al respecto.,0
(Nice product): Nice product,0
(Terrible): Worst computer I have ever bought,0
(Junk): Junk. Have had for a year so far. Has not worked properly after the first month of use.,0
"(DO NOT BUY): Terrible, absolutely terrible.. Low amount of storage that is eaten up in no time by Microsoft Windows updates and various other Microsoft bloatware, can't seem to install anything because it has such low storage, if you do happen to install an application, good luck getting it to run properly. Terrible! Do not buy!",0
The picture is bright and clear and really pops,0
"(Started shutting off randomly after 3 days. Completely unusable by day 5!): I received this product on a Sunday. The design is simple, sleek and very appealing. Although it does feel cheap and fragile as the outside all plastic. I did notice that the initial power on required several attempts. I put it on the charger thinking the battery might be dead. The chrome book powered on and I didn’t think anymore about this little issue, and the battery was almost fully charged once I got to the main desktop. I took this device to a conference for notetaking 3 days after receiving it. It worked very well for about 3 hours. Then it shut down spontaneously. The device powers up very quickly so I just restarted the computer. Then it happened again, and again and again. By day five it would only last about 2 to 5 minutes without shutting off spontaneously while running applications. It didn’t even get me through a 3 day conference. I am very disappointed in this product.",0
(Excelente compra): Muy buena elección calidad precio.,0
"(Buen equipo): Llegó antes de la fecha indicada, muy buen equipo excepto que no tiene una luz que indique que tiene el Mayus activo pero en general todo bien.",0
"(Exactly what we needed...): I'm the technology person for a very large HOA, and most of my computers are powerhouse gaming machines and the like, but our HOA's Sound & Lighting Department needed a good, solid little machine and this one is MORE than capable. (In fact, it should last for several years in it's current application.)My only complaint about ""brand name"" computers and laptops is the sheer amount of bloatware and branded software they include. I spend the first few minutes of setting up a new machine like this getting rid of all the fluff no one is going to use. This is not specific to this manufacturer, all brand names seem to do it now, guess they get kickbacks and referral money from the companies who own the software they bundle and want you to subscribe to.Overall this machine isn't some screaming super processor gaming powerhouse, but an 11th gen i5 is very, very solid for what this machine is going to be used to handle.",0
"(Great buy! Would buy AGAIN!): This is a great computer! It has a solid battery life, great resolution, and lightweight!",0
(Good laptop): The battery life for this laptop is amazing. It lasts me all day. The big issue with this laptop is that the clicker sometimes lags or does not move for a few seconds. It also messes up occasionally when scrolling. These issues occurred very recently after buying the laptop.,0
(Read the description): Opened the box thought every item was there only to find out that the mickey mouse cord for the charger was missing. How do you miss the most important part other than the laptop.,0
"(For Your Information Google Playstore Users): Having used the Lenovo Thinkpad, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, the Acer Chromebook and now the Samsung Chromebook 3, I know that the Chromebook is superior to the other devices. It is less ""touchy"" than the Thinkpad, which I found too sensitive to touch. It is almost the same size and weight as my Galaxy Tab 2, plus has the keyboard, which I LOVE! The Acer is similar but bigger and heavier...not benefits to me.I have one HUGE suggestion for anyone who needs apps from Google Playstore like I did. My device did not come loaded with the Playstore App but I had researched enough to know it was capable of using it. After hours of experimentation on my own, I finally called 1-888-891-0696. They gave me their Chromebook reps, who told me I had to call Google to get the necessary update. I called 1-844-613-7593 and was told that they used to handle calls regarding the update but they no longer do, so directed me back to Samsung. This time I called 1-800-SAMSUNG and got a rep that told me they are not capable of doing Google updates, only Google can. She happened to ask did I have any updates that needed attention on my device. Being new to the device, I wasn't sure, but she walked me through it and in fact I did. IT WAS THE GOOGLE PLAYSTORE APP that I needed!!! Problem solved! Just look down near your photo in the box for the update sign.Once I completed the update and downloaded the Playstore App, I was able to get the Brother printing app I needed, as well as others that I commonly use.Hope this review can save others from the initial hassle I endured because the Chromebook 3 looks terrific in any other way.",0
"(Píxel muerto.): Ningún detalle estético, en rendimiento es excepcional, pero cuenta con un píxel muerto en el centro mismo de la pantalla, no pediré un reembolso porque a pesar de todo funciona perfectamente, pero por lo que cuesta deberían de tomarse la molestia de testearlo al menos antes de enviarlo.El píxel muerto es de fabrica. aclaro.",0
"(Defective Wireless Card): This laptop worked for just under a month, and then the wireless card gave out. All of my devices, including my 4 year old HP Envy laptop are connecting just fine to my network. I've restarted, run diagnostics, and still nothing. It continues to say there are no networks available, which means that the wireless card isn't working, at all. It's not even finding other local networks let alone mine. Since this thing doesn't have an Ethernet cable port, it's useless now since I can't connect to the internet with it. Returned.",0
"(2nd computer. COMPLETE GARBAGE!): This is the 2nd Acer computer received from Amazon. First one was returned because battery was defective. Had this 2nd computer for approximately 10 weeks and had to factory reset. Computer was telling me that I was connected to my Wifi but couldn't sign in because no Internet connection. My Chromebook connected just fine. Spent 45 minutes attempting to connect to Internet, shutting computer off several times in hopes it would reset or something. Power button also was not cooperating, turned off fine, but needed several attempts to restart. Had power button pressed several times for 15 - 20 seconds waiting for something to happen. Usually took 3 or 4 attempts to start. Finally shut if off and walked away for an hour. Praise be, it finally allowed me to connect to Internet. I immediately factory reset, hoping this will fix the situation. I attempted to return this piece of garbage to Amazon, sadly couldn't. I understand this computer only cost $300, but all I use it for is email, Amazon and catching up on world news. Last laptop I had was also a $300 Lenovo purchased 4 years ago. It finally died. That 4 year old Lenovo laptop was better than this Acer. Wish I would have purchased Lenovo brand again. Nothing but regrets with this purchase. Christmas is here. If I find a great deal, $300 limit, on a Lenovo or HP I will definitely purchase and keep this Acer as a backup. Waste of money, waste of time. Two Acer laptops and both were garbage. Will never buy this brand again, and will always recommend against purchasing",0
(Strong laptop): When i use this item it does not work properly on battery as well as i use it with electricity but in general laptop is great,0
"(Mechanical issues): We've had this chromebook for less than a year and it has major mechanical issues. The screen will only display an image when it is tilted to just the right angle, if it is bumped or moved in the slightest way the screen will go blank. This is very frustrating and started happening less than six months after purchase. There are also problems with audio input for head phones where every once in a while there will be no audio and you have to reset the device in order to get any audio back on.",0
it’s light and compact build. Bezel seems to be strong so far and it can run most games well,0

"(I thought it would be great for no more computing then my husband does): quite small, and so is the font....I thought it would be great for no more computing then my husband does...we will probably give it to one of our grand kids going to college.",0
(Weak charging port): Computer worked well until the charging port bent from normal plugging and unplugging. Of course it’s not covered by the warranty and Samsung quoted me $200.00 more than I paid for the computer to fix it. Consider a different chrome book. Very disappointed,0
(Garbage): I bought this a year ago thinking it was top notch because of the numbers. It crashed. I bought another one just because I'm hoping to take the hard drive out and replace it to the new one and save my work.,0
the keyboard is confusing,0
(CD slot): Gift.,0
"(Research before you buy. - Updated 9/11/22): Overall this is a great laptop. It has handled everything I have tried from work to gaming. The problem with it is, I plugged it into my monitor using a usb c pass-through. It worked great and charged like it was plugged in directly to the charger that came with it. After disconnecting it and plugging in directly again, the laptop would not charge and kept showing message ""Please use original Asus charger."" It was connected using the one that came with it. The battery ended up dying and would not charge. I had to RMA it. Haven't received it back and and has been 2 weeks but Asus says they fixed it now. Others have complained about the same issue and Asus has replaced everything from the motherboard and battery to the entire laptop to fix the problem. Asus compatible plugs don't work either.Update- I received it back from Asus RMA. During the time they were fixing it, there was minimal communication from them on it. It took 2 weeks for them to return it and FEDEX kept delaying the shipment. The day I received it, the box was open partially but luckily Asus did a good job on packaging it. I had to really dig online to figure out what they had done to it. They replaced the MB, power unit and supply, and memory. Practically a new laptop. Out of the box reser it up and it worked but the performance was very poor. Freezing up and running slow. I used the system restore and it still had issues. I ended up going to Microsoft and downloading a fresh copy of Windows 11 from there and installing with it. That was a process as well because Windows did not see the hard drive during the boot to install. Once I finally got Windows reinstalled and My Asus and other software back on, it has been running great. I have not tried a second monitor again, too afraid to honestly, but I have used the second USB-C with my portable M2 drives. That works fine. It has been running for almost 2 weeks without issue now. If I could give a 1/2 star, I would move it up to 3.5 stars. Taking 1 1/2 away because you should not have these types of problems for a laptop that costs this much.",0
"(horrible to play on, lag machine, super loud, save up for a pc instead.): this thing is literally horrible, ive been grinding on this game and its on roblox and it literally cant run it, even on graphics 1, meaning pretty much no lighting, only a small chunk render meaning you cant see much over the distance, and you still lag so hard, the cooling is literally mediocre, coolboost barely even helps, can run halo infinite but might explode and noone likes halo infinite, so youre better off saving up for a pc. sure this thing is portable but its battery life cant even survive 5 chrome tabs open, so its horrible, sure nitrosense is cool blablah blah but who cares, if its horrible, this kids are going around and literally buying this thinking theyre gonna be the next esports or sumn like you cant even game on this bro, you wanna play valorant? okay u can run valorant any pc can run valorant but if u wanna play valorant go to your local library and steal a pc from there because itll probably run better than this steam can. gaming is literally like asking to borrow your moms work chromebook that has been through hell anf back and sure it has a 1650, okay a 1650 is decent but everything else is literally garbage, everything else is just a poorly choosen scraps to just fill up the name of the item so kids think its so powerful, Please BUY A PC AND BUILD IT, you have fun and learn stuff, think of it as legos, this acer nitro 5 is horrible. i can literally go search in my dads tool box and make a better ""gaming laptop"" obviously thats what they did in this case.",0
"(Was okay... I could see using it ...): Was okay... I could see using it for school. Just not what I needed, so returned. Ty Amazon for the fast refund.",0
(Four Stars): The computer itself is nice but it is slow as molasses. Not happy with the performance at all,0

"(Great Laptop BUT....): This is a good laptop and does everything that I want it to do. HOWEVER the battery life on this laptop is horrible. Within in hour of it running without being plugged in, the battery has completely died. It has been like this since I purchased in April/May 2022. Very disappointed that if I want to use this when traveling, it has to remain plugged in at all times.",0

The backspace after the first day broke.. and the repairman couldn't get it fixed. The graphics card studdered or something within the hardware was studdering once when I was play ESO. The boot-time on this device is very good. You can upgrade the SSD and RAM in the future if needed. It's a shame that my backspace broke on the first day, and that graphics studder scared me.I will update my review once I get a replacement.",0
"(Look for another): If you want to beat your head with a mallet, choose this laptop over it. I haul a storage drive, battery, and what not to make sure I play one game. I look like a lunatic the amount it takes to do a simple task on this thing. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more",0

"(Computer is great): Setup on this computer took less than 3 minutes. Super easy. I was a little nervous because the documentation that came with the computer was minimal - but that's all you need! I have a Windows background, but so far so good. Boot time and shut down is quick! I had some experience with Google Drive so all my documents and spreadsheets automatically showed up since they are in the cloud. The battery seems to hold a charge and for a 11.6"" computer, the keyboard is actually easy to type on. I do believe I'm hooked on the Chromebook.",0

"(Great purchase for my wife who does all her work on a Chromebook): This is really a high quality machine. The price I paid almost reflected that quality, but I snagged it when an incredible deal was running. The m3 processor is more than enough power to do regular tasks that anyone does online plus all the productivity work that is needed in a workplace. My wife is a teacher and this was purchased for her, so most of this feedback is from what she's said as she's used it.First, let's talk about the display. It really is a beautiful display with accurate-enough colors. It gets a little over-saturated in some situations and under-saturated in others, creating some awkward hue on backgrounds of darker movies or webpages. But those are only noticeable while objects are moving (or when you're scrolling) and there's a lot of action on the screen. It gets bright enough for most situations and in the previous Pro model I wondered why it got as bright as it did. Watching reviews it seemed like you almost don't need to use a lamp to lighten a room, just turn the display face up and turn it up; that should be plenty to light an entire bedroom.Second is the quality of the material. The device feels like a brushed aluminum or other metal material with some plastic in some places. This is about right for the price, considering an even better quality of material would get you easily spending $900+. The keyboard feels fantastic and the touchscreen hasn't had a single hiccup yet after about 2 months of use.Third, let's talk about functionality. And, before we begin, let's remember this is a Chromebook. This wasn't purchased to play the latest games or sync with Microsoft or Apple services. It's a Samsung product running a Google operating system, meaning that it's meant to work with Google services. That said, it works wonderfully for Google Drive (word processing, spreadsheets, etc.). This item is used almost exclusively to do lesson planning, grading, research, and other tasks that a teacher would do. For that, it's perfect. The only real issues we've had entail poor web design and a lack of websites switching to HTML5 instead of Flash.All in all, if you're wanting the performance of a Google Pixelbook and similar functionality then you won't be disappointed. If you want to get a loved one a computer that will really allow them to use the Internet without too much worry about viruses, then you're making a good purchase. If you're intending to get a laptop that can run Android apps without too much of a ""herky jerky"" experience, then you're making a good purchase. If you're wanting a computer that can run Photoshop, render 4K videos, or anything like that, then you're better off with other products.",0
(Warm and fast): It warms fast when is charging and the battery does not hold lot.,0
"(Great computer; only complaint is the touchpad): I got this computer for college, and it is perfect for me. The only problem is the touchpad is very touchy. Other than that I am very happy I made this purchase.",0

(Love): Great computer,0
"(Hot as heck. Needs a cooling pad.): We purchased this for our daughter in HS. It runs fine but a way too hot to run alone without additional cooling. It required us to purchase a cooling pad otherwise it would thermal throttle after any short usage. Not gaming, but just for word processing or watching YouTube. They really need to do a better job with the cooling. It runs with no issues with a cooling pad (those laptop stands that have fans in them) but really why do we have to do that?",0
"(College notebook): Bought this for my son. His first year of school was with a very old laptop that was more geared to gaming. He ending up hating that laptop when he needed actually needed it to be portable. But that allowed him to define what he really wanted and needed a new unit to do. He wanted a smaller screen (<15""), lightweight, longer battery life. This hits all those points, is quite stylish, plus more. It was expensive, and my major concern with it is that there is no replaceable battery. This travels almost like a tablet, but definitely feels like a notebook computer. He loves it.",0
"(Great little tablet!!!!! It’s not much bigger than my iPad Air but I love that it has a keyboard!): At first I was hesitant because it seemed too good to be true but I honestly can’t say a negative thing about this little Samsong! It is super light and easy to use. I was able to get mine going right out of the box and at this price I purchased a second one for my two-year-old to play on. If you are questioning whether to buy one or not, just go for it!",0

Make sure you search for lenovo thinkpad hdmi issues before you buy, and you will be sure to go elsewhere. Essentially, the HDMI is BRICKED from the moment you buy it, or it fails shortly thereafter.",0
(Its okay): Its okay,0
"(It's Legit But Gets Super Hot): All specs check out. The temperature on this thing averages over 80 degrees, which means this thing isn't built to last. It is very powerful and plays everything at 60 fps on Ultra, but it gets really hot (gets close to 100 degrees when gaming). I have a laptop fan running on high underneath this laptop and it still gets really hot. I even use it next to a portable ac blowing into it. Nothing helps keep it cool. In essence, yes, it's powerful, but trying to keep this thing under 80 degrees is a huge problem that will result in parts failure within a year; heck, even within 6 months. The battery life is terrible (2 hours on average). When you plug it in, that's when you have full power of the GPU or graphics card. When unplugged (using battery), the gpu runs half powered and is cooler, but with a 2 hour battery life, you have to constantly plug it in to use it. Most laptops I've owned have lasted over 2 years, but this particular one doesn't seem likely to even make it to a year with its heating issues. Considering the cost, it's better to game on desktop as you have more control/options for cooling than a pre-built powerhouse laptop.",0
"(So much better than a TV box.): I bought this to connect to my TV after having tried three Android boxes, which were all hopeless, and an HP Stream with Windows 10 which didn't even have enough memory to update itself. I finally got it right. This Chromebook (with an added wireless keyboard) is simple to use, incredibly quick and understands how to be hooked up to a TV without turning itself off all the time. Well worth the money.",0

(Five Stars): I love this computer. Very light and easy to use.So much happier that I back with Dell,0
"(Not A Gamer, Still Very Pleased): I bought this for multimedia applications while multitasking with several large programs.The size is perfect: I only rarely leave my desk so the larger screen and keyboard are much better than on the usual laptop. The robust size is more than worth the trade-off in quality output, including excellent sound. If I traveled constantly I might've gone a different route.My previous Asus could not handle live-streaming with other large programs open and average speed internet. The Predator Helios 300 handles it with ease!",0

(Good gaming laptop): This is a pretty good laptop for the price. It has run every game I've tried well. Would recommend,0
"(Refurbished but seems like brand new.): I got a refurbished model—because of price and buying this was cheaper than repairing my other laptop—for a trip where I just a mobile or tablet wouldn't be enough and am finding myself liking it much more than expected. The biggest difference is getting used to an OS based primarily on a browser, but the update which loaded shortly after logging into Google that allows for using mobile/tablet apps helps seeing as there are some things (like Discord or Hulu) which don't have a browser app and others (like Google Play Music or Netflix) that work better as an app than opening another tab in a browser window. I did opt to get an micro SD card to expand the memory. Battery works well, I get nearly 4 to 5 hours easily.",0
(The best computer i have ever owned): I'm no computer expert but i asked my brother for recommendations for a great computer for my livestream playing music.

THE SELLER PLACED A STICKER ON THE SAMSUNG BOX WITH THE IDENTICAL MODEL NUMBER FOR THE UNIT WITH THE M3 PROCESSOR, BUT THE BOX AND THE DEVICE CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THE UNIT CONTAINS A CELERON. THE PRICE IS NOT WORTH THE OLDER PROCESSOR!!!!!",0
"(This is a great little computer): This is a great little computer, runs the internet very smoothly and has access to any word doc. needs. The only thing that I don't care for is that it is incapable of downloading many applications due to the fact that it runs on the chromebook operating system. Again, this is a great computer, but not if you need to download programs to do homework/office work.",0
"(Delivers 100% on all expectations!): I researched gaming laptops for months before settling on the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin. I absolutely had to have a laptop with cutting edge graphics, SSD storage, more memory than I need just because and a CPU that could surpass any and all work load/gaming I could throw at it! I am an IT professional and have been in this field for going on 22 years now. I've been a gamer since about 1995 when I got out of the Marine Corps. My game of choice for the past 14 years has been World of Warcraft and I wanted for the first time to be able to increase all in game performance settings to the absolute maximum setting and still run smoothly and fluidly while still getting great frames per second. This laptop did NOT disappoint. I maxed everything out and I can see and hear things in game I always suspected but never was able to truly experience before without tremendous lag and choppy performance! Other reviews talk about the built in fans being loud but set on cooler boost they do get a bit louder but they are still very quiet in my opinion. This beast of a laptop also has not trouble with Overwatch on maximum settings across the board and it is a blast to play not to mention beautiful on this laptop. I was a little skeptical dropping the money at first but after a week with this laptop putting it through its paces I am very pleased to give it 5 stars with zero hesitation! My 15 year old wants one now and I may just buy him one for Christmas! Thank you MSI for delivering a magnificent gaming machine! I also use it for college course work and it is a true pleasure finally having a machine that I have to keep up with instead of the other way around.",0
"(Very usable, good performance): I love the trackpad, super silcky. Love the keyboard. The keyboard has good depth and feedback, and the layout is what I'm used to on my desktop.The screen is too reflective. It is fine in low light and when there is a white background (which there typically is in most apps). I do use the laptop outside, so it is usable, there are just times when the reflection is too apparent, and interferes with seeing the screen.It looks very sleek and feels very solid. When I sit in certain positions with the laptop on my lap (go figure), the edges cut into my hands or wrists uncomfortably. It doesn't happen often, but it seems very unnecessary to be so sharp.The performance is great. I have 25 tabs open right now with no problem and only 8GB of memory.",0
"(Buena): Apresar de que fue enviada por Amazon EUA llegó un día antes de lo esperado y en muy buenas condiciones. La computadora es buena, pero hasta ahí. Por los 10k que pagué estoy satisfecho para un uso en casa y/o de tipo oficina. La adquirí debido a la necesidad actual para que mi hijo pueda realizar su escuela a distancia.Es rápida por su SSD, aunque es de 128 y sólo tienes disponibles alrededor de 80GB está perfecto para la escuela u oficina.Enciende en menos de 10 segundos, teclado retroiluminado, varios puertos USB de diferentes características, HDMI. Los altavoces son débiles y con muy poca definición; podría decir que suena igual que el altavoz de mi celular pero, cumple para lo que se necesita. La batería tiene una duración aceptable dentro de 4-6 horas dándole un uso ofimático.Por 10k no pienso que exista algo mejor, ya que viene con un procesador Intel Core i3 de 10ma generación y 128SSD (80 libres, ya lo aclaramos).",0
"(Perfect): This computer for this price was a complete steal - it works very, very well, and I absolutely love it!",0
"(Terrible keyboard): I really wanted to like this Chromebook. Good price. Adequate (but not great) display. Long battery life. But the keyboard just kills it for me. Somebody in the design group decided to increase the key spacing so that the keyboard fills the entire space. It's terrible. The keys are much further apart than on my ThinkPad and my multiple mechanical keyboards. Trying to hit backspace just gives me ""="". I just can't manage to type on this thing.I wish I could find a good replacement for my old Asus Transformer tablet & keyboard. I was hoping a Chromebook would fill the bill, but I am very disappointed.",0
"(Doesn't come equipped as advertised!): Advertised to come with Windows 11. Comes with Windows 10. No response from seller. It's a decent laptop. Gets hot quickly and is noisy when trying to run video programs. Substantially slower with an ethernet cable ironically than with wifi. Not really what I paid for. I'll sell upgrade and not use this supplier again. It's very slow and takes a very long time to do some simple tasks for being ""brand new"" speaker quality is TERRIBLE. It crashes way more than I'd like. The supplier was not 100% honeat about this particular laptop.",0

"(All 3 USB 3.0 ports finicky, borderline unusable unless laptop is on flat surface- Any solutions?): One month after purchase, all 3 standard USB 3.0 ports started having issues. Devices plugged into the ports will disconnect unless the cord was oriented properly and precisely (possibly a lose connection?). I've tried disabling USB selective settings, checking the drivers, and even physically trying to tighten the USB ports by pulling the USB port clamps up with a screwdriver. None of it seemed to have an effect.The problem mostly has an effect on the laptop's portability as moving it about causes the USB devices to disconnect and reconnect. On a flat surface like a desk, this problem is pretty much solved, but devices such as my Oculus Rift S VR headset seem to simply not work as Windows 10 ""doesn't recognize this USB device."" Hoping to avoid returning it, so if anyone has experienced this please let me know and how you dealt with the problem. Thank you.",0
"(An Excellent Gaming Laptop that Covers Most If Not All Gaming Needs.): For a notebook sized laptop, this thing is quite the beast when it comes to graphical and processing power. Now I know it doesn't stack up against a prim and proper desktop computer that is built with top of the line components, but with the current economy and apparent chip shortages products like these will be in higher demand. Overall, it will run all of the games I want to play at a good resolution (1080p) at high or ultra settings at a stable 60 FPS.While this laptop for the price is an absolute steal, I needed to spend an extra $100 for it to truly shine. The SSD on this laptop is only 237GB which is dreadfully small if you're into gaming so be prepared to invest in a external hard drive in the size of your choosing. My monitor which is around 6 years old only uses a HDMI cord so I needed to buy an HDMI to VGA so I can connect this laptop to my monitor. Finally, this laptop also has two USB ports; one type 2.0 port and one type C. In order to connect my keyboard, mouse, and XBOX 360 adapter I needed to buy a USB hub that goes into the type C slot. In my opinion, while it might be a pain to drop another $100; in the end it was absolutely worth it.Now I have a list of games that I have played or tested that I believe may help any potential buyer decided on taking a chance with this laptop. Do note that I aimed for a stable 60 FPS and all are at 1080p.Yakuza Like a Dragon- Maintained 60 FPS on high settings.Witcher 3 GOTY - 60 FPS with dips into the low 50's on ultra settingsBattlefield 4- 60 FPS on ultra.Watchdogs 2- 60 FPS with dips into the low 50's on high/ultra settings.Doom Eternal- 60 FPS on ultra.Deus Ex Mankind Divided - 60 FPS on high/ultra.Fallout 4 (no graphics mods) - 60 FPS on ultra.Star Wars Battlefront 2 - 60 FPS on highFarcry 5- 60 FPS on ultra.Mass Effect Andromeda- 60 FPS with dips into the low 50's on high/ultra.Overwatch- 60 FPS on ultra.",0
"The GS75 is a very powerful laptop that is surprisingly light weight, it has strong build quality and it look good to be honest.",0

"(Outstanding Profile And Performance Versus Thermals Control): This laptop is elevated by its rubber feet 2 cm off the ground. This really allows more airflow to leave the laptop, which being an AMD system, gets hotter and uses active cooling more aggressively with performance. While this is a laptop that should not be used for long periods of time without an A/C connection, one can actually game at full performance for 4 hours consistently with both fans going at maximum. Thermal throttling takes quite a while (I could only get the 3050 Ti card to throttle after 1.5 hours of Doom Eternal at maximum settings).In terms of design besides the thermals, the laptop looks like a business class design with a couple of angles. This allows the laptop to fit into standard cases and backpacks.In terms of modification, this particular model has room for two M2 SSDs (including the SK Hynix supplied 500 GB) and two slots for RAM (2X 8 GB's of Samsung DDR4-3200 included in this laptop). Screw removal and replacement is extremely easy and no further dissembly of the motherboard is necessary to replace the parts.For someone who wants to game but still needs a laptop for work or light data science matters, the improved thermals and strong balance makes this laptop strongly worth recommending, especially at the price compared with other brands and components. While adding an SSD is a likely upgrade, the included parts are quite good and do not really need to be upgraded in place.",0
"(Overall great gaming Laptop): The original purchase of the laptop, the touchpad did not work at all. The return process isn't quite as easy as I still haven't even recieved credit yet and I ordered it the beginning of September. I had to order it a 2nd time due to work and after a week or 2 the charging cord fritz and stopped working. I had to work with Amazon who had to connect me with Acer which was such a pain to get a replacement charging cord sent. Now with all that said, I do enjoy the laptop for gaming and work. The start up is so seemless and the gameplay is flawless! I love the option to turn on the fan separately when playing a high usage game, and the customization of colors of the keys are a plus. I do also love the additon of the side number keypad as I occasionaly work with numbers and it makes it so much easier. I hope that the glitches I had in the beginning were just out of the norm and this will be a future proof laptop!!",0

"(Excelente opción para juegos con espacio para mejoras): Lo que más me gustó es que es ligera en peso y las capacidades son suficientes para juegos nuevos. Es muy rápida y prácticamente no se calienta demasiado a menos que se use al límite o en lugares con altas temperaturas. Posiblemente quede a deber en algunas áreas como la duración de la batería o la RAM y a algunas personas les puede parecer que tiene poco espacio en disco duro. Para los gamers dedicados puede quedarse corta en rendimiento máximo pero en general cumple.Las mejoras disponibles son: mejor batería, espacio para otro SSD de 3.5 o un M.2, RAM hasta 32 GB (A pesar de los límites del fabricante de 16 GB, hay videos en línea que han probado con mayor capacidad).Para dise?adores o editores de video puede que requieran expandir el espacio de SSD.",0

(Amazingly designed laptop - Not so good battery life): It's a very well made laptop by Asus. The design of it really peaked my interests and I could not stop thinking about having it in my possession. I finally have it but now the one thing that worries me is maintaining the quality of such a beautiful piece of machinery. I even worry about getting serious scratches on it overtime since I believe there's not much protective hard covers out there specifically made for a good computer like this sadly. It's my first 2k laptop and I can only hope to take care of it in the long run :).,0

It's fast, does everything I need it to do in a browser and the battery life is amazing. I get a full day of use out of it. I can leave the house in the morning, go to meetings, go to Starbucks and still have battery left at the end of the day. If you are a Gmail/G Suite/Google Drive user, everything is seamless in terms of integration.Keep in mind, you can't install software on this, however pretty much everything you need to do these days can be done in a browser, within reason.

It doesn't look refurbished at all, except for the added film of cover over the keyboard/touchpad area, which is to cover some wear and scratches I guess. But it blends well with the original surface. There are no visible scratches or damages to the external surfaces top and bottom of the laptop.

The only downside is the 500GB SSD (would have preferred a 1TB to start with), but I will upgrade it (and the RAM) at a later point in time. Screen and speakers are great.Battery life has not been the best, but this isn't designed at max settings so that's not a surprise at all.Can get fairly warm, but again to be expected given the components, and it seems to manage it well.",0

For anyone looking to play intense games like rust you will be amazed at how well it renders and plays!! Definitely on par with big desktop computers but with portability!! 10/10,0
"(Powerful, great value laptop): Overall great computer for the price. A few minor issues, but I am very happy with this computer as a whole. I bought this to replace an old Macbook, because I wanted something that could run powerful programs, games, and I could use in class. Overall a great general purpose machine that can do everything I want it to do. It may not be as exciting or sleak as my macbook, but for the price it functions super well and doesn't look half bad.Pros:* Great value: I bought the ""used - very good"" condition option from amazon warehouse deals with the i7/16gb RAM/256G SSD+1TB HDD. For the specs it has I couldn't find a cheaper computer. This machine is able to run anything I throw at it within reason without any trouble. I have never seen my RAM or CPU usage go above 60% even with many programs running at once (including some high powered ones like Engineering CAD programs).* Great graphics: I got the model with the 1050 GTX, and it works like a charm. For reference I can run GTAV on high settings at a consistent 60 fps, and PUBG on medium/high settings somewhere between 35 and 55 fps. Coming from my last laptop that had integrated graphics this is a huge upgrade.* Looks: I wanted a catch all computer. I wanted to be able to play games and run engineering programs without having RGB obnoxious alien ware everything. I also use this laptop in class and wanted to be able to carry it around and use it in professional settings. It doesn't look like anything special, but that kind of exactly what I wanted. I has all of the things you would expect on a laptop of this caliber (back lit keyboard, aluminum finish, etc.), but definitely doesn't compare on aesthetics to a Macbook or even some of Asus' flagship laptops like the Zenbook.* Charging speed: I read some reviews that said the charging speed was fast and that made up for poor battery life, and I was skeptical that it was really any faster than most laptops. It definitely is though.Cons:* Screen: I was hesitant about buying this laptop because of some of the reviews about the screen, and to be honest it isn't great. The contrast and color pallet are low, and the matte display is not exactly my favorite. It doesn't bother me for normal web browsing or document editing, but if I'm staring at the screen for a long time with low contrast content, like a dark movie or game, it can start to strain my eyes because of the low contrast. It's not a total deal breaker for this computer, but it is one of the major reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5.*Track pad: This may be just an issue with my particular computer, but the track pad isn't awesome. It works well 90% of the time, but 10% of the time it will lose responsiveness for a few seconds and then come back. It's not a huge issue for me because I use an external mouse most of the time, but I definitely notice the lack of quality in the track pad compared to friends Macbooks or other more high end laptops.* Battery life isn't amazing, but that is to be expected with such a high powered machine. I haven't tried optimizing for battery life very much, as I am usually near an outlet and have my charger with me. But I do know that I can easily get through at least 4 hours of regular use without plugging in. I though low battery life would be much more of an issue that it ended up being, and overall I'm happy with this.",0

(Unexpected durability.): I bought this for college and as well to replace the use of my desktop computer. It is large! The power supply is bigger than any laptop I have ever seen. It is a bit heavy as you would expect when you put it in your bag with a couple of books but not so much that your back will be hurting by the end of the day. Ive loaded fallout 4 and all of the mods I could think of on it and it runs without a single hitch. One of my favorite features is the button that turns up the fan speed on demand. The body seems to be made out of a durable brushed aluminum. It doesnt feel cheap or flimsy like most other laptops ive used.Cons are minimal. The touch pad is a bit too close to the keyboard so when typing I occasionally hit the touch pad.It is my opinion that this laptop model has the best features and performance for the money and I am so happy I went with this one. Look forward to having a powerhouse for gaming in my off time and something reliable and strong enough to survive being knocked around in a backpack.,0
(Great so fat): Great litte laptop so far,0
"(Not useful — buy a refurb iPad or other tablet instead): I’ve been meaning to try a chromebook for years. I really liked the idea, but now I know better.To start with, it has a 15GBhard drive, of which ChromeOS takes about 7GB. Yes, it has a MicroSD slot, but Google handicapped it with a recent ChromeOS update to where you have to manually drag files to it rather than using it to expand working hard drive space. So that’s not very useful.It does not play well with VPNs. It either ignores the VPN by routing traffic around it or it kills the connection until you turn off and on the VPN a few times. That’s a huge pain if you travel with it, which I believe is one of those things people claim to like about chromebooks.If you use Linux (I do) then that also takes an additional 5-7GB of the hard drive space, rendering the hard drive just about completely full, at which point ChromeOS “helpfully” recommends that you delete all non-Google applications.I also experienced a number of frustrating bugs and crashes in ChromeOS, which I found super weird because of Google’s pedigree. It seemed to me that ChromeOS wasn’t ready for production, which is strange because it’s been around a long time.My iPhone 8 renders webpages faster than this chromebook. My RaspberryPi 3 works better than this. I’m going to see if I can donate it. It has no use in my house.",0

"(Overheating is a serious problem with these models): ASUS changed their approach to cooling by placing a small vent on the left and right under-side of the laptop with a fan for each. The unit was also designed to allow it to run hot. However, this turns out to be a poor engineering decision because it makes them prone to clog up with dust and they overheat very easily. I have kept it clear of dust but even so I find that it runs extremely hot, and now, after just a year, I am getting blue-screens almost every day",0

"(Erroneous product information!!!): This model number, 81JW0001US, does not have a FHD (1920x1080) screen. The resolution of this model number, 81JW0001US, is HD (1366x768) which is absolutely awful for a 14"" screen.Lenovo does offer a chromebook S330 with FHD (1920x1080) resolution -- that model is the 81JW000EUS and is listed on their website for $279.99 as of 6/12/2019.It does not look like the FHD model (which also comes with 64GB of storage, not the 32GB listed here) is currently available on Amazon.All the above being said, if you know for a fact that you will not be bothered by the low resolution of the screen, this is actually a pretty good buy for the price. Lenovo lists their HD (1366x768) S330 for $249.99. I have the Lenovo C330 (same internal specs and screen resolution as this model, but with a touchscreen) and it can run android applications and output Netflix fairly well to a 4K TV.",0

"(Acer Swift 5 compared to Asus): Acer sf 514-55taAcer sf514-55ta- vs Asus ux435eFirst a disclosure: no one is paying me or giving me any inducement for this review. I am going to compare two very similar computers: the Acer sf514-55t and the Asus ux435e.After reading about both laptops, I thought I wanted the Acer; however, reviews on Amazon had indicated considerable dissatisfaction with high failure rate. Understand there is no way to know if these reviews are honest. Were people trashing this computer because they were paid to do it? In any case, it caused me to consider purchasing the Asus ux435e which I did. After using it for about 10 days, I decided it was not for me and returned it. I purchased an Acer sf514-55ta and have been using it for about two months and I am happy with it.The following are my observations:The Asus comes in a beautiful box which befits the computer itself which is beautiful to look at. If you have been looking at this computer or other similar Asus computers, it is difficult to know which ones have touch screens. This one does. The screen is shiny and reflective but the images are excellent. There is also a secondary screen in front of the keyboard which can be used as a secondary screen or as a touchpad. I found this annoying and delayed start up. Using the F6 key, you can change the function and revert it back to a touchpad. As such it is excellent. The sound from the speakers is weak; however, by boosting the equalizer it is possible to get loud enough, slightly distorted sound. The ports are adequate. The biggest drawback for me was the weight. This computer comes in just shy of 3 lbs.The Acer comes in a plain brown utilitarian box which befits this laptop as it not beautiful but a dull functional gray. (Acer talks about it being green and if you look at it in good light, the gray has a slightly green hue.) The screen is also shiny but less so than the Acer and hence less reflective. This computer comes with a fingerprint reader. The Asus does not. There is no secondary screen and the touchpad is just a touchpad. I thought the keys on the Asus were nicer than the Acer as the Asus keys have a subtle depression while the Acer keys are either flat or have a slight rise to them; in addition, the Asus keys are imprinted in white while the Acer keys are delineated in gold and harder to read. Both keyboards are backlighted, and the award goes to Asus as you can adjust the brightness of the backlight. This is not possible on the Acer which is also preset to turn off the backlight, a feature I found annoying. If you go into the BIOS – restart the computer and keep pushing the F2 key, you will enter the BIOS and from there, you can set the backlight function so that it does not time out. You then can turn on or off this function from F7; however, you cannot adjust the brightness. The Acer has more ports. Its charger is old fashioned, using a pin/barrel rather than a thunderbolt. There is only one thunderbolt and it can be used to charge the battery. The sound from the Acer is on a par with the Asus. The volume is too low and both computers present a tinny sound. Just as with the Asus, you can boost the volume by boosting the equalizer.Both computers come with an Intel 17 2.8 ghz processor, 16 gb of memory and 1 tb of a pce nvme harddrive. The video is different in each computer but as far as I can tell the screen image looks the same. So why choose the Acer over the Asus? There are for me three reasons: price – the Acer is at least several hundred dollars less expensive; the presence of a fingerprint reader for security and finally weight – the Acer weighs 2.2 pounds to the 2.87 of the Asus. That sounds like I am quibbling, but the Acer is noticeably more comfortable on your lap and if you are carrying a laptop with you all day, you will appreciate the lower weight. As far as durability goes; generally electronic goods either fail initially or they are good to go. Neither of these computers will survive a fall out of a fifth storey window.With the two being so similar in function and for me at two months no problem with durability, the Acer at lower weight and lower price seems like the better choice. Note this computer was purchased in June 2021. People who complained about this computer seem to have bought it considerably earlier.",0
"(Crazy Long Battery life, love the look): The screen was literally flashing the other day and I have had the laptop for less than 3 weeks. When I restarted the device it stopped. But definitely alerting. If it happens again I will contact Amazon and return it. Def will update the review as well.UPDATE: it's 2021 & I still have my laptop. Works great. No more problems and I just think it's worth every penny. I changed the rating to 5 stars too. Great buy.",0
"(A True Disappointment): I financed this laptop last month only to pay it off eighteen days later from moneys saved to purchase car tires. For several days it worked like a charm until it fell from a table onto a concrete floor with my Apple iPad Pro tablet. There were no scratches nor dents on my tablet; however, my NEW Lenovo Flex 5 took a serious beating! When facing the monitor, the left corner below the keyboard is permanently bent, and the frame has buckled on that side. The speaker still works, but it is now uncomfortable to rest my arm in that area. Yet, the product now belongs to me so I decided to continue using it to learn coding and to prepare teaching engineering to high school students this fall.Based on the published description of the laptop on Lenovo's official website, I figured it can handle The Sims 4 software and the three of its expansion kits on top of my education apps- boy was I wrong! Since loading the Sims 4, the Flex 5 takes longer to restart and to process commands. The quality went from a $650 Lenovo laptop to a $199 Dell Chromebook. A total disappointment indeed! The school district invested in a $1,500 Lenonovo laptop for my engineering courses; however, the weight is unbearable to hold in one arm after two minutes. The Flex 5 was going to work wonders due to having the capability to rotate the monitor behind the keyboard to convert it into a tablet. I just have to remind myself to remove the clear keyboard cover to prevent it from falling to the ground. The finger ID makes it convenient to log on; however, the processing speed is not what I expected. I should have waited and saved moneys to purchase another Apple Macbook Air, because my 2013 laptop fell onto concrete in the past and is still going strong without any physical damages.This purchase altered my perception of Lenovo by far, and I will consider purchasing a Samsung laptop the next go round. :-(",0

"(Don’t Buy This Laptop Used!!!!): Caveat: I bought this as “Used, Like New”.The box was damaged, which was mentioned in the description. After unboxing, however, I became immediately concerned when one of the screws was missing on the bottom cover. I was concerned because not only did it mean somebody had been tinkering with the inside, but they botched the reassembly job. Otherwise, form factor was outstanding and the overall quality and feel reminded me of a MacBook. After some initial login stuff that comes with windows 10, I next noticed that the battery symbol in the status window had an x over it. When I hovered the cursor over it, the text box read “no battery detected.” I thought, ok, well, this might just be a new boot problem. So I reset the machine and, good news: reboot time was faster than expected; bad news: the battery symbol was now saying it couldn’t determine the charge. Ok, I check the system status and the battery there indicated 100% charge. Alright, time to test, I unplugged the charger and the system stayed on... for about 10 minutes when, without warning, it shutoff. And I don’t mean like it went into some sort of sleep mode after warning me about the low battery, I mean it weant straight dead.That’s enough for me. My best guess is that the previous owner had the same problem. Probably sent it back or resold it or whatever where somebody else opened it up, did something to the battery, and closed it, of course missing one of the screws, leaving me a juicy clue as to the real reason it was being sold used.For consideration... I’m planning on buying the same laptop, this time NEW. Again, form factor and speed were impressive. But a laptop with unknown / dysfunctional battery charge status? No thank you.",0
(Easy to use not too expensive): I love the laptop just sucks that I would of had to pay a lot of money to have everything that you really need to have installed on a computer installed. Otherwise perfect especially for my son to do his homework on.,0

"(A lot of laptop for the price!!): I love this laptop: PROS: many features including 3 USB drives, DVD-RW and two card readers, it latches closed, the superficial blemishes are minimal, came with W10 Pro and the price. CONS: larger and heavier than most.I was a little surprised that none of the drivers were installed, but once I figured it out, the installation went smoothly. Love the feel of the keyboard - it's quiet and it has a backlight. It was delivered before I expected, and it was well packaged. I would recommend this seller, Olive Computers, without hesitation.",0
"(Best power to dollar ratio you will get): This laptop gives you the most power per dollar you can find right now. With an i7 10th gen, and RTX 2070 for under $1500 you really cannot beat that. The screen is good, crystal clear. Thermals are a bit on the high side, but they have fans to compensate for that. The fans get LOUD, but that doesn’t bother me. If you game with headphones you won’t even hear it. The one significant issue is the placement of the power cord, right in the middle of the right hand side. If you have a cramped table space it does get in the way of the mouse.Overall you are getting an upper mid-range gaming laptop for a lower mid-range price.",0

"(Nice upgrade from 2017 MB Pro): I bought this base model Macbook air M2 to replace a 2017 Macbook Pro 13"" with an Intel i5 2.3 and it is somewhat snappier in performance. Menus and webpages open faster. The keyboard has a better feel to it than my 2017 MB Pro. The magsafe charge connector is far better than usb c. The finger print reader is a bonus for logging into APPS and websites. I bought the Starlight colour and glad I did. For those of you who said in your review that you bought startlight colour Mac but got a silver one....you probably got startlight colour. It's very hard to see that there is a hint of gold in the colour until you sit it beside a silver Mac. I bought the base model with 8gb ram and 256 gb HDD because the bulk of my use is web surfing and I don't store many photos or videos on my Mac. Battery life is a lot longer than my 2017 Intel i5 MB Pro. When using this Macbook Air M2 for web surfing, the battery dropped only 10% after 1.5 hours. Overall I'm happy with this MB Air M2 and would recommend this base model for the average user. Buy yourself a nice sleeve or other accessory with the money you save by buying the base vs upgraded M2 Air.",0
(Liviana y cómoda de trasladar): Un buen producto,0
"(Nice overall laptop): There is a lot to like with the laptop. The build feels solid enough. When you lift the lid, I don't feel any wiggle between the screen and the frame. It's heavy and solid. The power adapter is definitely a beast.Screen is great. Nice and bright. Easy to read.The keyboard is nice as well. Large enough. Plus a ten key. So good for overall use if you use the ten key. I don't but I know that some people really prefer it. Especially if they're not gaming. The lights on the keyboard are slightly distracting but can be adjusted.I think this is a good overall laptop, even for business. As a desktop replacement, it's got enough power to get the job done. For gaming, there's always something more powerful around the corner but this is good enough to get the job done.",0

(Touchscreen failed after 7 months): PROS:Great Value/price ratioI have enjoyed used it and performance is great- fast and seamless use of windows.CONS:Touchscreen stopped working suddenly after 7 monthsLenovo service took 1 month to service the computer- terrible auto service web siteUpdate: Even though Lenovo replaced the screen- it failed again after 2 months- now out of warranty and using as a laptop without the touchscreen- frustrating. Not buying Lenovo again.The power connection and headphone connections are next to each other. Way too easy to connect your headphones to the power connectorOn/Off bottom on the side- when handling the computer easy to turn it off inadvertentlyToo much fan noise- can get hot (unlike Yoga 710),0

"(Perfect for students): I have used this computer daily now for about 6 months, spending hours per day on it for an EMT/paramedic class. I haven't added any apps to it or done anything other than log into my online portion of school and complete lectures, so I can only speak for its basic tasks.It's extremely fast and has very little lag when opening pages or surfing the web.(*cough'Quizlet'cough*) I use this hooked up to my mobile hotspot from my cell phone mainly, and it allows me access anywhere I have cell service. At school my cell service sucks so I have it set to automatically connect to Wi-Fi and it works great. The size is perfect, it's easy to toss it in my satchel or backpack along with my textbook and notebooks and have plenty of room. I use the Amazon basics sleeve to protect it, and use an electronic mouse to help perform tasks a little quicker. It's highly recommended that you purchase an SD card for this to store any documents etc., as it doesn't have large built in memory. I feel this computer is perfect for students who don't want to carry around a large laptop and add more weight to your already heavy backpack, but can still perform most of the same tasks as the larger ones and do the majority of school work you need to do. I highly recommend.",0

"(Lightweight & Fast): I like the size of this computer. It is lightweight. There is no touch screen. I purchased for work at home position and does a good job of keeping up with many programs open at one time. Battery life is an issue as it does not give you the full eight hours as described, I’m only able to get half that battery life. I purchased this so that I could have my original HP worked on with additional memory and Bluetooth. I think this one will work fine until that is complete. The keyboard is great and I love that it is raised. This far it does what I need. I absolutely don’t like that you have to log into Microsoft to set up. I also do not need the app feature and find that most laptops and windows are going that route. It’s annoying. Other than those issues, for the money it is thus far doing the job.",0

"(Fantastic Gaming Laptop Under $1500): At a time and place where standard video cards are running $1000+ for halfway decent ""value"" cards, this laptop delivers everything it could for less than $1500. Was a desktop replacement for my son, who has it hooked up to a 50"" 4k display at 60Hz without any issues (It 'should' be able to run 120Hz, but the TV doesn't support it) The insides to upgrade hard drive and memory are generally speaking not very easy to get into and in practice, they really don't want the consumer to do it themselves, but we upgraded ours to 32GB and added a 1TB NVMe drive to the system and it's really set to do anything he needs for quite some time.",0

In fact, it works perfectly with the exception of the occasional scrambled Youtube or Facebook video (To play those videos I have to downgrade the video quality). So I thought it would have been a good idea to get the same or better for my sister so I bought an Amazon refurbished Nitro. When I actually got the laptop, it would not turn on or charge and I had to returned it. Then I bought a new one and as luck would have it, it's the same situation. At this point I'm not getting the impression any of these laptops are working and I don't think I'll purchasing anymore of these on Amazon.",0
"(Overall, kind of a letdown): This product is originally listed for $549.00. Sure I didn’t pay that, but this product is in no way worth the listing price. I wish I would have gone and gotten one with a bigger screen too. Overall, it was kind of a letdown....",0

"(SO FAR SO-SO): This laptop was purchased to replace one purchased in 2013. I was not unhappy with my 8+ year old machine, but disk access had slowed down with fragmentation, and the battery needed replacement. The attraction of SSD and price made a device change the only rational choice.I found removal of current files from one device to the other unreasonably unaddressed in the product supporting materials, or in the guidance I sought from the most prominent purveyors of system and communications software. I am still in the transfer process. This is disappointing.",0

Didn't know until I was diagnosing the sluggish startup. Now I have to reinstall Windows 10 on the M.2 NVMe and reformat the 5400HDD. What a noob mistake from the tech department.

"(GREAT BUT HAS ITS Flaws AS ALL THINGS DO): This is gonna be short and sweet. It hasn’t given me any issues while gaming, producing music, and just surfing the web. The processor is definitely a step up from what I have and I plan to keep it here. The only CON I have is that when you unplug this guy gaming is not the way to go. Keep it plugged in for the best results while you’re gaming. Everything else works as normal but gaming lacks as soon as you hit about 30% 40%It fits perfectly with on my set up which is constantly growing as it is.

This is not correct, the screen is not 400 nits in brightness, it's 300 nits. It's a mediocre panel, certainly usable, but the false information is a really big negative.

"(Riddled with problems): I have had this Dell XPS 9500 for six months and it's a disaster.This is my third or fourth Dell laptop and both this one and its predecessor (a Dell Precision) have BIG problems. The biggest problem is that the battery swells. As you can see in the photos, as the battery swells, the touch pad starts to lift up and you can no longer click on it. Eventually the whole front of the case separates so you can no longer properly close the computer. More importantly, this is extremely dangerous because if the pouch of a lithium ion battery ruptures it will likely result in an explosion. This is totally unacceptable and never happened in the other brands of laptops I used over the years.Second, with the Dell XPS 9500 I have had frequent problems with the screen going mostly black, and I have to push down on the screen or wiggle it to get the screen to come back up. A Dell service person said they fixed it by updating my drivers but the nature of the problem (and the fact that wiggling the monitor makes it come back to life) makes me think this probably isn't a driver problem. Only time will tell (I just had the drivers updated a few days ago).Third, the headphone jack doesn't work. It only had hissing and static, and then I had an in-home Dell service call and they replaced the bottom of the computer and now there is no sound from the headphone jack at all. On top of that, the person lost three of the screws from the bottom of the computer and only screwed in one of the other five about halfway.Last but not least, this computer was chosen for me by my employer and when it arrived I discovered it only had USB-C ports -- no regular USB ports. Since all of my peripherals are USB (microphone, mouse, tablet, ring light, MIDI keyboard), I have to use an adapter dongle for absolutely everything, and the dongle won't power the MIDI keyboard. It's beyond frustrating.All in all, this computer has been way too much trouble and I'm going to try to have my employer return it and I will avoid Dells until there is some evidence they have solved their quality control problems.",0

"(Fire hazard.): This was my first gaming laptop and because of this thing I will never buy another one. I used to play on a PC but had to go to college so I needed a laptop and didn't want to bring a bulky tower to my dorm. I thought a gaming laptop was a great solution, a little extra money but I could still game so it would be worth it. This laptop works great as a heater in the winter, as long as you don't put it against your bare skin. This laptop got so hot turned the clear lacquer on a wooden table white.

A cooling pad is a must have but even then I've never been able to ANY game at anything above Medium-High graphics at 45 fps without being afraid of melting my processor. Don't buy.

"(Needed a fast laptop for Computer graphics so I could work/travel away from home. Plus big screen.): I recently purchased this and have only had it a few days. I already have a nice desktop workstation that I purchased in 2018 for computer graphics and animation work. I do some gaming, but not really my reason for purchase. I needed a laptop with similar performance so that I could travel and work away from home. I needed the largest screen available, which is 17.3, and also a good amount of ram with a good video card. I finally chose this Sager for it's good value and it seemed to check off the boxes for a strong package. 17 inch screen, 32g ram, RTX 2060 6bm graphics card and I got the 2 -1TB SSD card option for a bit more money. I paid extra for the faster shipping and received it within 3 days. It feels like a solid laptop and good quality. The keyboard feels high quality and the buttons have good feedback and solid feel. I use a usb wireless mouse so I can not say much about the mouse pad function on the laptop, but it seems very good and I like the feel of the left/right mousepad function keys on the laptop. After the usual windows 10 bootup steps it was up and running nicely. Took me a while to get it loaded with all my work programs, but seems really fast and comparable to my desktop workstation speed. I am now able to work on some computer animation projects away from home and travel if needed. I did also buy a laptop cooling pad with fans. I did try out ""The Witcher 3"" pc game with full graphics and the laptop definitely switches on the fans and heats up. The cooling pad is an extra layer of peace of mind to keep things a bit cooler, but maybe not totally necessary. If you play games a lot, then get a cooling pad. For my work the fans do not kick in that open, except for when I need to playback larger scenes in real time. Over all I am happy with my purchase so far and the speed and quality seems good. Reliability remains to be seen with more time under the belt, but hoping for the best.",0
"(Not as good as the Acer 13): I got an Acer 13 about two years ago and was looking to replace it with something newer. Unfortunately, I'm finding the 15 much less functional in several aspects.- First, the keyboard seems smaller than the 13. The keypads stick more and overall ease of typing is reduced.- Second, the screen quality seems to be worse. Although it boasts better graphics (and may actually have them), print ends up looking more pixelated on this machine.- Finally, the buikier size is not worth the larger screen. The Acer 13 is lighter and more easily fits into an over-the-shoulder bag. It's more useful for client meetings, and feels lighter on the lap as well.Overall, I'd go with the Acer 13 over this model if you're considering both - unless you're going to use the system primarily for gaming or video/movie watching--in which case the visual graphics and better speakers might be worth it.",0
(Love the size and price and good computer !!): Love it !!,0
"(Linux ready): Every thing works in Linux. When I got it I first tested on Linux live OS and checked all the drivers. Then after testing for a week I decided to commit to it. First I wiped the Windows OS which I never use and made the Linux OS perminant. Then I properly assembled the unit with proper thermal paste on processor and added thermal tapes on other components. Now I get 16 hours on Linux while my laptop always stays cool, quiet and stable. I charge my laptop once every 3 days or 4. Excellent laptop but you have to fix it once it comes messed up. I had to do the same to XPS 15",0

"(Great laptop for hardcore gamers): I purchased this laptop, a little over 4 months ago, and have been running it daily for at least 8 hours/day. Here is my opinion on it;The Good: a very powerful i7-12700H laptop that runs all of my games (No Man's Sky, Empyion Galactic Survial, and Eve Online to name a few) at maximum video settings without so much as hiccup, video editing performance is really good thanks to the RTX nVidia 3070 TI and 32GB of Ram is more than what is needed, the 17.3 Inch QHD 165Hz screen looks great for streaming movies or YouTube videos, 1TB Gen4 NVMe SSD is a good amount of storage, the case is solid but light in weight, (6.3lbs), good for easy transportation, great cooling and design.There are many more things I can write but you get the idea.The Bad: the fans. When starting a game, they become quite loud, I wish it had more USB slots, priceOverall, I'm happy that I bought it. I have yet to see any problem. If your a gamer thinking about purchasing this game crushing machine, I highly recommened it. Score: 9.75 of 10",0
(Worked according to his reviews): My son loves it. It does everything he wanted from his reviews.,0
"(very worth the money): for 200 bucks you cant beat it. I have used mine for about 6 months now and love it. love that it's small, simple, and was not expensive. works fast, has great battery life, and does what i need it to do. needed a quick purchase without doing a lot of research first to have something for travel and job applying and am very happy with this purchase. only 4gb of memory, yes, but I bought a 64gb flashdrive to keep everything on which was only like another 20 bucks. First chromebook ever and only second laptop of any kind ever and love it!",0
(Doesn't Work): What a horrible product. Got the laptop and would not even turn on all the way. Screen would blink and laptop would shut down.,0
"(Buyer Beware): This is a good laptop for kids who dont need to download applications, I had to return mine the because it comes with something called ""S mode"" so i couldnt do my work on it because i was unable to download the things i need!",0
"(ASUS TUF Gaming F15 (2022) problem with the TOUCHPAD): I bought this laptop for gaming and overall general home use. But the touchpad corner-click doesn't work at all when physically pressed down. Left and right mouse click gestures still work however, via single and double finger tap.Never had this problem with any of my previous laptops going back many years.Anyhow, I never realized until now it was a problem because I had been using it with a regular keyboard, mouse, and monitor from the beginning.So to continue: Diagnostics via the MyAsus app found no issues. No change after updating Windows. No change after resetting the laptop and reloading base installation of its software + drivers.An RMA with ASUS was approved and I shipped it in for repair. However, I received an update that the repair is delayed to COVID. huh, really. So that is my experience as of now. Wednesday, Aug 17th, 2022.",0
(best purchase ever!): it arrived very well and quickly,0
(Happy Customer!): 100% satisfied!Fantastic value!,0
"(Look no further): Amazing laptop with beautiful graphics and plenty of power for any game you want to throw at it. I have ran halo, splitgate, FIFA and madden all with smooth refresh rates and amazing graphics. Do not look elsewhere. Well built machine with great battery life. I bought this over a razer blade 15 and don’t regret it.",0
"(Economical): I'm not very tech savvy so I just like to open the thing and have it work and then don't do too much more than check accounts and social media and shopping. So I bought something from Target for like $200 and just could not get it to work or connect with a network and returned it the next day. This is a pricier unit obviously, but you still need to spend a certain amount to get anything more than a typewriter. I've always had success with Dell and there's nothing to figure out after you turn it on. Sure I'd love to spend a few thousand to be in the Jobs cult, but that seems like overkill to write a couple of book reviews and order a new pair of boots for work.",0
"(Great price and perfect for a student): This is way cheaper than buying a laptop. I bought this as a gift for my son, for his classes. He already uses an Android and has Google Play and a Google account. So, this was an easy transition for him. He says the keyboard is a little ""funky"" but when I asked for more details-- I think it's just learning to work with a new keyboard. He is really happy with his Chromebook.",0
(Great Laptop): Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Said it was all she needed for her last year in college Battery life is awesome.,0
"(Skip, too many problems): So when I got it, I used it primarily for programming at first. But found that my network connections kept dropping but only when using wireless. Took it apart to find that 1 of the antenna cables wasn't plugged in to the card. What a pain to disassemble. Took it with me on a business trip and tried to play some games on it, ALL of them + my 3d modeling CAD software close after about a minute or so in game with no error messages (even debug logs show an external closure). It's consistent, nothing seems to fix it... fresh install of video drivers and even a full factory reset. Support has been responsive, but thus far, their responses have been generic and unhelpful.EDIT: Support has told me to RMA but I have to cover the cost of shipping... From Alaska. Last MSI product I'll ever buy, and they used to be my preference for Motherboard and Video Card purchases.EDIT 2 1/1/2019: Just got it back from a *2nd* RMA... came back saying ""Customer problem, reinstall OS"" which they already did.. and I had already done at the direction of their tech support. Oh, and the problems still persist.Edit 3 4/5/2019: So this laptop has now been sent back to the manufacturer 4 times. It came back from the manufacturer in ""working condition"" but experiences: BSOD related to bad driver installation, constant freezing (likely due to said driver).. a factory image does nothing. The Windows image is botched so it will not take a direct install of DirectX drivers, requiring workarounds just to install it. There is also a permanent ""smudge"" underneath the glass within the screen on the left third. While games no longer randomly force close, now, the entire laptop just freezes up. Glad to know $2500 was wasted.",0
After several weeks the caps lock stopped working generating random upper case and lower case letters when typing.,0
"(Es lo que buscaba): La entrega fue en la fecha acordada, la laptop es increíble",0
The fingerprint recognizer is amazingly good and fast,0
"(Doesn't always use the correct graphics card for every game): Its OK for gaming. When it uses the right graphics card it works great, but there are some games I've noticed that are choppy and somehow its using a completely different graphics card. Not all games allow you to choose the graphics card you use in the settings. Extremely weird. Never seen anything like it.",0
"(Great Laptop BUT the SPEAKERS are horrible!): Before purchasing, I read the reviews and thought how bad can the speakers be?The SPEAKERS are horrible! Constantly trying to adjust to every video. Volume turned up to 100% and still sounds like 40%. I really have no other complaints. If they fixed this issue, I would buy a second one.",0
"(Excelente equipo): Excelente producto y de buena calidad, rápida, liviana, excelente diseño, pantalla delgada, la recomiendo, no se arrepentirá la persona que la compre",0
"(Velocidad, hardware reciente): Gran velocidad de encendido, carga, ejecución de aplicaciones. último hardware en procesador, memoria, video, disco. Teclado impecable, marcos diminutos, ligera de peso, amplio touchpad, teclado numérico incorporado con mínimos marcos en la base para tener el máximo espacio posible completamente aprovechado.",0
"(Slow processor, freezes, and turn on unless connected to a power cord.): Honestly, I would not recommend this product to anyone. I have nothing but issues since I’ve opened the box. The computer I got will not turn on unless connected to the power cord even after it’s been charged. I downloaded the free Microsoft office that comes with the computer for a year, which is really nice except for the fact that it freezes this computer every time I try to open it. I would not recommend this to anyone, it is too slow.",0
"(lasted 14 months): Today our Samsung XE520QAB-K02US Chromebook Plus V2 stopped working. I purchased it August 2019, it lasted 14 months. While it was working my daughter liked it... Problem appears to be with the charging unit because when I plug it in for a few seconds I see a blue light but then quickly goes to red. I was able to force it into recovery mode briefly. Then back to blank. Very disappointed it did not last longer!",0
(Excelent): Excelent and beautiful laptop for gaming very fast I recommend it,0
"(Screen quality): Perfect, good quality",0
(Impressive for the Money): My Granddaughter Ava is in College and Loves Everything about this Laptop 💻 Screen Qualityeverything about it is Top Notch …… Would Buy again,0
"(Quality components for a steal): This computer is an absolute steal. I spent another $100 to add a second hard drive, but for the price of this computer with an 12th gen i9 and a RTX 3060, I don’t mind one bit. I’m able to run all of music production software and vst’s without noticeable latency. And it still can run games like COD Warzone and Rainbow Siege without a sweat.",0
"(Ideal for College Students Who Game): This is a very good laptop pc used for gaming. Since it's my first I do not have much to compare it to, but mostly everything satisfies me.Good:It runs very quick with today's modern games. From GTA V to Cities Skylines, I have no complains to how it runs. The bootup is also good, only takes a couple of seconds. Screen is ok too with displaying colors, again, nothing to complain about. The best part is the service. The first laptop that arrived was defective. The screen was fuzzy upon startup so I needed to return it. After contacting Amazon they had me return it. The problem was that meant I was out of a laptop for a few days. However, they allowed me to purchase another laptop and wait for that one to arrive before I returned the other one.Bad:It's very loud, especially when you play high demanding games. This is good since the computer won't fry, but headphones are almost a must. The battery life isn't all that good even when I'm not running games, maybe a couple hours tops. It smudges easily by fingerprints all around also. It is kind of heavy and thick, which may serve as a problem for those wanting to fit in a lot of cases.Verdictit is a great choice for someone who needs a portable laptop that wants to play games for a low price. While one can build a PC for cheaper, this comes in handy for the college market.P.S. I made this review after having the laptop for a few months.",0
the pen holder takes up a USB port and blocks other ports.,0
"(Great product for a great price): I was hesitant buying a MacBook, I said I'd never do it. But after having my iPhone for so long I and my most recent laptop dying, I figured I could take the chance. I love it, it is basically just an iPhone in laptop form. I will miss Microsoft Office Suite, but I don't really need it for that so it is ok.",0
The screen is fantastic.,0
"(Great computer): I like how easy it is to set it up and how light it is,use for going on Internet",0
(Great product): Great product. Working fine with no problems. Will definitely recommend.,0
"(audio doesnt function properly): the audio on this PC has a mind of its own. it connects to my air pods when they are closed in a far away room. during zoom meetings, it will randomly stop working and i cant hear anything. the camera is not to clear either.the two finger scrolling is not too great either. again, on some days it will be ok and then on some it will start scrolling when im not even touching it!other than that it is ok, for normal computer functions, but not worth 600$",0
"(Very good laptop for work): Great laptop for work. It could run most games on low or medium setting. The storage is limited, but it is usually not a problem for me even though I have many large files. The battery is around 7-8 hours if you keep it only medium brightness, and you are using the internet. It will last around 4 hours when gaming. It charges very fast and is as light as a MacBook. For the price, it is probably better. The graphics are nice, but the camera is not very good. However, for the price, it is probably he best work laptop you could get.",0

(Best laptop for the price!): Best laptop ever for the price,0
"(Great laptop): This system is performing as promised. Red dead redemption looks beautiful on the display. The price is amazing. Very simple to add a SATA drive for more space. While adding a second drive might as well add more ram, extra slot for that as well.",0
(Love it!): It is everything I wanted in a laptop. It’s easy to use .All you have to do from the box is open the lid and your up and running,0

(All): No memory,0
"(No Compromise Laptop at $1000): When I went into a $1000 laptop I felt I had set myself up for pretty low expectations. In the past affordable laptops had underclocked quad cores, and weak low power gpus. Thanks to Zen, this laptop actually cooks. The 4800h is comparable to to a Ryzen 3700 desktop processor and you certainly feel it. On this laptop Multitasking feels smooth like a desktop, and rendering almost feels the same (ram upgrade necessary). The 1660ti has no problems at all running games at ultra settings on the 1080p 144hz screen, while you likely won't hit 144fps to fully saturate the screen I never felt uncomfortable with the frames this laptop is able to produce. The computer only came with a 512gb SSD but, with the smaller battery there is an additional 2.5"" space made available and adding a 2tb basic spinning disk this computer really became the no compromised machine I was looking for. With this laptop I can go out of town, and not miss my $3500 custom desktop too much! I really don't feel like I lose much on this device when I have to switch on the go and that's the best review I can ever give for a $1000 laptop!",0
"(Problemas con la Leonovo legion 5): Problemas con la Leonovo legion 5, esta lapto se apaga sola desde que inicia el WINDOWS no sirve!!!, se intento hacer un formateo para restablecer y aun asi la PC se sigue apagando... se determino una falla en la bateria que crea corto y se apaga, lenovo no se have responsable 0/5 de mi parte.",0
(Not powerful enough to connect to a gaming monitor): This is in theory an amazing gaming laptop because of the Graphics card but when try to use it with a monitor it lags so hardbig recommendation if you plan to play only with the laptop monitor.,0
"(Super small, powerful laptop): I use an XPS 17 as my workstation. For going places though, this super small laptop can do everything I need. It has 2 Thunderbolt 4 ports (USB C) and a micro-SD card reader. I use the reader with a 1TB micro-SD to store all my reference files. This makes the 512GB SSD more than adequate. My XPS 13 has 16GB ram which is more than enough for the purposes for which I use this machine. My only wish is if one had a 5G option so I would have to use a Hot Spot connection. The 1920x1200 display resolution is perfect. The XPS 13 is too small to really use 4K properly and battery life on 4K laptops is significantly less than these HD+ machines.",0
"(Dope.): Thing is fantastic. Display, great. Gaming, excellent. Battery? Best bet is to use it while its charging, otherwise, it's pretty mediocre. Regardless, great laptop 9/10 :D",0
"(Tthe laptop is cool most of the time): Pro:Tthe laptop is cool most of the time, the thermal control is really well, the SSD is blazing fast if it comes with a Samsung SSD, if you install a MAC OS, I believe it will defeat Apple MacBook Pro easilyCon:It comes with some Asus bloatware, the fan noise is very noticeable, even when the laptop is not heated up at all, I only open a few taps on my chrome browser, its fans spin up with a freaking loud and annoying sound, it's hard to be acceptable in a quiet room! I installed the BOIS driver 303, and I did not see the problem get resolved significantly, I think it has something to do with the poor vent design!, the bezel is not that thin, and I cannot flat the screen and fold to the back as a tablet version.like XPS, there is no 4K touchscreen option. not sure about the ram spec, it's soldered, you cannot replace a faster one yourself, also the wireless card is not very good, it has a weaker signal strength reception compared to other counterparts.",0
"AMD's integrated graphics are also surprisingly good, especially considering that you get it for free from the processor.",0
"(Not touchscreen, not even touchPAD): Item description was inaccurate, but I convinced teen (and veteran Chromebook user) to give it a shot. Unfortunately the touchpad became unresponsive less than 24 hours after first power-up. Subsequent restart & reset failed to correct the problem.We're returning it.",0
(Charger quality is not good): The charger became defective in less than a year so I was forced to buy again.,0
"(Id highly recommend this laptop if you are looking for a laptop ...): Bought the laptop around November last year as my old laptop died (RIP to my number one solider). Ive always been a fan of MSI but never actually owned any of their products. 7 months in to owning it and it has proven to be such a reliable laptop for every game i play ( league of legends, CSGO, PUBG, Fortnite, Fifa 18, Hunt: Showdown etc.).Id highly recommend this laptop if you are looking for a laptop that can hold up to most games without giving you issues.",0
the speakers occasionally don't work without headphones unless I shutdown and restart.,0
"(Battery doesn't last long and the worst is the customer service of Lenovo): ?DON'T BUY! After many reviews in YouTube I decided to buy this laptop for its performance at an affordable price but none talked about its poor battery life. It lasts three hours max and it is a pain to plug it so often... I called customer service and they recommended to download an optimizing app but the outcome is the same. I actually screenshoted the chat with the support in Colombia (where I live) and he actually says that the battery has only 4 cells and that is the reason why it lasts no more than three hours. He also mentions that the warranty doesn'y apply because I bought my laptop in the US :( .... other thing that I don't like is the low resolution camera and that the jack doesn't support microphones, it is only for headphones :s. On the good side: the laptop is light, I like how the keyboard feels and I love the colors on the screen. But in overall I regret changing my old Dell Inspiron Gaming for this.",0
(I saved $100 with Amazon!!!): This little puppy gets the job done at half the price of the bigger one. Great deal from Amazon.,0
(GREAT MACHINE for the price): so my thoughts are on the M1 air version and I must say its a great machine for the price it's my first apple device as I'm a pc gamer but I had to have this because of the ARM chipset being that it surpasses a lot of x86 chipsets it's very impressive the battery life is by far the most impressive thing about it...nothing at the moment beats the battery life it's great it has a great IPS display as well looks very vivid and sharp,0
"(Garbage): Used it for an apk, and one app. Crashed after 3 months... Very unhappy with product",0
"(Got the 7 GPU model despite different description): Nowhere was it mentioned that this is the castrated 7 GPU Core version. Feeling deceived. In addition, the 8 GB RAM / 256GB SSD Version is nigh useless for anything beyond websurfing. Having multiple apps open concurrently almost immediately yields the spinning beach ball of death. With a regular set of apps, like the MS Office suite, the disk fills up in no time. Now OS updates are not working, since they require at least 15 GB disk space.

The only problem with it is the keyboard, without full light over it you can barely read it and it is not backlit, the letters are etched over silver keys, very hard to read them. I had to buy a desk top lamp to use the laptop. Other wise, a very good laptop.",0
"(Broke right after warranty expired): I purchased mine and about 6 months after warranty expiration of course it breaks. Then you call them and they want almost 50% of what you paid to get it sent back and get fixed, I'd recommend a different brand as dell/alienware do not produce quality products nor do they stand my them.",0

I contacted support and they got it replaced since it was under warranty but again after few days there were issues with charger and support didn't respond this time when I tried to contact them and had to bring a new charger on my own expense.

"(The worst Mac I’ve ever owned): I’ve owned Mac’s for over 25 years and this is the worst I’ve ever owned. First off, the mouse buttons are a new horrible design that often do not recognize mouse clicks. Clicking this mouse is the worst experience I’ve ever had on any computer before. My previous 2018 Mac was much better in so many ways.Also i hate that this new Mac only has 2 ports both being USB-c. One is used to charge which means you only have a single USB-c port for use. Another huge downgrade.Also this Mac has the fancy new fingerprint scanner unlock and yet it forces me to re-enter my password constantly. So what is the point of a fingerprint scanner if i still need to re-enter my password 80% of the time?The keyboard also feels cheap and is very uncomfortable to use, another downgrade from my 2018 Mac. Literally this thing feels like a massive downgrade in nearly every way.",0
"(Very fast business laptop.): I like the I/O on this laptop. there are plenty of options. I was looking at another competitive product but the ports were lacking compared to this, it had the last generation AMD ZEN2 cpu, onboard AMD graphics, smaller less bright lower refresh screen, and was about $200 cheaper.

"(Turn Off S Mode or Get a Pricier Machine): I am not going to lie, with decent SSD memory, 8 gigs of Ram and the i3 processors (not the high dollar i5 or i7), I am pretty happy with my less than $400 purchase. If you are looking for a ""Chromebook"", this machine is a little deceiving at first. It comes with Microsoft Windows 10 operating system in ""S"" mode. If you want to keep it in ""S mode"" that's fine; however, I think that ""S mode"" simply makes it impossible to utilize Google and other apps on a device that has the capability to do more. I turned it off on day two and I have been happy with my machine. If you aren't willing to fart with Microsoft monopoly ""s mode"" crap, I would recommend buying a Chrome book for about $100 more. I think this is a good machine with a lot of potential, but I also think ""S mode"" is stupid. It isn't safety and security that they are marketing with ""S-mode"", it's creating division and preventing free market apps unless you turn it off or elect to change operating systems.I have owned this machine for less than two weeks and I like it. I had to change mouse setting and play with that ""S Mode"" stuff, but overall I am satisfied with my replacement computer after using the same machine for 10 years (MacBook Pro). With a large family and a tight budget, I am happy with my purchase so far.Update: a little over a year after my purchase (conveniently after the warranty expired) the mouse buttons broke on the touch pad. Not great.",0

"(Great gaming laptop for the price): I got this laptop over a month ago and I'm very impressed. Handles everything I throw at it like a dream. Thermals are pretty decent as well. The 144Hz screen is nice and smooth and is of good quality. Biggest plus is the that the 2070 in this laptop is a 115W instead of a Max-Q 85W so the performance is exceptionally good. I definitely recommend buying this laptop. Only ""Gripe"" is the battery life, but considering that it is a gaming laptop with powerful components, it goes without saying that it's gonna suck through the battery because of it's powerful internals.",0
"(Beautifully engineered): We opened it up to install RAM (it runs happily with 40 gigabytes!). I have never seen a cleaner, more straightforward design.

"(Great Gaming Laptop): I’ve had this for a couple months now and it’s very much meeting my expectations. I do some gaming but I also write databases and some other functions on this. This far the only very minor inconvenience I have is the noise when the fans kick on, but with the cooling it needs to do for the components it’s reasonable. I wish it had a touch screen, but that obviously was not a deal breaker. Having never used an Alienware computer before, I can honestly say I’m impressed. Makes me wish I had invested more into them earlier in life",0
"(Perfect for University): My daughter was very stoked about this one. For University, it is thin, light, and small. Perfect for a backpack and a powerhouse little performer!",0
(Not wireless printer friendly): I don't like the fact it is hard to hook up to my wireless printer. I'm still not hooked up to my printer.,0
(Zero chance I will ever buy an HP again): The absolute worst laptop I have ever owned. Non stop problems with this piece of junk. Absolute waste of time and money.,0
"(is good computer, i like): is a good computer, its good size, the keyboard is take time to get used to especially the function keys but you do get used to them quick, it runs games very good. battery, idk how it should be but i get like 2 hours with no windows open. back to the keyboard, its kinda not good. the keys bottom or nice but they still don't actuate, they need more force than it takes for them to bottom out so they can actuate which is not good if you are half asleep taking notes in class to find you are missing entire words. the camera quality is fine, so is mic, touchpad quality is not good. it feels like standard plastic touchpad but refuses to work half the time. it runs minecraft fine, powers through genshin impact with good settings, forza horizon 4 at high ish settings at 60fps and gta 5 at medium settings on 1080p, but cyberpunk it start to really struggle. in my experience, low settings in 720p give you good fps. vr runs great, except for when it doesn't, half life alyx needs the low settings. speakers are kinda quiet, and are for some reason pointing down towards the table instead of forward or up which for a laptop sitting on a lap, is a waste of sound and you gotta crank the sound up to max. hdmi is good. is a fine laptop. 9/10 i like, it turns on, it does basic math, it is computer. i like the 2 m.2 slots for storage expansion to allow for boot drive and storage drive. and it starts up really fast, like chromebook or macbook. until the bios decides to reset itself and i have to go in and specify i do not want ""rst premium with optane"" i want ""ahci"" so windows will boot. still is good computer. wifi is slow but that's expected, wifi is always slow.",0
"(Black screen of death, weak battery life): Like another reviewer, I got a black screen after about 3 weeks of light use. Amazon tech support was wholly unhelpful, and reaching Acer tech support was taking ages so I decided to return it since I was still within the 30-day window. I did quite a bit of research on the black screen issue online, and this is apparently a common problem with Acer machines. Either the monitor drivers are messed up, or the bit that ""plugs"" the monitor part into the laptop comes out. Either way, I was not willing to compromise the warranty for something that will likely happen again.While the machine worked, it was fine but the batter life was definitely under 12 hours, and despite it having an SSD I did not notice it being particularly fast, especially considering the fact that it was new and had hardly any data/programs/documents on it. Overall, a disappointment unfortunately. I went with Acer because I have had an Acer Chromebook for 5+ years that is still going strong but now doubt my commitment to this brand...",0
"(Not a bad deal): Laptop is great I upgraded the storage and added ram. Ram needed is 2666 ddr4 260 pin sodimm, and for storage the m.2 slot will it 2280 and any 2.5 hdd.",0
"(Good quality): Miss my Dell touch screen and backlit keyboard. Otherwise, decent quality.",0
"(it doesn't scream 'gamer' if you change the backlight): Unlike a lot of gaming laptops, this one doesn't yell 'gamer' with garish RGB lights, as long as you change the keyboard backlight.",0
"(Love this laptop!): I was in the market for a new laptop and knew I wanted something reasonably powerful with an AMD processor. This checked all the boxes and wasn't too heavy or big. I also knew I intended to upgrade the storage and memory straight away so I wasn't too picky about the M.2 or memory configuration.That said 16GB of memory is solid for most things you can do although I have no idea about the timings it is running in dual channel so speed is optimized right out of the box. I purchased 64GB of Corsair Vengeance SODIMMs (2x32GB) with CL20 timing and they worked right out of the box with no issues whatsoever.The disk space at 1TB isn't fantastic but most people could probably get by with this and be just fine, I produce music on the road and also play games to pass the time. I ended up purchasing two 2TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus NVMe drives and upgraded the C drive to 2TB and added a 2TB D drive as well. This isn't for the feint of heart as it requires you to reinstall Windows 10 and to reinstall all of the laptop specific/platform specific drivers. While it's not too hard, it's not a beginner friendly option. I can't comment on the performance between the stock NVMe drive and the replacements but I can say it boots insanely fast and run extremely well.I also upgraded Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro with a legitimate pro key from Microsoft for $99 on their website. I know you can find cheaper keys but I really don't trust them and anyway $99 isn't soul crushingly expensive and I like the peace of mind I get knowing it's completely legitimate and I won't ever have any problems with it. This process was smooth and super easy and took all of 5 minutes to complete.The keyboard on the laptop is probably the best laptop keyboard I've ever used, the key travel isn't much but it's tactile and a little clicky. I love mechanical keyboards so it's a nice touch here and the keyboard doesn't feel the least bit mushy like some laptop keyboards can be. I also must say the LEDs are bright and look fantastic. Though I can't help but feel Asus may have gone a little overboard with the RGB you can turn off unwanted RGB elements so I can't really complain about it and it looks amazing in the dark.Laptop thickness and weight is just fine as well as the overall dimension of the laptop and it's not bad lugging through airports on using on planes. My previous laptop was a 17"" and I wasn't in love with the size or weight. 15.6"" seems spot on for a laptop you intend to take with you everywhere. It's also extremely solidly built, there's no creaking or weird sounds coming out of the mechanical bits of the chassis and the hinges on the screen are extremely supportive and when typing the screen isn't jiggling around. You put the screen up and it's rock solid and that is fantastic as far as I'm concerned. The numeric keypad on the mouse track pad seems OK but I haven't really used it for much but it does function well enough though it kind of feels ""gimmicky"" to me. My only hardware gripe is I wish it has a couple more USB ports but that's minor as you can easily add a hub. I haven't used a laptop with a ""mux"" (I think that's what it's called) switch but I like that the laptop uses the built in graphics when it doesn't need all the power of the 3080 which helps with heat and power. If it gives up a few frames in a game I'm personally OK with that sacrifice to get more time when on battery.I can't comment on any bloatware that might come installed on the laptop as I removed the original 1TB NVMe m.2 drive before I even powered on the laptop and upgraded as stated above. I do however find Asus Armory Crate and Aura Creator lacking. The laptop stats screen is great and informative, but I feel the color settings are clunky and either lacking in much customization options, or overly complex in Aura Creator. With regards to Aura Creator it's apparently extremely buggy and I can't actually apply a custom created color which is annoying I get an error doing this. I don't like Armory Crate on my desktop and apart from the laptop stats page, I don't like it on my laptop either.",0

Will try calling Acer support but buyer beware: make sure you buy a warranty through Amazon to cover your buttEdit: Changed rating from 1 to 5 stars as I was able to use the hardware warranty through Acer without a problem. It was actually funny because their support team over the phone knew exactly what the issue was.Overall amazing laptop and has worked without a hitch ever since sent a new one.

(HP 15s-fq2000 Product #4x6F6UA): Media Tek MT 7921 WiFi 6 802.ax adapter does not consistently start from the sleep mode. Every 3 to 6 days it goes dead. Same condition happens with both 2.4 and 5 GHz. It can be recovered by completely powering off and turning it back on. This might have to be done a couple of times. The driver version is 3.0.1.1167 and is the current driver per HP's web page. The laptop works OK with a Cat 6 internet connection. A UNI USB C to Ethernet adapter cable is required as well as a Cat 6 cable direct to a router port. An extra expense to keep it running. This is a workaround till I can find time to work with HP. I would like to install a new wi-fi adapter.,0
"(This thing rocks!): This thing is great! I bought the 4GB model which will hopefully last me a few years but it's nice and snappy now. The 16GB of SSD storage is perfect as I use it for school and the biggest file I might be storing would be a picture. It integrates perfectly with my google account! This thing boots up super quick and it sleek and beautiful. It's lightweight, has a long battery life and although it's smaller than a standard laptop, the keyboard is easy to use.Google and partners have done great with Chromebooks and have plenty of features to accommodate. There are multiple physical keyboard shortcuts running along the top of the keyboard to quickly adjust settings. There are also several different hotkey menus which are accessed by keyboard combinations.The only thing I'm bummed about is the lack of Google Play. I'm still giving this thing 5 stars because the Play store should be released soon as it is already available on other Chromebooks.I would highly recommend this to anyone, but especially to someone wanting something that is affordable, easy to use and just a bit more than a tablet.UPDATE 7/21/17 - STILL ROCKSI've gotten more use out of this thing than I first envisioned. I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 and can easily access my Google Drive files that I create and edit on the Chromebook via Goggle Docs. It's still nice and snappy; I have Amazon Prime music running in one tab, working on a Google Docs file in another and browsing Reddit or searching something on a third tab and there's no hesitation. I've enabled the beta build and enjoy several Google Play Store applications. I added an SD card which has expanded on the 16GB of storage. I'm getting very used to the multiple finger shortcuts on the touch pad when navigating Chrome. For instance: putting 2 finger tips on the touch pad and swiping left or right will act as the forward or back button. Also, ""clicking"" on a link by using 2 fingers and pressing on the touch pad, you bring up a menu to open in a new tab among other things. I watch Netflix and HBO Now and can definitely notice the lack of 1080p but it's a ""get what you pay for"" situation, and I knew that going in. This thing is still fantastic for what it is. If you want a proper laptop then buy one -- this is a Chromebook. I'll be back to give another update in a few months.",0

The battery is really impressive when only using the internet and basic spreadsheets.The fingerprint lock works nicely. You can use a pin, or your fingerprint, and you can add multiple fingerprints once you verify your pin.The laptop has not run hot yet, and remains silent.The backlit keyboard is so nice to have when working in a dark room.My only wish is that it had a cat6 port. Yes, I was able to get an adapter, but I didn't even think about that and it can be helpful to connect to the internet that way, as well as printing directly to a printer.Overall, this laptop is a HUGE improvement over my old one.",0

Within a few months the keyboard key symbols started to scratch off. Now the right fan buzzes and needs to be replaced. Sure, I could send it off to the Acer support center for repair, but I only have one computer, this laptop - I just need to live with it and watch this thing rapidly fall apart, unfortunately.",0

To boot, the customer service is horrendous.I sent my computer (under warranty) to be fixed by Acer for the many issues that arise within a year. Be warned of the following:- They will not pay for shipping to their repair center (about $70).- They will likely void your warranty. In my case they stated my computer had ""physical damage"". This physical damage was a small scratch and bend on back cover of the screen (and has nothing to do with the repairs needed).- They will charge you a $386 fee to repair your computer (more than half the price of the computer) and offer no option for refund instead.- The customer service phone line will hang up on you, put you on endless hold, and redirect you in circles to different departments.Do yourself a favor and buy from a better company. I tried finding a cheaper option from my previous Apple and this was the biggest mistake and downgrade I have ever made with a laptop.",0

"(Read my review. Do not look any further!): I don't really like writing reviews, but I know there are people out there that are hesitating about purchasing this HP Chromebook 14. I'm telling you now that you will not regret it. Trust me when I say that I did so much research on Chromebooks before buying this laptop and it was so hard for me to decide. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to do much on the chromebook. I had an HP Envy dv6 running Windows 10 before I purchased the HP Chromebook 14. It was 15.6 inches and heavy, so I avoided taking it to school at all costs. I'm a college student and finals week is coming up, and I really wanted a light laptop I could carry in my backpack. After hours of looking into Chrome OS, I gave in and bought the HP Chromebook 14 (the 4gb one). It arrived safely and on time. As soon as I powered the laptop on, the chrome logo came up and all I had to do was sign into my Google account and everything was set up already. This laptop is beautiful. I purchased the silver one, and if I want to add some color, I'll probably just purchase some skins later on.I usually use my laptop to video stream, web browse, and create/edit Word documents. I've been using this chromebook for a few days already and I have had no problems at all. Youtube, Netflix, and Hulu run very smoothly. The screen resolution is 1920x1080 HD and it looks absolutely beautiful. The screen is a matte finish which prevents glaring if you're in the sunlight. I have no complaints at all about the screen. The brightness is amazing. Absolutely no complaints here.Web browsing on Chrome is very smooth. It's the only browser I have used on all computers I come across. All my bookmarks are there and I'm used to how it works, so it's very easy for me to manage my chromebook. I was worried my chromebook wouldn't read my USB flash drive, which is where all my homework and school stuff is saved on. I plugged it into the laptop, and it popped up in the ""Files"" folder. Everything ran smoothly. I can create and edit my homework documents through the Chrome Microsoft Word Extension. Everything saves automatically. If you don't like using the Word extension, you can also use Google Docs. I'm just used to Word and it's what I feel most comfortable with.I don't own an iPhone, but I do have an iPad mini. However, I don't really need to plug my iPad to a computer for anything, so I wasn't worried about the fact that Chrome OS doesn't support iTunes. I have a Samsung Note 4 and I was concerned that my chromebook wouldn't recognize it via USB. It didn't work on the USB ports on the left side of the laptop, but it did work on one USB port that's on the right. I found out that's the one for data transferring (USB 3.0). I can transfer files from my Note 4 to my Chromebook without a problem.I have had a pleasant experience with my HP Chromebook 14 these past few days. It's really good for multitasking. I'm currently writing this review while Pretty Little Liars is playing on Netflix in another window (No lagging :)). I forgot to mention the battery life is great! I used it a whole day without having to plug it in! Definitely a plus. The only negative thing I can say is that there is no backlit keyboard. My old laptop didn't have one either, but it doesn't really bother me because I'm used to it. I'm very happy with my Chromebook. I just bought a case and it's arriving in 2 days. I can do homework and watch Jane The Virgin, and I'm okay with that! I definitely recommend this Chromebook if you are like me and are looking for a laptop that can do basic things like web browsing, video streaming, and homework all at the same time.",0

"(Pretty much worth the price!): This is the second time I bought a Helios 300. The previous one is the 2018 version, compared to these two not only it remain a cheap price, but also it gets much more well-designed. For example, its size is smaller, making it easier to carry, and I can add one more PCIe SSD. Looking forward maybe 2 or 3 years later Acer would make a laptop with this much upgrade!",0
"(Beautiful, light weight and sleek design.): I was desperate for a new laptop as my previous one died right in the middle of an exam for nursing school. I needed something quickly, but I wanted quality. I did a quick search to find out what I should be looking for in a decent affordable laptop and this checked all the boxes. I am so happy with my purchase. Setup was a breeze, it took maybe 5 minutes, and maybe an extra 5 for the updates. The picture is crisp and clear, it has great sound, the keyboard is very comfortable and easy to read. I purchased the windows 11 version and have no regrets. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it has a thumb print reader for security and easy sign in. With the exception of heavy gaming, I can't imagine there is anything that the average user wouldn't be able to do for work or for school. I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend it.",0

"(Nice little laptop!): I was in a tight spot with money but desperately needed a computer to cover the basics in my life. I was so afraid of making a bad decision, but I bought this chromebook a month and a half ago and I'm really happy with it!I can do everything I need to. Writing, going on social media, watching youtube videos, photo editing, etc. I haven't had any problems with functionality, and I personally really like the keyboard.It's a light, compact laptop I can bring anywhere, without feeling like I'm going to break it in half if I hold it wrong. If you're looking for a cheap chromebook, I do honestly recommend it.The only downside is the screen is a little... light? I have chronic dry eye so my vision is always slightly blurred and I would love an option to change the contrast to something more stark. The screen definitely gets *bright* enough, but black seems a little pale on white. But for all I know, this isn't something other people notice.",0
"(No, no, no!): I really loved this laptop...for all of maybe 36 hours. SO disappointing! I used it quite a bit and then suddenly it wouldn't power up. Just nothing. I knew the battery was charged. Contacted tech support (who were very helpful) and they told me to press a couple of buttons simultaneously. Did that, nothing happened. A few minutes later they told me to try again and it worked. Ridiculous for a new computer! In the process of doing that, the #6 key popped of onto the floor. Really? They contacted Acer and I was asked if I wanted a replacement or refund. I shipped it right back. Not worth the hassle. I've had a dozen computers over the last 20 years and NEVER had anything like this occur. Do NOT recommend!",0
(Great for school): Perfect for my middle school student,0
"(Good buy): Coming from a Asus fx505DT I can say this laptop blows it away especially with the new I7 12th gen compared to RYZEN.The boot time to windows was legitimately 2 seconds the fastest computer I’ve had (with video).Triple A games you can run on all ultra settingsI would highly recommend this laptop it’s a great price for what you’re getting, and I’d highly recommend to buy the upper trim model with the I7-12gen and the 16GB of ram it really helps in gaming instead of having just the 4 cores in the other model you get 6 cores plus 4 e cores",0

I will let it sit for a week and see if it'll start later..if it does I will update this review. I have had a different chromebook for at least 3 years and it's still working. I did like the HP because it had a touchscreen which made it nice for my young daughter to do school lessonsUPDATE...so it wouldn't charge or do anything..backscreen..but I still saw a red light near charging spot..so I just put it in my closet for a few weeks or so..let it totally drain until I saw no light at the charing hole...I plugged it in and sure enough it turned on..good as new...I gues this is an old fashined reboot..luckily i had my old good chromebook of another brand that is sill going strong strong...but I'm happy it's working again..I've had several other devices through the years that I've fixed the same way :) hope this helps some people cuz I see many others with the same issue,0

"(Best priced budget gaming laptop on the market): Laptop was packaged very nice, little bloatware, few updates to do right off the bat. Some Amazonians received a ""Chinese only"" Windows version, I did not.Out of the package the laptop looks great. Not super flashy, overall its aesthetically pleasing. When you open the lid you are met with a well designed Steelseries Keyboard. The laptop has a large palm rest area, almost too big imo, they could have spaced out the keyboard a bit better. I dont use laptop touchpads, but this one is one I would consider keeping my mouse unplugged for while web surfing and youtubing.Performance for the price is tough to beat. Beefy i7, little skimpy on the RAM only 8GB DDR4, easily upgradeable. Has the nVidia GTX 1050Ti 4GB GDDR5, the screen looks great no bleeding or anything, most laptops in this price range have just the 1050 or even lower specd GPUs. Also has 2 drives, a 128GB m.2 SSD which houses the Windows 10 OS, very speedy, I would buy a larger 2.5"" SSD to replace the slow 1TB.I havent pushed this laptop yet, and I dont really plan on it, I have seen other users on youtube get the CPU up to 91C, so it may get too hot for your lap.Battery life is going to be atrocious, and I fully accept that, I plan to stay plugged.I am very pleased with my purchase of this laptop, for the price and specs, I dont think you can pass on it.",0
(works well): household,0
(Love it.): Great laptop for a great price. Fast. Worth it considering the gpu shortage.,0
"(Something basic. Nothing fancy.): It's perfect for someone like me who doesn't need a big, fancy setup. The screen quality is fantastic for the price.",0
(Great for the price): It’s a slim computer. Visually it’s great. Screen quality is perfect,0
(One of the best laptops for be price): The laptop is powerful and came in looking brand new for $250 you can’t beat it,0
"(Buena opción calidad precio): Es una laptop de plástico sin embargo no se siente nada mal al tacto el teclado no es tan bueno pero es pasable, tiene poco almacenamiento, para los juegos competitivos esta bien pero si quieres jugar los de nueva generación no creo que sea la mejor opción, para emular Wii u está bastante bien pude corre Zelda Botw a 30 fps a 720p. Los programas cono matlab, SQL server, NetBeans y los productos de Office corren bien y fluidos a pesar de tener muchas ventanas abiertas . En general es bastante buena opción para un estudiante de ingeniería en sistemas con posibilidad de jugar algunos títulos a buena resolución.",0

(So far so good!!): So far so good!!,0
(Great Gaming Laptop): This is an amazing laptop for the money. I've been looking for a gaming laptop that can handle VR well and this machine is perfect. I have an Oculus Quest and use the link to this machine and has had no issues up to this point. I would recommend this laptop for someone who doesn't have the space for a full gaming PC but is looking for some great performance.,0

(Trouble with sounds.): After 2 months. The sounds on my Acer laptop does not work anymore.,0
(Good quality): Perfect for my first grader!,0
(Super nice): These are perfect for online school this year!,0
"(Fast, easy to set up, convenient): Acer computer is efficient, quick, and easy to connect to the internet. Support help is available. The user manual was not included as described in the write up, but the computer is like new in original packaging.",0
"(Great laptop at the moment with something): The laptop is very good but it has that problem with the frame of the screen that is not right, but otherwise it does not make noise and it does heat up a little but it has a lot of power so far from what I have tried",0
(Light leakage. Will return): Serious light leakage on display. Not comfortable when playing at nightPerformance is not as good as other models tested by media. 15% lower than other RTX2060,0
(No instructions): Where's the instruction book.,0
(Five Stars): Great product! Love it,0
(All the goodies!): Heavier than I thought it would be. Fit and finish is very good. I like it!,0
"(Incredible Laptop.): I cannot say enough about how awesome this laptop is. The screen is crisp, frame rate is phenomenal and the gameplay is incredible. The keyboard works flawlessly and the RGB is beautiful. The speakers are ok, but mostly game with a headset. The 16GB of ram is plenty but will ultimately upgrade to 32gb or 64gb in the future. This laptop pretty much ticked every box for me. I only wish the battery life was a little longer, a sacrifice for the RTX 2070 performance. I knew this ahead of time and as I am not planning on leaving the hose with it very often it will work amazingly plugged in. The only other thing I wish it came with was a 1TB SSD, I filled it rather quickly with games but for $1400 you really can't ask for much more.",0
(Great addition to work computer): Love the portability of this. Just getting used to the different processes from former computer.,0
(Buyer Beware): Product was defective and not as advertised.,0

(Acer CB3-532 no longer supported): I have this Acer CB3-532 and was just informed by Google -3/8/22-that they will no longer support my computer after June 2022 -Its to old?,0
"(Hate the keyboard......): Trying to type this now on a very awkward keyboard. Everything else seems to be OK so far. Easy set up and battery storage seems good -- only one week of using. The tiny keyboard in the middle of a huge plastic expanse is really difficult to use. No ""end of line"" key and some random keys across the top of the keyboard with no explanation of what they do (???) I don't have touch screen capabilities",0
"When I playing game, this laptop provide a beautiful display and good sound quality to me to enjoy",0
(Five Stars): Great product and quick shipping!,0
"(Could have been great!): To be transparent - I bought the 14 inch version of this, same specs but a Ryzen 3 processor (comparable to this one). Initially, there was a problem with the screen dimming so much when I tried to work from the battery the laptop became virtually unusable. After a 25 minute call to ASUS, the problem was fixed. However I realized that in fixing it, I lost the battery icon and had no way to know how much battery I had left. That necessitated a second call to ASUS. Once we completed that call, the original problem of the screen dimming was back, so I called a third time and finally got a fix (had to go into the bios again). Was it worth the hassle - time will tell, I've only had it two days. As of now, it is sufficiently fast for basic office applications and for online activity. I do not do gaming and suspect you'd want a Ryzen 5 processor or better for real gamers. The speakers, which are located on the underneath and both sides, are just fine. The backlit keyboard is nice. The charging cable is really flimsy and I don't know why they would skimp there. It feels like it is well-built and it is attractive. If it hadn't been such a hassle, I'd be more enthusiastic. As it is, it is perfectly fine for my uses but I am still considering returning it, although I don't feel like starting the whole process over again. I'm cooked and don't want to have to think about computers for a long time! I knocked one star off for all the hassle, otherwise, for the price I paid from another vendor, it was great.",0
(So far so good.): Screen is big.Everything works.,0
"(Excellent laptop. So I bought two.): Purchased for grandkids, largely to write Scratch programs. Excellent laptop all around. Good keyboard and display, quick, light weight, easy setup, WIn 10S (easily converted to WIn 10). Also purchased a 64GB microSD (useful), wireless mouse (useful), wireless keyboard (not needed), and laptop sleeve (not needed). If you put Documents on the microSD, 32GB is plenty, unless you need a lot of space for additional apps.",0
"(Worst Buy): I’ve had the PC for little over a year now and it’s already giving a “No Bootable Device,” error. Before that the PC would get hot fast. The keys turn off in under 30 seconds. I would have thought it’d last at least a few years before I had to get a new one but you get what you paid for. I would recommend purchasing a better PC from different seller and manufacturer.",0
transfer rates were excellent as were launch/use.,0
(Top budget gaming PC): I5 is minimum for some games but this laptop is still speedy! Cant beat the value for the price point.,0
"(day one): day one everything working perfectly, amazing machine.",0
"(One year in with last year's model - this thing runs like a champ.): I have one model earlier than this laptop, and it has been almost exactly 1 year since I bought it. I bought this laptop because I needed something cheap that I could use for 3D work on the go, take into meetings, etc.This is a really fantastic laptop if you want a good price for great performance. In its unused time, I have been running it 24/7 constantly calculating BOINC calculations for the SETI massive parallel computation project. This is a killer calculation that is very hard on computers, maxing out both the CPU and the GPU simultaneously. My Macbook air overheated and totally died after just a few months running like this. Two of my desktops also choked on it. This laptop, though, gets really hot, but just keeps on going!Performance wise, it has been great for just about every game I have played on it. It's pretty close to desktop level performance. I also was running the Oculus Rift with it (on a GTX 1060 card) without issue, so the newer model with even upgraded specifications should be great for such tasks.Reliability wise, it's just kept on going. It has be very dependable.It's a larger laptop, so maybe not for everyone. It gets hot in use, and it is really hungry for power with a quite short battery life. It's enough to get through a meeting, but if I'm the presenter I will always bring my power brick.I cannot speak for their tech support / service, as I never had the need, which I guess is good.We bought several others for folks at my work, and they have all been running great as well, as far as I know.Bottom line: This is a great ""lots of power for the money"" laptop that has been super reliable for me, and I would recommend it to anyone with similar needs to me, but not if all you need a super lightweight long battery life unit for just email and facebook.",0

"(Buen material y tama?o perfecto): Le quedó perfecto a mi laptop HP 15-ef2126. Lo único que no me gustó es que no es 100% transparente. Las dos piezas de la funda quedaron perfectamente en la laptop y la parte de abajo tiene orificios para que el ventilador enfriar el equipo, además de dos patitas para levantarla un poco. Fue una muy buena compra.",0
"(Surprisingly good value for ther price): This computer is a good buy and works very well. My only complaint is that I have been a pc user all of my life (more than 60 years) and I am having some challenges with the OS. Not their fault. Delivery, packaging, speed, and everything seems really good. I am satisfied.",0
"(great laptop): So far a great system, high specs and little to no bloatware. came with two extra screws in a baggie I assume are for extra SSDs to be mounted but there is no reason given for them I can find. comes with a cd rom with drivers but the PC has no built in cd rom drive, why not include on a thumb drive instead?lightweight, runs cool, great clear display.",0
"(Very Short Lifespan!): Stopped Working after only, a couple months...I gave them Three Stars Only because they said they would Refund us back in Full.",0
(Graphic quality): Only thing is the screen isn’t the best quality but it’s a cheap laptop that works good,0
The port on the left is really fast,0
"(randomly shuts off mid-game, mouse already broke): i’ve had this computer for not even a full year and it’s started to randomly turn off while i’m in the middle of a game. the screen goes back, and i can’t do anything, but the screen is still on because it’s not fully off, there’s light behind it. honestly, for the price, it’s not worth it, just go buy a razer.not only that, but a few months ago the mouse broke for no reason. i don’t violently click and i honestly use the tap-click feature more than i actually press the button, but now i can’t use the trackpad mouse unless i do the tap.",0
"(Great Value): This is an amazing little device. I have not had a PC in my home pretty much since smartphones were invented. I thought I could get by with just the phone and I did, but man this is much easier:) I occasionally need to deal with work stuff after-hours and usually I'm responding to emails or calling someone at the office and telling them what to do. This is perfect for quickly logging in to Citix workspace, fixing whatever needs to be fixed and going back to whatever I was doing. It's faster than the phone and working from home is no big deal now.It seems durable, there isn't much that could break. The screen is a normal laptop screen, it probably cant take a direct hit. The rest of the unit is so light it doesn't seem like it would get damaged if you dropped it. I was a little surprised and disappointed that the charging port is one of those little round plugs. I've always had bad luck with those. I think the last 3 laptops I have owned died because that port went bad and I couldn't charge them. This one seems snug and solid, I guess we'll see.Other than the Citrix work space I have been using browser based stuff and it works great. Noticeably snappy-fast. I fully charged it right out of the box 3 days ago and it's still at 38%. I guess i have used it about 8 hours so the 11 hours battery life claim should be right on.",0
"(does not have PCIe M.2 as advertised): Is this a nice fast computer yes! and great build quality. I love it, however it does NOT contain an M.2 PCIe SSD. it has a SATA SSD, and thus is slower. What boggles my mind is that lenovo reps answer question about the SSD incorrectly as well, stating its a M.2 PCIe. So, great computer, but not what I was sold.",0
"(Fast and sleek looking. Screen is not as bright as the old HP that it's replacing.): This laptop is very sleek and elegant looking, as opposed to a lot of other gaming laptops which are too flashy to be used for work. I appreciate that a lot.The power adapter on this thing is a HUGE 200-watt brick of a thing. It is NOT type C, but personally I don't really care that much.The battery charges quickly and maintains a charge for days. Very happy with that.It boots up in no time. Super fast response time when playing GOW on it. No lag whatsoever at any point.Really the only thing that I wasn't totally impressed with is the display. Next to my old HP computer, it's dimmer. I was surprised that it's only 250 NITS. I have a couple fairly inexpensive portable monitors and even they are 300 and 350 NITS. I'm one of those people that keeps my phone and computers at full brightness all the time. I really like a super bright display, so this was pretty disappointing to me. It makes the graphics look a but dull and not as crisp and vivid as they could be.Aside from that, this thing has checked off every box. It's replacing another HP laptop that is nearly 10 years old. I've had good luck with HP, so decided to stick with it.",0
"(Great performance and design): Lenovo X1 Carbon 6th Gen looks amazing. At a first glance, the sleek black lid with X1 and ThinkPad logos make quite an impression. Once you connect the power charger, a small dot in the ThinkPad logo lights off. A nice touch. And a godd thing is that fingermarks don't stick that much on the matte finish of the lid.The keyboard is the most impressive feature in this machine. I previously had an Yoga 3 Pro, with a decent keyboard. But this one is amazing. Response, height, size, it all make for the best keyboard I've ever seen in a laptop.My machine (Intel Core i7 8thGen vPro, 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 10 Pro, 20KH002JUS model) starts in seconds. Faster than my old Samsung Tablet. It is so fast to start and shut off that I no longer just close the lid. I put it on Hibernate mode.Login became much faster due to the fingerprint reader as well. Just a touch in the reader and I'm logged in. One thing that my Yoga 3 Pro had, and it really bugged me, was a delay on connecting the wireless adapter. Every time I'd start the laptop - or wake it up from Hibernate - I had to wait a while for it to get the wireless on. With the X1 Carbon, it's instantaneous.Screen resolution on my old Yoga was higher than on the X1 Carbon, but that was a choice I made. The screen on the Yoga was brighter and looked better as well. You can get higher res models (mine is 1920 x 1080), but I chose the Full HD version in order to be able to connect an outside monitor without the need to adjust the resolution on the laptop screen - which also bugged me on the Yoga 3 Pro.I read some people complaining about fan noise before I settled for the X1 Carbon. When in full speed, it is noisy, but there is so much power available on the machine that it rarely goes full speed. Even running PowerBI graphs and dashboards, it rarely reaches a point when I hear the fan. When I was configuring the system, installing my stuff and things like that, I heard it. It is a bit noisy, but you will only hear it once in a while, when the processor is being highly demanded.The charger is not too big, and for those who need carry the laptop around - my case - it is not a nuisance. The whole thing - computer and charger - are light enough to travel well. And, for the daily activities you can even chose to leave the charger at home. Unless you plug a lot of stuff on the computer, the battery will last a full work day. I've been using mine for more than five hours, on and off, today and still has 46% of juice left. Not bad at all. Yoga would be at 20~25%.Touchpad is good enough and if you want, there is always the red thingy (not sure what to call it) in the middle of the keyboard. Never got used to it, even in the old days, when IBM ThinkPads had only that to move the pointer. There are three buttons, for those who like to click things, rather than just do multi finger moves on the touchpad.Over all, despite being an expensive machine, X1 Carbon is a great computer. Hope it lasts even more than my Yoga (four years and still working well, just a bit outdated). I recommend for users who need processing power and a light computer to carry around.",0
(Great Deal): Very happy with purchased,0
"(I'm in love. Great looking and super snappy): Well, it really is premature to write a review about a laptop on the day it was received but I was loving how it felt in my hands that I just had to say a few things about it.It is by far the best, fastest laptop or pc I have ever owned. I was so impressed with how fast programs seemed to download and install. It was pretty amazing to me. Even in comparison to a relatively new and powerful laptop owned by my wife, this was far quicker and snappier.I was disappointed in finding out that it uses a proprietary charger. I was really hoping it would be a usb c charger. Can't win them all.I had to settle for a non touch laptop. In order to get the other components, the graphics card and the processor etc, I wasn't able to find a combo with a touchscreen so I had to settle for this. But this is not a negative on this laptop.Even coming out of the box you could tell it was premium. The packaging was really good and protective. It even came inside a soft cloth bag. First time I've had a laptop come that way.The screen is sharp and very clear. Obviously, I still need to test it and put it through it's paces to see how beautiful things will look but the few video clips i put up sounded and looked great.Update: I reduced the rating by 1 star all related to 1 thing. Battery life. I lowered the refresh rate on the screen to 60hz with intent to increase it if and when I game. With settings like this, the laptop seems like it would run for around 5 hours but that's an estimate. And that is not bad. Throw in something that uses the gpu and you get very little. In fact, I was running a golf simulator program called e6 and casting the screen to a 2nd laptop screen. In that mode, this laptop died in about an hour. I shouldn't be surprised though as nobody would game on battery power... Not for a serious gaming session. I still thought I'd get more than 1 hour.Other than that, the laptop performance is spot on and pretty amazing. Crisp and snappy... Fast. Coming from a 6 yr old unit... This thing feels amazing in comparison. Startup is done in a matter of seconds and away you go...",0
The keys are responsive and have a nice back-lighting that isn't overpowered and isn't harsh on the eyes.,0
(Sleek design): This thin laptop is attractive and works efficiently. Great graphics.,0
"(Did not come with Windows 11 and Bluetooth did not function): UPDATE: I was able to install Windows 11 from the Microsoft store, so it is available for this model although it did not come installed. Bluetooth still didn't work, but I bought the $19 ASUS USB Bluetooth dongle and it works great.INITIAL REVIEW: This was described as having bluetooth and Windows 11. There is a bluetooth function on the computer but it won't connect to any of my devices, and the computer has Windows 10, not Windows 11. I am giving three stars because it was affordable and seems to be working in spite of the false advertising and lack of connectivity. I bought a bluetooth dongle, hopefully that will help. If I had spent $500+ I would have been p*ssed.",0
(Five Stars): I'm happy with it,0
(Great buy!): Great computer easy to use. glad I went with this brand!,0
"(Stopped working less than a year of use): A few months after receiving, the unit would start to shutdown on its own, then it would not turn on. It would turn on sometimes, then turn off on its own. This would happen when it was running on the battery or connected to the outlet. Two months shy of a year, it stopped turning on and just completely died. I mildly used the laptop throughout the time I had it, never used it on a daily basis and didn't use it for gaming or high demand applications. Very disappointed as it was almost $500. Never buying an HP laptop again.",0
(Great gift.): Perfect for my kid.,0
(Ger what you don't pay for): I wish I'd know how less than crystal clear the screen was before buying. I've accepted it now but it's definitely subpar especially for the price.,0
"(Love it. Hard to get used to the smaller ...): Love it. Hard to get used to the smaller size, but it is perfect for school since I have to carry it around with me.",0
"(THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK): Sleek design, I wanted a gaming laptop that wasn't big and bulky... THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK... Plus it is 200$ off right now... Screen is nice sized, necromancer is excellent!!! CAN I SAY MORE?!? Has the college design with the guts for GLORY....",0
(Very good laptop and good looking): It’s a great laptop which is fast and beautiful you should definitely buy it,0
"(Es bueno para juegos pero debes tener en cuenta esto:): Me llego a tiempo y en exelente condiciones! Lo recomiendo muchísimo.Tener en cuenta que se calienta bastante y el ventilador hace ruido. Si lo mantienes elevado con algo en las esquinas, así los ventiladores agarran mas aire de abajo y se enfría.Pero los juegos me corren super bien! No me quejo de nada; lo uso también para la universidad y no se traba en nada.Te recomiendo comprarte mas almacenamiento si lo utilizas para jugar muchos juegos.Por lo general, es buen producto.",0
"(“Does not compute”): Hard drive is way to small to be of use. I barely have any software installed and hardly any data stored, and still the antivirus and operating systems fail to download or to install, time and again, because there is not enough disk space for the periodic, automatic updates. In fact, the product description says it is a 128 GB hard drive. but there is actually 244 MB free of 117 GB. That 11 GB below the advertised 128 isn't much, but it would, at least be enough that the product could still function.",0
(First computer for my six grader): It work great for him all year long.,0
"(Chromebook is very well protected from viruses.): This one is for my wife. I loved mine, so I got her the same one. I like the size and features.",0
"(Ryzen 2500u, 8gb ddr4 and 1tb 5400rpm HDD): Got this laptop today and very impressed with it. The laptop is all black and is very light. Its thin but not too thin. The screen is good and it doesn't reflect too much glare. The keyboard keys are responsive and have a nice click response to them. The track pad is responsive and the mouse buttons are also well made, they click and respond very good even if you click on the far left side of the mouse buttons. The laptop boots up fairly quickly even with the 5400rpm mechanical hard drive. I ordered a 500gb Samsung 860 evo SSD and plan to install it into the laptop to really bring out the power of the Ryzen 5 prosessor. I opened 8 tabs of mozilla firefox, downloading and installing mutiple software simultaneously, Windows 10 updates, and ran cinebench at the same time, I did not feel or notice any slow downs on the laptop. It ran up to 70c when I was doing all of that with cinebench making the processor at 100% at 3.6ghz. I think if you want a really good workhorse for cheap and don't mind spending extra money on an SSD, this laptop has really good value for the money. I got this laptop for 400 and with the 4 cores and 8 threads that its equipped with you can't beat it. I definitely recommend this laptop especially in the 400-500 range. I will update the review while I use the laptop more.",0
(Five Stars): One of my favorite things I own,0
(Works and looks perfect.Light weight!): Asus is the best!,0
(Poor battery life.): Noticable Screen back light .Battery life is very poor 1 hour for light use 35 min for gaming if you use without plug in. Other than that it's a perfect machine for the price.,0
"(Terribly Slow): This thing is terribly slow and lags almost to the point of being inoperable for any kind of multi-tasking. Many people told me Chromebooks work fine for them and get the job done, but when I try to do anything that uses any kind of RAM, it just starts lagging and everything moves at a snail's pace. I will actually find myself waiting for the directory in my Google Drive to load, then when I double click on a file I have to wait, then I have to wait for the file to load up, and that's for a Google Doc. If I try to open a Google Slide it lags and is unresponsive.Honestly, I got what I paid for. It's a cheap machine and technically operative, but if I had a time machine I would not buy it and would shell out some more money for a more decent machine.",0
(Three Stars): The chromebook did meet my expectations.,0
(Great price): Super fast. Great graphics. Fans a little loud. Case is a fingerprint magnet. Overall an awesome laptop!,0
"(Solid Gaming Laptop): I purchased this laptop to be used with iRacing (which is more simulation than game) and it has not disappointed! The graphics are excellent and the cooling fan noise (which others had complained about) has not been an issue. The system has nice cooling metrics and significant control over such things, but even at AUTO setting, I have been very pleased. I have not spent much time with it off AC power, so I cannot speak for the battery life, but it is not rated at a long time at all for modern laptops. Overall, I am very pleased!",0
(Right amount of features - no baggage of unwanted programs.): Great little computer for my 95 year old aunt.,0
"(Really enjoying it!): Easily runs any game I have throw at it so far. The only problem I have is that the battery port is on left side of the computer. Which keeps being slightly inconvenient, though I may just be used to a laptop with the port on the right side.",0
"It has a large trackpad, which is godsend for someone who usually uses Macs.",0
(Grainy Camera): I wanted to love this and it runs smoothly but the camera is very grainy and low quality. I was going to send it back but the seller will add a 20% restocking fee which would be around 60.00 ..so if the camera is important to you Id skip this laptop and get another,0

"(SO done with the quirks): I actually initially liked this, especially compared to my former Macbook that was so slow and would refuse to turn on. However, every time I leave a tab and then come back to it, it completely reloads. That means lost posts, lost emails, and a LONG time spent waiting for everything to reload. If you only ever plan to have one tab open at once, this is a great device. Otherwise, look for something else.",0

"(This was a very good computer, but it had a hardware failure in the first month): I liked everything about it except it broke which can happen to any computer. It worked great until it didn't, so I had to return it.",0
"(Audio breaks pretty regularly; have to restart constantly.): We purchased these for remote school. They pretty regularly fail to recognize headphones or have their internal mics fail. Rebooting usually fixes this, but with a managed Chromebook, the login process is really arduous.Don't recommend.",0
(Highly Recommend): I have had my laptop for 6 months and am still happy with my purchase.,0
"(love it but unstable): I wanted to keep this laptop. I bought the 6900HX version. After initial Win 11 setup, it hung on me 4 times the first night. Then I was going to boot into a Linux live ISO to see if it was a Windows 11 problem but after booting into the BIOS to disable secure boot, the laptop hung in the BIOS as well. All hangs required a hard power off.I'd of kept the laptop except for the above. The screen is excellent.",0
(Great Price): i really love everything about this.,0
(lightweight and fast!): This is a fantastic computer for school. It is really lightweight and fast. I really enjoy how big and bright the screen is and the full HD display. Its plenty fast to use it for the internet and its a guy price!,0
"(Beautiful Gaming Laptop): I love the way it looks, the colors, the sleekness. I love the way it feels with the steel screen casing. I appreciate the ventilation. Has enough ports for USB and HDMI. Though I understand the special cooling system is so important and a great feature, I don't enjoy how loud it is and it seems to come on when I do not expect it would. I'm sure that can be adjusted, I'm still learning. I'm not too keen on the big clicking the mouse pad does. But I'll probably get an external mouse eventually. This is my first gaming laptop and I have zero regrets! I love playing with the different keyboard light options. The screen with all of my games, such as Smite, Fortnite, Call Of Duty, and more look fantastic! Thank you MSI and Steel Series!",0
(Lenovo Chromebook): Does not have touch screen.,0
(Great computer works with oculus quest): I bought to use with oculus quest works great both usb-c and USB-a ports work for it,0

"(One giant leap for Laptop Gaming): My last gaming laptop purchase was an old bulky Asus gaming laptop from 2010. It was also a 17"" laptop and proved troublesome to find a backpack it would fit in! This laptop however, is much thinner than that old dinosaur and WAY more powerful. My only regret was, I got the RTX 2060 version a little over a month before Prime Day. The RTX 2070 version was priced at what I paid for the RTX 2060 on Prime Day, doh! Other than that, this laptop does everything I need it for work trips, plus entertainment. I can easily logged onto my AWS workspace for business purposes and game on my off time while traveling. Also, it fits in my work backpack that was purchased for my 14"" work laptop!I bought an IPS panel monitor for Desktop at home. I can never go back to a TN panel ever again. That was very appealing for this laptop, the IPS panel looks great on it! I've gotten around 80 - 100 fps for PUBG, CIV 5 144fps, I might even play WoW Classic on it as well. Which, I am sure it will get over 100 fps.",0
"(Great all-around laptop): It's fast, great for all around use like gaming and school work. The speakers sound nice for Netflix for example. Solid state drive is the way to go. Turns on in seconds.",0
"(Suuuuper slow hard drive.): Great vendor, terrible laptop. What good is all that CPU and RAM if the hard drive is so slow? It was intolerable - i returned it. I think this would be a great laptop if you wanted to sink another couple hundred for a SSD and void the warranty but I didn’t. Found one with same specs and SSD online elsewhere for just a little more.",0
(Good value): Great for my 11 year old,0
(Bad screen): Can not be ignored very annoying,0
(It is very good laptop. Is fast.): This Core I3 laptop works perfectly for navigating in internet and using office 365.,0
"(Good for work): When I first received the laptop, I was not able to turn it on and had to plug it into an outlet. Something interesting I noticed is that the laptop feels slightly heavier after I charged it comparing to how I felt when I first took it out of the box.The laptop is lightweight, and the metallic look doesn't make it look cheap. When you open the lid, it will push the laptop slightly off from the surface below. Since the speaker is down-facing, you might hear echoes depending on the material of the surface below it. I felt a bit weird about the audio at first but get used to it after a short period of time. Also, the laptop sometimes can make high-pitched noises. Since it doesn't happen very often and is barely noticeable, it's not a big deal for me. The battery performance is not very impressive. Light gaming (playing Fall Guys) for an hour drained 35% of the battery. One more thing I noticed is that if I have a YouTube page opened before I put the laptop to sleep, the next time I turn it on, the video will get stuck with a white screen. Waiting a bit or refreshing the page will help, but that's kind of annoying. Overall, it's still a good laptop for normal office work.",0
"(Very happy): I love this laptop. It replaced an Acer aspire 5 slim, which was quite heavy, and had a battery that lasted five hours. In power saver mode. It was only two years old and rarely used until I started a new job and school. I had my MacBook going from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. Because I have an iPhone, I can make calls and send texts with it. My iPad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. The mac doesn’t skip a beat- I can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. It’s not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. The Mac OS not supporting steam titles thing isn’t a huge deal- If I want a gaming machine, I have a desktop. For getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone. My one gripe is lack of USB-A ports, but I’ll buy an adapter and move on with my life. Overall, try a MacBook Air… You’ll like it. UPDATE: I found a program called Parsec and so long as my Mac has a stable WiFi connection, I can remote into my desktop and use steam along with everything else.",0
"(Entrega muy rápida y en perfecto estado por estafeta): He estado probando esta PC por 2 meses y hasta ahora todo muy bien en cuanto a rendimiento y rapidez, la uso para office, internet y demás.El único detalle que le veo es el ángulo de visión ya que si la cierras o abres un poco cambia mucho los colores a más claro u obscuro todo depende del ángulo y eso suele ser incómodo, la pantalla dejo mucho que desear por ese detalle, pero por el precio podría entenderlo.",0
"(Strix Scar II 2070, GL704GW-DS76 - clunky software and backlight bleed mar an otherwise nice machine): I just received my Strix Scar II with an RTX 2070... fortunately, I've not seen any of the BSOD horror stories I see in the low star reviews here. I'll update after more time has passed.Overall the machine is pretty nice, and gaming is nearly as fast as on my desktop, but the pretty severe back-light bleed, and the clunky ASUS software (especially the keyboard RGB) leave me a bit underwhelmed by this laptop at the $2200 I paid for it in Feb 2019. That said, it is one of the less expensive options with this hardware config, and perhaps these compromises are what let them hit that price point.Pros:- great gaming frame-rate, decent screen, very responsive.... this thing feels nearly as fast as my 1080 Ti desktop.- reasonably slim and durable form factor- lots of USB-A ports (which I need)- BIOS has a setting to disable the annoying ROG brand POST graphic sound.- the membrane keyboard feels decent and is VERY quiet.Cons:- there is pretty massive screen backlight bleed in the corners (FHD 144hz 3ms screen)... it doesn't really affect functionality, but in a $2200 laptop i expect better- The power button LED is blaring super bright red... I'm going to need to black-marker it or something- fans run loudly at odd times when the laptop is not doing anything intensive .... they calm down, but I don't care for the way the laptop feels like it's a jet taking off just because I powered it on- software-preload came in an abysmal state. drivers were old, on a laptop that was *just* released in the last few weeks. audio was popping. unclear how to update ASUS software. I finally removed some of it, updated some of it, and got it sorted. Audio seems fine now.- setting up keyboard RGB was confusing. I couldn't find the right tool, so I installed ""ROG AURA"" from their website, but this was the wrong tool, laptops need ""ROG AURA Core""... after installing this I was able to separately configure the 4-keyboard-regions, light-bar, and back-of-screen logo like I wanted.- the keyboard layout is a bit weird, especially the arrow keys..- the camera is not only in the lower right of the screen, but it's not angled up, so to actually get my face in frame, I have to tilt the screen uncomfortably far back... i suppose it's better than no webcam, but it's not reasonable for regular use. Fortunately i don't use that much on a laptop.- there is no hardware keyboard remapping tool... something that's pretty important for gaming. I used SharpKeys to do windows registry remapping (capslock->control), but this doesn't work properly with League of Legends for some reason... on my desktop I use a gaming keyboard with a remapping driver and it works great.",0
"(Don't Buy): I've had this for about a week now and it's definitely a disappointment. Prior to this I had HP stream but that started to slow up on me so after looking over a few options I decided on the Vivobook. I've always used Chromebooks and the main purpose has always been for school so with the specs thought I'd give this a shot.This was my 1st Asus device and it worked for the 1st day after that the trackpad started to get glitchy. Following that web pages didn't load and the script for the pages crashed, although the load speed was quite fast. Also why have a tablet mode when it's not touch?I was finally able to download Chrome thinking that might make a difference but nothing changed will be returning this.",0
(Great system for the price): I figured that I would write about why I chose this specific model. Everything is the same except for the ram and hard drive sizes. I added my own HDD and ram for under 140 dollars. To have bought this with the upgrades would have cost me 350 to 400 dollars more and that's not using the Samsung HDD and ripjaw memory I put in. For what it is it's great. Plays all of my wife's favorite games and runs her software she wants. Great for a medium gaming machine.,0
(good so far): Liking it so far. Quiet and fast. Decent battery life. Light weight is nice,0
(Not good....): This laptop is rough.... I have an older version that is SO much faster than this laptop. To load a video takes over a minute. It freezes up all the time. Not impressed and I love HP products.,0
"(over heats way too much): it has overheating/thermal throttling problems and you dont feel like you get your full value off of the 1050ti plus you can build a better pc overall with that kind of money, dont recommend you buy this crap",0
I really liked this product for its speed and resolution.,0
(One Laptop stopped working Advise soonest on next move!): I love this product I purchased three/with warranty,0
"(Awesome and Upgradable.): Awesome computer... Already upgraded, installing two m.2 SSD's and a 2.5 SSD giving me 6Tb of onboard storage.Only thing it didn't have was a SD card reader",0
(DONT BUY): Computers touch screen stopped working after a week every time you close this laptop it has a chance to crack the screen shuts to hardJust not a good laptop for the price,0
"(Great for a budget laptop): It’s a great machine, I uses everyday for school related stuffs.",0
(Not new): Mine appears to have been used or refurbished. Has signs of use,0
"(great computer, even greater value): i absolutely love this pc, for its price its the best investment ive had done, i recommend this one 100%, i always preferred lenovo and this time they really proved to be the best",0
"(Muy lenta): REalmente la computadora no la recomiendo. Ademas de los problemas consecuentes de la poca ram, lo cual es lógico pero se puede resolver poniendole otra RAM. El disco duro tiene problemas de fabrica , se calienta solo aun con un ambiente frio, lento, uff terrible, y el windows 11 que trae el peor sistema operativo de todos. DE las peores compras.",0
Keys feel great for typing and gaming,0
It has the best processor you can practically get in a laptop right now and has plenty of ram to go with it!,0
I am having a lot of fun designing keyboard light layouts,0
"(I wish I had bought something something a little better.): I use this Chromebook for basic internet surfing. Sadly it is the slowest new computer I've ever bought, which is super frustrating because I bought it to replace a slow Windows PC. I wish I had returned it within the window to do so. On the positive side, it looks good, has a nice big screen, and starts up quickly.",0
"(Good product): It is a good product. Keyboard smaller than I was used to, learning to work with it.",0
"(Satisfecho con la compra): Es muy rápida y puedo cumplir con mis tareas sin problema, casi no juego en PC pero probé algunos con mi Xbox Game pass y jugué sin problema de manera fluida.",0
"(Decent gaming laptop with ok performance.): Powerful gami laptop, expect to run almost everything at medium and up settings. But expect it heating on the right side of keyboard, cooling system is decent. Temperature never goes up more than 75°C.",0
(Overheating just past return deadline): We used this as a work computer for an associate located remotely. She started having issues with it overheating on her desk. Unfortunately this happened just past the return deadline in September. It lasted about 5 weeks.,0
"(Mixed Feelings But Overall Satisfied): I definitely have mixed feelings about this computer. There are both positives and negatives that I have discovered in my 2 years of use (purchased March 2020).Positives:On the one hand, it is very powerful. I use it for 3D modeling and rendering and it works so well. Things I did on my last laptop that would crash don't crash on this laptop and successfully complete. I like the keyboard, it's kind of big so it took a bit to get used to but now I actually prefer this size. The screen resolution is great and I like how big the screen is.Negatives:On the other hand, the battery life sucks. I'm lucky if the battery lasts 2 hours off charger and when I'm running 3D modeling programs it's even less. It's also way too heavy, I'm a student and have to carry it around all the time and it hurts my back. And the camera... The camera is terrible! The resolution is ok, but it doesn't consistently work! Fall 2020, so like 6-8 months after I got it the camera just kept repeatedly shutting down randomly and eventually stopped working entirely (which was terrible because I was working from home and needed the camera). It was still under warranty so I sent it in and they replaced it. From then it was working fine until like 2 weeks ago (April 2022). In the last couple weeks it has randomly been shutting off during use and not be able to restart until I restart the computer. I'm worried it's going to break completely again.",0
"(DO NOT BUY): Honestly I wish I didn't buy this laptop. The speakers are weak and the screen does not look good. This laptop also has a grounding issues, so out of nowhere the mouse pad stops working until I pickup the laptop and stand barefoot on the ground. Go to Best Buy and explore some options, because this laptop (and likely a lot of other Asus laptops), are not priced at a fair market value for what you get. Weak computing power (to be fair I didn't buy this laptop looking for computing power), weak speakers, a weak screen, a faulty Wifi card that randomly drops signal until I restart my computer. These issues are worth avoiding by spending time finding better alternatives.",0
"(Great when it's on sale): I really enjoyed my purchase of this laptop, everything works well but the battery life isn't very good unless you use it for the bare minimum on the lowest power settings available. For 999 plus tax it was an excellent purchase but now that the price went up I'd probably look for other options on that price range. Very satisfied nonetheless",0
The touchpad works very well which surprised me.,0
"(Do Not Buy): Charger died 1 day after return/exchange window; cameras are garbage. Even 128 GB version from Best Buy has these problems. Short of warranty, hinge broke and screen shattered just opening it. Samsung would not honor warranty. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Do not by this trash.",0
(p/p): - 60w battery.- no mouse in box.- backlight blending (right bottom)+ no dead pixelsp/p,0
"(This product is the worst purchase yet and I'm strongly disappointed!): I would advise u not to buy this laptop! I purchased mine in May, 31st, 2019 and I can count on one hand how many times I've used it and it just shut off on December 10th, 2019. Called about it and they say they can't refund me but offered to fix. This doesn't make sense!🤬🤬🤬 How can one be selling a product that stops working in couple months! Your money just goes down the drain like that and I've also been told that these brands aren't even good. So what the hell should I do now! I need back my money so I can purchase a better product! Kmt",0
(Excelente producto): Me gusto el tamaño es preciso lo que necesitaba y la velocidad con la que maneja todo es perfecta.,0
"(Great for simple computing): I'm not a computer geek, so I can't give you any kind of computer lingo for this device. My MIL, almost 80 years old, likes to do some internet surfing, going through her e-mail, and playing solitaire. For her this is a great option. It doesn't have Windows so it is more secure as well. It was strange for me when I was setting it up for her. I had a hard time finding things (I'm used to a computer with Windows on it). But once I tootled around with it I was able to find my way around and knew this would work for her. My husband and I ended up buying an Acer tower and I love it. It does have Windows on it (I do a lot of word processing), and the browser is super fast compared to what we had.",0
(It works well): Does the job. No complaints.,0
(Redemption): Black screen on unboxing moments ago.I am speechless and mortified of the amount of money I paid to get a dead screen on arrival. I can’t even get into windows! I can’t do anything!!!Update: Amazon sent a new pc promptly and everything has been resolved. The gaming pc is very fast and what I had hoped for!!!,0
"(Just a cheap flimsy tablet with a shoddy keyboard): small, light and flimsy which i expected. the keys are sticking after light use after a year and the touch screen is non existent. does not easily transform into a tablet. also, google chromebook is terrible because most apps are only made for android /windows or apple and google is its own thing so its hard to get non-bootleg or knock off apps for some things. i would have been better off spending and extra 50-100 to get a refurbished actual laptop. also, keyboard doesnt have a caps lock button and i think ive shown that on my review since i am struggling to type on this as we speak.",0
"(You can get a better quality laptop for much cheaper): Some people have noted in their reviews that the quality of the {…} feature is good “considering the price” … No. Even though this laptop is under $500, some features should not be as bad as they are.The screen on this laptop is decent, but it could be better, brighter, and less dull. I initially did not care much about the design of the laptop, but if you need something sleek and sexy, then this model is not the best.My biggest pain point with this laptop is the webcam. There is no reason that the webcam shouldn’t even be 2001 quality. The video has terrible playback, lag, and you will appear extremely fuzzy and grainy. For nearly $500 this webcam should be better. There’s no reason for the horrible level of quality considering ASUS is a company claiming to be making breathtaking products… hah.When I went to Walmart to look at comparably priced and even cheaper laptops, like the chrome book, their webcams were much more crisp and clear.If you need a laptop for web calls, this is not the laptop for you. I purchased this laptop for a family member who does not do much on the computer besides personal work…but the quality is still terrible. No one should have to settle for a computer that is only good if you “just want to browse the internet and watch YouTube videos…” It’s 2021 and the bar should be set higher.",0
(Pretty decent): Good value for the price but the graphics are not the greatest and some apps can be glitchy. The battery life is great and it’s easy to use. The touchscreen works fine.,0
(Defective Product): The keyboard did not work. Product was returned.,0
"(Great gaming laptop): I've had this for a couple months now and love it! Picture is amazing, I can run most games at lightning fast fps on high or max settings. League of Legends, Tabletop Simulator, Subnautica, Civilization, all look amazing.Only gripe is that the USB-C port does not support monitors.",0
"(Fair for the price): It's not bad for the price range, I'm a bit on the fence whether or not I want to keep it or not. What I don't like so far: USB-C doesn't support Thunderbolt, one of the USB -A ports is 2.0, which is literally stupid, and the RTX 3070 is a truly low performance 3070. Not only is it the lower power version which equates to lower performance, not listed in the description is that it is a Max-Q version, which means even lower performance. Max-Q is supposed to be quieter and cooler, however from the sounds of the fans when this thing is used for gaming, it's loud, so you get a loud, underperforming 3070 compared to other mobile 3070 GPUs. As I write this, I'm leaning towards returning, and spend a couple hundred dollars more so I get everything I want, instead of settling because it's ""OK for the price"".",0
"(Backlit Key Does Not Work): I purchased this item and the backlit key didn’t work. Called HP for troubleshooting and it still didn’t work. I am a tech expert so I was aware of troubleshooting steps they walked me thru but is still didn’t work. I received a replacement from Amazon and the backlit key still does not work. My friend and I googled it and those options for the function still didn't work. Viewed the exact model on google and followed steps and still didn't work. I googled q&a and it said it had the backlit keys but that is incorrect. After troubleshooting myself, following instructions from the instructions within the package, verifying the correct model with the instructions, speaking to HP tech that said he had the same model just a few years older...all this and I then google some tech q&a on this product and it Does Not have the feature. I needed this PC for work and now I am beating against time to have one shipped to me. Only after I received a replacement did I discover the misinformation about the features for this PC. 😡",0
(Good laptop and amazing delivery): Got this as a gift during prime day sale. It came very promptly. I also live in an apartment complex and have a special kiosk system for packages. It's nice when I am out of town which I was when the package came. It came earlier than expected. I don't usually use the kiosk but they left it in there for me all securely. Laptop works great. The gift was a success as well! The only thing is that the camera could be better. My boyfriend needed a laptop due to his Lenovo shutting down and a nice camera (his old one stopped working) to confirm his identity for online tests. He tested it out and it was pretty blurry for a pricey laptop which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.,0
"(Great entry lv gaming laptop. Runs hot though.): The Nitro 5 feels like a quality laptop. It feels perfect for a slightly above entry level gaming laptop. The only complaint and why I didn't give it 5 stars, is it runs pretty hot. I recently replaced the stock thermal paste with high quality paste meant to handle even extreme setups. It brought the cpu temp down about 8°. Diablo 3, The Witcher 3, FFXIV, etc.. All runs at a decent temp on higher settings. FFXV turns my Nitro into a supernova at medium settings even with the new thermal paste (will frequently spike to 93°-96°). Other than that it'll play any new game on the market at medium graphics with a decent fps and it'll play most games at medium to max settings at a good fps. I'd recommend replacing the stock thermal paste asap.All in all, for the price I would highly recommend this laptop. Just don't expect to be playing something like Cyberpunk higher than medium with anything higher than 30-40 fps.",0
"(Not for all around use): GOOD: This laptop is a beast! A great entry level gaming laptop. It's a thrill to have the AMD Ryzen 7 processor, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB solid state HD. Laptop construction feels solid, and so far no mechanical or software issues. Windows 10 Home setup default, with very minimal bloatware included. Very fast boot time. In general this equipment takes very little time to get used to.MEH: While the Lenovo Legion 5 may be a great entry level gaming machine, I would NOT recommend this laptop for daily use.For one thing, this device costs about $200 more than equivalent non-gaming laptops, including several models from Lenovo. It seems to be only the processor and video quality that you are paying extra for. If you want a laptop for something other than gaming, there are other options.The power cord is an unusual proprietary 230W brick. And you had better buy a second one, because this laptop is not compatible with any docking station that will power the laptop. Yes, you can hook up a USB-C generic docking station, but you'll still need to also plug into your power cord. And by the way, that extra power cord will set you back at least $76. (This is not an expense you'd have to pay if you purchase a laptop that powers by USB-C. I really wish I had considered this.)MISC: As mentioned, the construction of this laptop is solid, and that includes the keyboard and palm rest. But overall this shell seems particularly attractive to dust and smudges. If you plan to travel with your new Legion 5 laptop, be sure to bring some dust cloths.And you may not want to travel with this beast, as it's quite heavy.OVERALL: I wish I had done more research before buying this laptop. It's solid, and should perform well. But also limited for daily use. I'm particularly disappointed at the expensive proprietary charging cable and the lack of a compatible docking station.",0
"(Perfect for the Money!): The key board uses every color under the rainbow and will alternate between colors. It is fast and it has played anything that I have thrown at it like Red Dead Redemption 2, Red Dead Redemption, STAR WARS Jedi Fallen Order?, Borderlands,2,3, and every game that I have on STEAM plays excellent on this. It does run a little warm. But if you use the cooler boost it cools down but it id load. Right now as typing I'm at 38c 100f. But the fan is silent right now. Let me put on Cooler Boost and see...better 32c 89f. Lets see with a Load.. Cooler boost on... 100f-112f. Frame rates run avg 90-144. These were all set on extreme performance with the MSI Center.",0

"(Beautiful and well made.): Dell XPS 13 9310 Touchscreen Laptop 13.4 inch FHD+ Thin and Light. Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB LPDDR4x RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Windows 11 Pro, 2Yr OnSite, 6 months Dell Migrate – SilverThis Laptop Is stunning. It's sleek and is very well made. Summary is, we are very happy with this laptop despite Dell and their bloatware.The XPX 9310 measures 0.58 by 11.6 by 7.8 inches and weighs just over 2.5 lbs. The display is 1,920/1,200-pixels and looks beautiful. It's not quite as vivid as Retina display but it's really close. The 16 by 10 aspect ratio feel really good on this size laptop. The XPS 13 has only to two USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 support. If you have a lot of stuff, you'll need a dock or hub. Performance is great and we have had zero issue with the CPU or Ram getting bogged down in Photoshop or blender. It's not as desktop so it's not as fast at rendering but does a pretty decent job keeping up with my 4 year old loaded out desktop.My biggest beef is how difficult Dell makes it to remove the bloatware. Some of the software is stubborn, but some is pretty near impossible to get rid of. I tried doing a clean install from a usb drive and Dell blocked it. So, thanks Dell, you get one star off.",0
"(Portability without sacrificing power): I bought this laptop for my upcoming college classes and have been using it instead of my desktop ever since I got it. It's quiet when not gaming, a little louder when gaming, but that's the least of my concerns. It gets the job done and while I tend to have the laptop plugged up when I play anything draining on a battery, I do get a bit anxious that the battery wouldn't last very long at all while playing anything intensive. But... that's what the cable is for. I can't bring myself to give this machine anything less than a five-star rating because it's earned every single star.Second MSI laptop, second time I've been delivered a quality product.",0

"(Sound completely stopped working): When I first received the laptop the metal around one of the USB ports was bent, which was mostly aesthetic so I was able to ignore it. The laptop worked great until recently when the sound completely stopped working. Neither the built in speakers or plug in headphones produce any sound besides a small crackle. The only way I can hear sounds is from Bluetooth headphones. Customer support is a pain to deal with, especially now because phones are down.",0
"(Amazing Laptop): This laptop is amazing! Very portable and powerful. No issues with it at all. I've been using it for Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier Pro and After Effects. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a powerful, thin and lightweight laptop.",0
(Unreliable early days. Returned it.): Some problems with operation. Stopped for no reason and wouldn't restart. After a few hours it did. But unreliability seemed inappropriate for such an expensive computer. Returned it.,0
"(First gaming laptop, but it's performing well!): This is my first gaming laptop and I've only had it for a few days, but it's been very nice so far. I love the way the keyboard feels and it's very lightweight. I haven't done much hardcore gaming on it yet but it runs Star Wars The Old Republic very well. I would recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a reasonably priced gaming laptop.",0
(Had to return): I cancelled the purchase,0
The keyboard is also great for typing,0
"Beautiful screen and keyboard, thin and light.",0
"(Grab this deal now!): This is a great deal for a high quality computer! It just arrived today and setup was incredibly easy and I was able to start gaming right away. I was a long time MacBook user and initially worried about the transition to PC but this computer is very user friendly and provides a perfect balance between your typical laptop needs (email, work, etc) and gaming. If you are an Apple user thinking about converting - do it now! This price point is excellent for the quality computer you are getting.",0
This portable pc is pretty good,0
(Doesn't work): Sending it back. It doesn't work.,0
"(Battery doesn’t last): Not sure why, could be settings, but battery is always running out. I hardly use this computer, it’s like brand new and I leave it on charger. It somehow it isn’t charging all the way to 100%. May be an easy fix? Unsure, but it is annoying me and I’m getting a MacBook.",0
"(Beautiful Laptop, top quality!): Beautiful computer, light weight, sophisticated, very smart, great for school!!!!",0
"(Da problemas): Me gusta su dise?o y características, solo que ya van 2 días diferentes que al encenderla me sale esto , tengo que apagar la y esperar a que se reinicie otra vez.espero y lo deje de hacer",0
"they are lighter, usually faster, and less glitchy/problematic",0
(Gets the job done): Everything I expected,0
"(UPDATE: HP un-reliability strikes me again and Seller is not responding BACK): I am typing this on an older Mac that still works perfectly. June 27th, this ""new"" HP went through an update of software and would never restart. It was operating fine from May 1, 2020 until, June 27th. Contacted the Seller and got a reply back focused on the Hard Drive replacement - but nothing on who to ship to or how to ship back. My second request last week, for resolution has not been responded to by the Seller as of 1:20 PM EST July 6, 2020. Dark screen and turned very warm on the underside. No dust accumulation on the vents but the Fan was not running at all. After the past 16 + years of Laptop use, I was very reluctant to buy an HP. It had been operating OK since it arrived May 1, 2020. On June 27th it appears to have died. The seller is not responding to my second request and HP shows this NEW Notebook as out of Warranty. You cannot trust a seller who advertises ""NEW"" This may be my very last purchase of anything on AMAZON if it is not made right. Amazon did authorize the return and refund but packing material and a larger box to protect during shipping is not provided in Amazon's arrangement with UPS. I am out of pocket $14.90 and all the cost of all the software I downloaded to the Laptop. LAST PURCHASE OF A COMPUTER THROUGh AMAZON. NO MATTER THE SAVINGS, ITS NOT WORTH THE GREIF AND COSTS. HC",0
(Excelente producto): Buen producto de excelente calidad,0
(Very happy): This laptop replaces an older ROG that I was also very happy with. In addition to the performance and spec improvements I love the smaller form factor. Personally I don't find the fan overly noisy even at it's highest setting.,0
"(Lo que esperaba): La laptop va bastante fluida, el encendido y al abrir aplicaciones de ofimática, R Studio, o power bi es instantaneo... He probado un par de juegos, aunque algo antiguos van de maravilla... Mientras no abras juegos la computadora no emite ruido alguno , ni tampoco se calienta.. La batería no es una maravilla pero tampoco es para quejarse... Lo único que no me gusta mucho es el teclado, es demasiado sensible al tacto",0
My laptop would give me a BSOD more often than not.,0
"(Design Flaw): Other than the high temperature this laptop can reach I cannot understand the design of the edges, why are they so sharp or was mine not finished. There are 2 sharp edges at both ends of the base facing the user. That's a dangerous flaw.",0
"(Four Stars): Overall is good, although the touch pad is a bit annoying when using it.",0
(Love my Mac!): I have been a Mac user for a long time and this one is certainly up to standards. Got some great help from Mac setting it up and ended the frustrations of my old one.,0
(Awesome!): So far it’s fantastic! Downloaded several games and not a problem running them! Even on ultra settings!,0
(Nice laptop): Works great!,0
(Major cooling issues with this laptop): Fans wear out too fast have already had to replace them twice if anyone after market fan company is out there please make better fans for this laptop as the bog standard asus ones are terrible otherwise its a good laptop,0
"(Muy rápida): Es una excelente compra, el pedido llegó antes de lo estimado, y cumple con todo lo descrito.",0
"(Poor quality control): I bought this touchscreen XPS13 laptop after the bezel started to peel away on the XPS13 non-touchscreen model just a few weeks after buying it. That should've been a sign that Dell's quality control is down the tubes. Anyway, the touchscreen model has ~6 hour battery life, not the best, and after a year the AC adapter stopped working. Since the whole point of this laptop is to be portable, I shelled out another $200 to get the AC adapter fixed. The fix lasted only a couple months. Somewhere along the way the speakers started buzzing too.At the end of the day, I wish I'd never bought a XPS13 to begin with. You might get lucky and receive one without any problems, or you might not. I'll be looking for a more reliable laptop model in the future.",0
(Hands Down Best Laptop!): Never owned a Mac and now never going back to Windows. So smooth and fast with phenomenal battery life up to 8+ hours. Great screen as well with backlit keyboard. Easy to transfer files from Windows. This is money well spent replacing a 5+ years old slow heavy HP laptop!,0
(Excellent!!): Better than I thought,0
"(Much more capable than I was even hoping for!): When I saw the specs included a 50-tier (3050ti) GPU, I was a little worried that it would not have quite enough power for all my games. Obviously, a dedicated GPU would run some of my older games that I wanted to play, but I was worried about some of the more demanding ones. It turns out my worries were for nothing!This laptop has been great for every game I've thrown at it, from older games to new games that came out this year! Most of the games I've played even run at near-top or top-quality settings! Now, there are a couple of caveats to this claim. First, I'm running these games at 1080p. 4K might be a different story. Also, there are far more demanding titles out there (EX: Cyberpunk) that I have not tried. However, this laptop's 3050ti is far more capable than I originally gave it credit for!Another nice surprise came when I opened up the back panel. The expandability of this laptop is much better than many other modern laptops on the market. It has 2 m.2 NVMe slots and 2 ram slots, which allows you to expand the original capabilities of this laptop!A lot of the Legion laptops have LED lighting around the side and on the lid as well and this one does not. It's nice to still have it on the keyboard, but the options are a lot more limited on this model. Speaking of the keyboard, the typing position, although offset, is pretty comfortable and feels good. It doesn't feel cheap and the travel is decent, with a nice satisfying click.Airflow can be a bit of an issue. When placed on a flat surface, the airflow becomes somewhat restricted and the fans need to ramp up to max to keep up when running games. However, with just a little extra space under the laptop with something like a portable stand (or just one that doesn't have a solid surface supporting the laptop), airflow is significantly increased and the fans usually spin down to a medium speed.While this laptop isn't the most powerful on the market, I really like the balance of performance and energy/battery efficiency and overall I am very happy with this laptop!",0
"(Great value, clean sturdy case, fits most residential applications): These are pretty good little computers, you won’t find anything with that type of hardware for the price, definitely worth the money",0
Thin-and-light laptops are usually too thin for these ports.,0
(Lemon Laptop): Did not power on and did not even charge with power cable right out of the box. A newly bought laptop shouldn’t give this experience.,0
(Just set up.): I just set up this computer to do my graphics design work. It is a beautiful computer and lighter than I thought it would be. The set up was very easy and I look forward to having the power I need to accomplish my graphics projects.,0
(Increíble): Potente laptop a un buen precio,0
(It was a gift to my granddaughter. She says she loves it!!!!): Gift to my granddaughter. She says she loves it. The other questions she would have to answer.,0
changing the lighting of the keyboard are very nice using the steelseries program,0
(Great for gaming and watching YouTube): I purchased it for a young man who broke his last laptop and needed a good replacement. He is very satisfied for what he uses it for and is just head-over-heals pleased with its performance.,0
"(fast, powerful): runs Solidworks and CAD without issue.",0
"The keyboard feels nice, good amount of travel on this thin of a laptop",0
(Computer died after only 9 months of use and HP didn't cover warranty because product was not new): I purchased a New Chromebook in June 2018 and after only 9 months of use (and no damage) it died - will not turn on. Amazon Seller provides no warranty and when I contacted HP with serial number I was told it had actually been purchased in 2017 and the warranty period had expired. Buyers Beware - If I had known this I would have never purchased from Amazon but would have purchased from a retailer.,0
"(Excellent for Work and Study): --almost 3 weeks usage--Great for Work / Mail / Internet ""stuff"" / Study tasks.Fast boot, bright image.Strong build. I didn't like the Camera.The sound is excellent, very good speakers (but nobody uses them..)Keyboard is ok, Track pad ok too.I've not tried playing games.. I have no opinion about it..It has 4 cores and 8 threads.. really wasn't expecting that..I should have read the specifications first..I use Hangout and Skype a lot, If camera was better I'd give five stars",0
(Keeps turning off): Purchased this for my wife to use. It constantly turns off. Sometimes when it is on the screen is unreadable as it is pixilated and you can't see any content. You must turn off and restart.,0
(Great price.): I don’t really use this laptop for gaming but I am impresses with it’s audio and video quality. I use this mostly for music study and research. Can’t beat it for the price.,0
"(Love this! Great price for this product I didn't ...): Love this! Great price for this product I didn't need it for fancy gaming or massive speed, I just needed it to do Google Sheets Google Slides and use the internet and print things for my Young Living business. Does exactly the job I needed for a very great price.",0
"(good quality and functionality): As advertised, good quality and functionality.",0
"(Meh): Overall it's pretty solid. I've had this laptop for about 2 months now and don't use it often but when I do it's almost always for gaming. I like the graphics for GTA5, Rocket League, and Fortnite as well as the videos played from my streaming services and external dvd player. What I don't like is the extremely short play time I get from the battery and the fact that this small white line suddenly appeared in the middle of the screen.I thought that perhaps I had accidentally scratched the screen at some point and didn't notice but after turning it off and looking at in the light I know that it's coming from INSIDE the screen not a blemish on the exterior. This makes for a bit of a distraction while watching videos. Wanted to give it a higher rating but I just expected more.*UpdateI changed my rating to 3 stars because, after 9 months of moderate use, I am now getting a ""no bootable device"" error when I turn it on. Tried updating the BIOS settings but it didn't work. Will have to find a repair shop near me.",0
(Not 144hz): I recently got one as a gift and it’s great and all but the screen is not 144hz. Will be returning it.,0
(Happy customer): Great gaming experience for the price,0
"when playing video games, the fans run even at higher speeds, w/o pressing on the area it will make that weird sound and will be really loud when pressed on",0
(I love this laptop): fast to boot up. fast with multiple windows open. wonderful screen with sharp resolution. great sound bar speakers with one button to push to raise/lower/mute volume (most other brands you have to push two buttons at once - Fn + another button. A great price for a great laptop. I would highly recommend this product.,0
It comes with a beautiful screen with a higher than average resolution of 1920 x 1080,0
(good quality I will rather to put my money on ...): good quality I will rather to put my money on the Zenbook rather then Macbook I saved some money,0
(Solo duró 1 año mi dinero a la basura ...NO LA RECOMENDÓ A NADIEEE): Estoy muy molesta con esta compra solo me duro un Año la compre en agosto del 2018 y ya no trabaja 😡😡😡 no la RECOMIENDO,0
(Way too limited - will order something else): I goofed- cant use Excel- only Google Programs. .Screen quality too dim. Miss touch screen. Gave this a shot- not for me.,0
"(picture quality is very good.): Nice product, as usual for Apple!",0
It just appeared out of the blue today,0
"(It’s good quality, money well spent.): It’s very good quality. I recommend it, I used it for zoom chats and Netflix and for about everything you can imagine it’s quick it’s a normal size. It’s a bout a clipboard long. And it’s very light weight. It has a charger and it’s modern.",0
(Great starter computer): I bought this for my 8 year old and it’s perfect for him. I own a photography business and wouldn’t recommend this for photo editing at all but it is a great starter computer/child’s computer!,0
(Great quality): I love the quality and ease of using,0
"(PLEASE DO NOT BUY RAZER .laptops break and they will not repair or return): The entire Razer experience was terrible. The USB port on my machine snapped after 5 weeks. I sent it for repair, I was told I had to pay $1300 dollars for it to be fixed. When I declined I heard nothing for 8 days. On live chat I was stalled and told they would come back to me. They never did. When I went on for the 5th time a manage offered me 25% discount.. so $900 to repair a piece of plastic on a 5 week old machine. I have asked for it to be returned.. I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BACK. So Razer have my laptop and are holding me to ransom. WORST WORST WORST - on top of that the machine itself was only average for the money.",0
"(Great bang for the buck!): Ordered 4 for my parents business to have some inexpensive laptops and couldn’t be happier. Super light (way lighter than an iPad with pelican case), super long battery life, ok browsing speed for a great price.I ended up ordering an other one just to keep it at home for whatever...",0
"(Great laptop for the price.): Great high performing laptop for the price. I was looking around for a new laptop to replace my almost a decade old laptop and this is a perfect replacement. It is probably one of the best laptops out there for the price range especially with what it comes with. I don't play a lot of games that require heavy use of the GPU, but the RTX 2070 is doing wonders to my gaming experience. I am not usually to keen on using laptop keyboards but the steel series keyboard offers a very tactile feel. The webcam it comes with only has a 720p resolution but it does the job when it comes to online video calls.Pros:Lightning quick start upAwesome 144hz screenCustomizable colors on the RGB KeyboardTactile KeyboardHDMI/mini display port for additional monitorsGood build qualityCons:Cooling fans can get loud while gaming (a headset can drown the noise out though)Large and heavy power supplyOverall, it is a great laptop and I am very happy it. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for gaming laptop.",0
(laptop getting hot while playing games): screen freezing when windows loading,0
(Great buy!): Better than expected!,0
"(Waste of money): I got this refurbished, was expecting it to last a little longer than 2 months. It now costs more to repair than I purchased it for. Don't waste your time and money.",0
"(Our family recommends this if you prefer one that isn't touchscreen.): I have an Asus Flip Chromebook. My husband did not want a touchscreen, so we ordered this one for him. He loves it. It's a wonderful little machine. He likes that you can see it, the display is clear, and it's easy to use. (by the way, I love my Asus Flip - also available on Amazon).",0
(VERY Disappointed): Never will buy Chromebook again. Also issues with touch screen. Really upset I cant return or exchange it.,0
"(A computer with a camera): A very modern computer with an on screen camera to see zoom and go to meetings, etc.",0
"(Good Basic): This is a good, basic laptop for work or homework.I got this for the resident 11 year old. She handled all the set up herself - I didn't have to touch it - so it's pretty easy and intuitive to set up.Does not have the power/speed for intense gaming, but works well for streaming.She's happy with this.",0
"(FAST): I feel this laptop was well worth the money, very fast and runs every game maxed out at at least 100fps or more.Build quality is top notch. Only con I can really think of with this laptop while using it for a few weeks is the speakers kinda suck and could have been better.",0
(Great value): Love this machine. For the money can’t be beat. Not great hi def. but really clear and a great product.,0
"(Happy with it after a few settings changes): Loving it so far but the auto adjusting screen brightness is super annoying. You have to go into the BIOS (hold delete on startup) then click setup bios > display and turn off adaptive brightness and that fixes it. If the webcam was on top of the screen and with this settings fix, it would be a pretty perfect machine. Will update after having it for a bit.",0
(Decent laptop): Great computer for basic needs.,0
(Great work from home laptop): Love this as work from home laptop. Screen is great size.,0
(Love my laptop!): I am super pleased with this laptop. It runs quickly and quietly. Doesn’t throw much heat. Graphics are great. Big Bang for my buck. Only thing I don’t like is when the keyboard back light goes out it is hard to see the keys.,0
the fans get quite loud at load,0
"(Gaming Computer with all you need): I have always liked Asus gaming computers because they are easy to upgrade. This computer comes complete with 16GB RAM and a decent SSD BUT with the ability to change out as needed. The keyboard feels great and has all the keys (mute, volume, armory, etc.) that you need.",0
"(Just over 3 months, dead battery?): I only used this chromebook for about a month. It didn't work well with Zoom meetings so I used it for reading ebooks and went back to my old Acer for zoom mtgs. I use my kindle fire for ebooks so I left the Chromebook 15 in the closet for 2 months, took it out and it wouldn't charge. Got a new charger, no luck. I missed my return window so I couldn't return it. Called Acer, gave up after 30 minutes.",0
(A good student chrome book): My son love it.,0
(Price): Wifi keep disconnected!!,0
The sound is on the weak side,0
"(Screen sensitivity): In general it functions well. Unfortunately the touch screen is not sensitive enough. I previously used a Lonovo Yoga Book which was much more sensitive. Whether this is a Chromebook issue or computer issue is unknown. However, it can be irritating.",0
(No as advertised): I WISH I would have read the Q&A on this device- NO backlit keyboard and quit advertising this feature. Computer is similar to a toy and I will be sending it back,0
This machine could handle 4k renders in Maya while editing texture maps in Photoshop.,0
(Great for middle and high schoolers): Great deal for the price. It’s perfect for school work.,0
I bought this laptop because it looks professional,0
(Bien para empezar): Bien,0
I do think it is a bit limited on the overall number of ports--everything is on the left side aside from the headphone jack,0
"(One year later, haven't regretted this purchase once.): One year update.I bought this to replace my dinosaur Asus N53SV on a budget. After 5 years, it was still playing the latest demanding games without complaining, and the only problem being a dead battery, I decided to stick with Asus and see if their Zenbooks held up just as well.Long story short, yes. Expectations exceeded.The first thing I noticed out of the box was the quality. The aluminum body is sleek and beautiful and just puts the Macbook Air to shame, IMO. It's incredibly light and just the right size to fit on your lap. And even considering that, it's surprisingly durable. This thing has taken two or three major falls (including one where it was dropped 4 feet onto tile, hit in the corner hard enough to totally bend the metal) and keeps on going like nothing happened.The keyboard is a huge improvement over the one on my old Asus laptop; it takes little effort to type and has a satisfying click. The adjustable backlight is a great bonus.The touchpad, on the other hand, is another story. This is one of the few criticisms I can even make about it, but it can make the laptop a little frustrating to use at first. It took me months to understand just where to touch to use the right-click function, and spent some time annoyed when I'd try to open a link in a new window just to end up clicking on it instead. Once I adjusted to this, it was fine, but it took longer than it should have.My only other gripe is the screen. The matte finish is lovely and the wide viewing angle has come in handy far more often than I thought it would. However, the subtleties in darker tones tend to get lost...pictures of my black cat look more like a silhouette. It's not bad in most situations if I turn the brightness all the way up, but it can make editing pictures a little less accurate.Where this laptop really impressed me is performance. My old Asus was a quad-core i7 with a good dedicated graphics card, and the UX330 slaps the crap out of it (until you really push it with graphics). I can go from opening the laptop to being on the desktop and ready to go within 10 seconds. It's responsive like a sports car and doesn't hesitate to do what you ask. It multitasks like a champ. I was worried that the integrated graphics meant no more games for me, but it hardly even stutters when playing The Sims 3 on a huge open world.Honestly, my only regret is not saving a little more so I could buy an even better Zenbook. But for $750, I almost feel like I stole this laptop.",0
(Excelente): Buen producto,0
(Do not waste your money this is a piece of crap and high way robbery): Not functional,0
"(Great computer. Fast and powerful. Battery is lacking but charges fast. Backlit keyboard, no rgb.): I don’t normally write reviews but I think this laptop deserves it. For the price it really is the most bang for your buck laptop you can find. I’ve been using it for about a month and I’ve had no issues. The most demanding games I’ve run so far are Doom Eternal and Divinity 2 on the highest setting and they’ve ran with absolutely no problem. I plan on playing Cyberpunk 2077 on it if it ever comes out, so we’ll see if it can handle that. The only negative thing about this computer is the battery life. You’ll definitely either have to keep it plugged in or keep the charger handy, which I have no problem with. I’d say the battery would maybe last 1-2 hours on the highest setting. Charging is extremely fast though from 0% to 100% in maybe 30 minutes. It has a backlit keyboard, no RGB lights. The screen resolution and brightness are phenomenal. All in all I’ve had a very good experience and I would definitely recommend it.",0
(Not a good choice for distance learning!): Waste of money. Bought this for my son’s distance learning and audio functions are not compatible with video platforms such as Zoom.,0
"(Warning): Great laptop for gaming with a 144 monitor,Everything was awesome after a few days after warranty expired CPU stock at 0.79.Some BIOS update messed up the cpu mb sensor.still works but be carefull with this mb.",0
"(Well priced basic laptop): After a couple months of use by my teenagers, the laptop seems to be holding up very well. It is responsive enough with Windows 11 for basic schoolwork or web browsing. Like the screen size and resolution. I initially had a concern that the laptop was not charging properly, but using the battery controller reset on the bottom seems to have solved the problem, it has been working well for several months now.",0
"(Low Disk Space Creates Such a Headache): I purchased this last year when ASUS was selling the 2gb raam/ 32gb emcc (however, the storage space on my computer says my C drive only has 28gb total).Due to this low disk space, I have been unable to download the last several Microsoft updates. The windows OS is literally eating up 18 gb, the preinstalled apps 4.2gb, and the temp files, 3.45gb. That leaves me with a whopping 3 gb of space (definitely not enough to update, even with an external usb memory stick...nor can I reimage/factory reset my device due to low disk space). I have spent hours on the phone with Microsoft support, and they finally decided to send me a fresh usb with the latest windows.I am astounded ASUS would manufacture a device that can't handle the OS it comes pre-installed, but I guess it's my own fault for buying a device with such tiny memory. Lesson definitely learned. It looks like they updated to 64gb memory now, so hopefully new buyers won't have this problem, but I wish ASUS would do something for those of us who purchased the model with smaller memory and are now stuck with an essentially broken device.If it weren't for the disk space issue, I would be quite happy with this little device. It's sleek and great for writing, basic internet usage, and even some streaming/low demand games.",0
(Easy to carry): Loved the zenbook for its lightness and easy to carry. Good battery life. It will be better if ssd drive can can be higher capacity.,0
(Travel aid of the first rate): This is just the right size when you have to run around to a bunch of meetings and need a good lap top.,0
(Garbage): This stopped working after 6 months of use. Do not buy.,0
(Great laptop): Love it,0
"(Good computer, but rather heavy): I'm a Mac guy, but I needed a Windows machine with good graphics capabilities. This fits the bill. It's an excellent computer - fast and responsive, and with ample drive space, memory and ports. The primary negative is that it's heavy, and I need to use it as a laptop and travel with it. If it mostly sits on your desk or you just move it at home from one surface to another, then it works very well as a desktop substitute.",0
(Seller swore it had a Cardbus slot. It does NOT.): Good laptop overall. However seller lied about it having a CardBus slot. Which is the only reason I bought it.,0
"(Great laptop for the price): This laptop is a great deal at $1,199. I did a lot of shopping around before purchasing it and I couldn't be happier. Zero problems and I have been astounded by the workload this PC can handle.My only complaint is a 512GB hard drive is a little small for gamers, but there is an open 2.5"" slot which is easily accessible.",0
"(Awesome!!!): We were always diehard HP users, but got tired of their system glitches. We bought our first ASUS for our son's digital schooling. It was such a great computer that I did not hesitate to buy one for myself when my HP conked out. I'm glad I did because it is fantastic!",0
"(Battery dead after 3 months): I did almost newer use this laptop on battery, now it cannot charge the battery anymore it tells me that I have to replace it. It already the second laptop from hp that has this problem.",0
"(Gaming pc): So far so good, I played a couple of games (warzone, kena, tales of arise, resident evil 7, nier replicant) and no issues. The main thing will be the fan noise but I'm use to it. Maybe getting a cooling stand will be an option.",0
"(Great): This laptop was for my daughter she loves it , it is fast and perfect for her needs",0
(One Star): the screen broke a month after i had it.,0
"(Good with some cons...): Good laptop- powerful (i9 /3070 ti),- good quality,- good sound,- good screen,- nice keyboard except for PrintScreen key which is very misplace - too close from right arrow.but:- massive and heavy 180W external charger - even for a such powerful laptop...- lot of issues with a fresh reinstall even with all Asus drivers installed. => 23 drivers to install, => powercfg /energy issues, => online support almost useless, got only one reply... ""Reinstall"",- sleeping mode is difficult and still always draining ~ 10 - 15 Watts,- useless Keystone - A security key would have been more appropriate,- and always warm on the legs...I'm coming from Gigabyte Aorus 15XD (3070) that I returned it because shift keys were not backlit and the Aorus had better performance on CyberPunk 2077 benchmark with ""only"" an 3070, heated less and had no drivers issues with a fresh reinstall...So my opinion is therefore mixed...---Update:Move my review from 3 to 4 stars.=> powercfg /energy issues are not coming from ASUS but from Microsoft (Windows 11)=> online support is difficult but if you insist you will have a better reply",0
"(Great Laptop!): I bought this laptop to replace my old gaming desktop as well as be mobile with it as I travel. It worked great right out of the box. Setup was super fast and easy! Most games I can run at ultra settings! Video editing and photo editing work just great. I id notice some lag when I had too many tabs open when I'm doing research but it may be software issues on my end. I intend to add another 8 GB of memory soon and pop in a 1TB SSD soon. This laptop works great! Battery though isn't the greatest but it's to be expected on a beast of a machine!UPDATE 7/31/20: Laptop still running good, however the Webcam is no longer detected for some reason. I've tried restarts, reinstalling drivers, enabling and disabling the hardware but it's like it doesn't exist. I don't want to go through the hassle of replacement as I use it for writing and I don't feel like moving everything again, so I'll get a USB Webcam in the future. Other than that, it's still working good!",0
"(Whacha wanna play?): Absolute beast, can get hot to the touch during longer sessions though. There is no game it can't run well...",0
(Love it): I love my laptop. The colour is beautiful and executive. Great quality.,0
"When you hit the function key, the function keys light up which is a cool touch.",0
"(You're going to need Headphones, but generally pretty good!): For it's price, this laptop does it's job fairly well! Upon first opening the box it was immediately easy to smudge the top of the laptop, as shown in the photos, but I don't personally care about its outward appearance. The actual laptop was very functional and easy to use right upon opening it. When it comes to getting a gaming laptop, I put it through some stress tests, first of which is Skyrim special edition on ultra graphics. And to my delightful surprise, it ran it lag free! but this is where I encountered one of my 2 gripes with this laptop, the fans were SO loud! But I just put on a pair of headphones and didn't really notice them anymore. The second problem I encountered was its battery life! while playing spore on high graphics, which aren't that taxing on a normal computer, the battery lasted 1 hour... Put simply the battery is bad, but if you keep it plugged in as you play any game, it will work fine! In conclusion, this computer has a total of 2 issues, and both of them are easily fixable! Absolutely love this laptop so far!",0
"(Good): Run quite well, nothing much to say",0
"(Everything and more...): Sleek design, awesome keyboard setup, exceptional graphics quality and sound. This is a great gaming computer as well as everyday work as a graphics designer. I am very impressed with the overall qualities and features this computer gives me. I highly recommend and would buy again.",0
the top of the laptop gets really hot even intolerable to the touch,0
The lag time when using touch was so bad that it would leave the user searching while giving a description several second later,0
"(Do not recommend! Find something better, you get what you paid for!): This laptop is extremely limited! No drive, space, cannot download certain software, no cd rom drive! This laptop is made for kids, that’s how basic it is!",0
"(It is amazing; I enjoy HP products): It is so light weight and fast. It is amazing; I enjoy HP products, the printer 8720 as well. It is so easy to fax, scan and print with it.",0
(Good laptop): It functions just fine as a computer. But as soon as I got it and updated the drivers the touchpad stopped working. I've tried all sorts of solutions I've found on the internet to fix the situation. I've been given a couple different links to drivers directly on the Lenovo website but they don't fix the issue. Had to buy a usb wireless mouse.,0
(Five Stars): This chrome book is very good everything works when you get it. I suggest people to get it.,0
(Good for the price): Comes with Windows 10. Not my favorite platform,0
(Un gran producto de APPLE): Soy usuario de los productos apple y realmente considero que son productos excelentes,0
I find the screen opens and closes very smooth with the right amount of tension and the hinges are very sturdy,0
"(Awesome): This laptop is great! The best bang for the buck, and it cost quite a few bucks...",0
(Cant download anything and vudu.com movies wont play): Beware if u use sites like VUDU.com. I have over 40 movies on VUDU but can't watch on this. Apparently according to Samsung you can't download any apps or movies even tho you tube is already on here.,0
(Good for non-gaming.): Not best for gaming but amazing laptop.,0
"(Cheapest components in this build!): Had high hopes for this laptop, but it is built with the cheapest components available, yet sold as a premium Asus machine with a premium price tag. I mean really an Intel 660p SSD...",0
"(Screen Not Ready for Primetime): I'd love to give this laptop a better review, but I can't, because it never got past the initial setup. The first one I received within a couple of minutes had numerous discolored vertical lines in a two inch slice of the screen, which persisted through reboots and were visible in BIOS and in a separate boot environment. The replacement I received looks to have been previously returned based on the manufacturer tape being split and covered with regular shipping tape, and it too had a screen issue. Backlight bled up from the bezel, which may not be a dealbreaker if this was a $300 laptop, but I'm not paying $1800 for a laptop with a screen with ANY defects.Once is a fluke, two in a row is probably indicative of a manufacturing problem.I have an existing Asus ROG laptop and have used Asus parts for numerous gaming desktops, but this quality control issue is seriously worrying. I would not recommend buying this for another generation or two.",0
(Clearance for a reason!): Very slow processor and annoying cursor delay!,0
"(Missing parts had to pay extra smh): I received my product today however when I opened the box the laptop was there but it was missing the adopter and power cord when I called customer service for Amazon all they suggested was I return and then reorder, I explained that this was not possible because I need this laptop for business purposes, so unable to return and file for a refund I am forced to purchase the adapter and power cord separately I paid even more money plus shipping and handling despite already paying $350 already smh this is unacceptable how did ACER EMPLOYEES not notice they put the computer in the box without the adapter or power cord how do amazon and Acer expect me to charge and use the laptop if I do not have the two most main important components!If I get this thing up and running I will I didn't my review to see how well it works or not!",0
"(Has 8gb of memory contrary to uneducated reviews): If you don't know anything about computers, don't write a review speaking about specs. This computer has the 8gb of memory as stated. 4gb on board, 4gb on a stick. That adds up to 8 I think. Snappy little computer. Got it for my 9 year old to do his zoom stuff for school. Thanks libs.Don't expect it to blow you out of the water, but more than capable at a price point that doesn't hurt. Highly recommend. This is my first anything but an HP laptop. So far, so good.",0
(Three Stars): It is ok. I prefer my old laptop. The upgrade is not substantial enough to impress me.,0
(Very useful utility item.): It is being used for school work.,0
(It works great!): I would recommend this to anyone who just likes surfing the web. It works great!,0
"(DOA and Amazon's usually outstanding customer service fails): During setup, noticed an icon telling me it's missing updates. Went to settings; said updates pending. Clicking on the update icon did nothing, so clicked on Help, selected updates; it then said it can't tell if it's updated, and to call customer service. I tried restarting it; been ""restarting"" ever since. Called ASUS, and am told it's best to charge it for 8 hours before initial use (despite the menu I actually read saying merely to charge for 3 hrs prior to using it in battery mode for the first time). Was 80% charged when this crash occurred, so I don't see the connection.Amazon says they can't replace it, have to get a refund and repurchase, which is not great since it was on sale and can't be had for the price I paid 2 days ago.Should I mention Amazon packaged it with a 5lb protein powder canister careening around inside a larger box, with absolutely nothing protecting the computer inside its thin cardboard box, nor anything holding the canister in place so it doesn't bounce around into the computer?Total team failure.",0
(Christmas Present): I got this for my nephew for Christmas ! I was very surprised with the quality especially since I didn’t spend that much money on it ! I love it! I hope he loves it as well,0
"(Baja calidad del display o lotería de display, 2 pixeles muertos en este momento con 8 meses de uso): 1 pixel muerto desde que llegó a colombia y uno más 6 meses después la garantía internacional no cubre la reparación ya que no tienen los insumos, aunque si lo llevo a un centro de reparación y pago si tienen el panel :/ no recomiendo esta compra si es afuera de estados unidos por la lotería con el panel",0
"(High temperatures): The laptop is great! It runs very well and smooth every game I've tried on it... However it get really hot! Temperatures go above 90 degrees, but it can be fixed by undervolting the battery a little without loosing performance.",0
"(Unhinged): All my laptops (3) are Lenovo...they're workhorses. Primary use, mobile DJ. The one weakness has been the hinges on which the screen rotates when you open it. They crack and fall apart long before the laptop comes close to its demise. This seems to have been fixed...instead of flimsy plastic, apparently there's a metal rod, covered with plastic, on which the screen rotates open/closed.",0
(Works great): This works great and fits all of my needs.,0
(GOOD): I really enjoy my Chromebook. It is responsive and easy to use.,0
"(Beautiful design, but there are some issues): Let me begin by stating that we are a Dell family. I've had several XPS laptops and an Inspiron desktop over the years, and my children all have Alienware desktop computers. So, when I was asked to review the Dell G15 5520 15.6 Inch Gaming Laptop, I went in expecting to fall in love with it. Regrettably, I did not. I waited two months to write this review, hoping that the problems I was having were software-related and that installing all of the updates I could find would solve my problems. There have been two BIOS updates and a slew of other updates since I received this laptop. I installed every required and recommended update, and I kept other software installations to a minimum. I only installed a video conferencing app and a pdf reader from trusted brands. But this laptop keeps crashing. I have had at least 10 blue screens. Furthermore, I had to reinstall Windows because when I started the laptop, it would state that Windows did not load properly, and restarting the PC only helped for a short time.I've had a number of problems since the beginning. For example, even though the settings are set so that the laptop should sleep when I close the lid, it appears to keep running as the battery drains. I'll go to bed with a fully charged laptop, only to wake up with one that's at 0%. I tried leaving it plugged in, but it gets so hot that I'm afraid it's dangerous. Speaking of how hot it gets, even when doing simple tasks like editing a text document or slides, it appears to work so hard that it is burning up. It's better when it's not plugged in, but I can only get about 2.30 hours out of it on battery power alone, which isn't great. So I've been using this laptop exclusively with a constantly running cooler pad. I can see why this is required for serious gaming, but for light text editing? On top of everything else, my screen began to display multicolored lines last week as well. I thought that was it, but I haven't seen any this week, so fingers crossed.There are a few features on this laptop that I do enjoy. The design is wonderful. My husband is in the army, and the design is identical to his uniform, so I thought this laptop would make an excellent gift for him. I also like that there is a separate numeric keypad. That was missing from my XPS laptops. It took me a few days to get used to typing more to the left, but once I did, I was hooked. I also like how simple it is to turn the keyboard lights on and off. When I try to work at night, the light definitely helps. Another feature I appreciate is the Dell update app on the laptop. You don't really need to go to their website to get necessary updates anymore. Overall, if it weren't for the technological issues, I think this would be a fantastic laptop. However, based on my recent experiences as well as the weight of this laptop and the power brick, I still prefer my XPS, even if she is a little older.",0
"(Excelente equipo, gran capacidad en todo sentido y por un super precio!): El equipo llegó en perfectas condiciones, incluso se adelantó un día en la llegada.Viene excelentemente equipado con el procesador de ultima generación y en serie HQ que lo hace mas potente para los graficos, ademas la tarjeta de video que incluye es de gran rendimiento. El almacenamiento tambien es super bueno, con disco en estado solido de 256 GB y disco duro de 1TB.Excelente compra, además de ser muy liviano y tener un gran diseño sobrio!!!",0
"(buen producto): me encantó, relación precio producto satisfactorio",0
(Excelente equipo): Muy buen equipo y el precio excelente. Se ve de buena calidad. Muy a gusto con mi compra,0
(Great machine. Top of the line. Super unit for games or normal use.): Great machine. Top of the line. Super unit for games or normal use. Current technology. Only complaint it the touch pad is the same color and texture as the keyboard surface and hared to locate without looking at it.,0
(Small easy to carry): Love that it's so small it makes it easy to bring around,0
"(Very good, for less money!): Quality laptop for less money. I am really satisfied with this purchase! Like new.",0
"(Recomendado): Cosmetically impecable, sin fallas, óptima funcionalidad hasta este momento de uso",0
"(Excellent laptop; expandability and battery could be better): This thing is named right. It is swift. I have been impressed with this little machine, especially the i7-1165G7 CPU. For its size and the price, it outperforms some of the other, more expensive gaming laptops I have. Here's what I thought. WHAT I LOVESIZE:This is a thin and light laptop that lives up to its name. It's very easy to grab this laptop with one hand and, although not recommended, carry it under your arm. It is very light and thin.PERFORMANCE:For such a small footprint, this thing really performs. I was very impressed with the i7-1165G7 chip that comes with Intel's Iris Xe graphics. I ran some benchmarks (see images) in Geekbench 5, comparing it against two gaming laptops and a Dell Inspiron. And while it can't compete with the Inspiron, the CPU actually beats the other two gaming laptops I have that were both purchased within the past year. There's also the integrated Iris graphics. While you wouldn't expect an iGPU to be competitive with dedicated graphics, this little thing is nothing to skoff at. Out of curiosity, I loaded Far Cry 5 to see if it was playable with the Iris graphics, and I was able to get an average approaching 50 frames per second with lowered settings. This would've been unthinkable on previous integrated Intel graphics.RAM AND BOOT SPEEDS:The first thing that actually blew me away about this little laptop is the startup speed. I have 7 PCs and all of them have either SATA or NVMe SSDs for booting. However, none of them come even close to how quickly this laptop boots. I timed the startup from total shutdown to Windows desktop at between around 5-6 seconds. Unbelievable! The SSD measured at around 2100MB/s read and 1150MB/s write, which is not even close to the fastest NVMe speeds I've seen. To explain the quickness of this laptop, I have to chalk it up to how well it's built and the speed of the RAM, which runs at a speedy 4200Mhz. WHAT I DON'T LOVEBATTERY:When I first saw this laptop, I was excited to see that the advertised battery length was up to 16 hours! And I understand that -- for the most part -- you're not going to get what is advertised. Usually, you're lucky to get about 60-70% of that, but I'd be more than happy to have 12 hours of battery. My other laptops, which all advertise 8 hours of battery, I'm lucky to get 5 hours of battery life. But, that's where I was really disappointed. The most I've gotten out of this battery is about 8-9 hours. Usually, I'm right around 5 hours (see image) and this is only using Chrome to read websites and chat via Slack. What happened Acer? Why are they advertising 16 hours. There's no scenario I could do that would get me 16 hours, unless I turned the display off and ran no applications at all. This isn't real-world. I would be happier with advertised battery life of up to 10 hours. That's fine, but this makes me question other specs.UPGRADEABILITY & CONNECTIVITY:The RAM is great. I love the speed, but why not allow us to upgrade? That RAM is soldered to the motherboard and they give us no options to upgrade -- whatsoever. So, you're stuck at 8GB. It would be so nice to bump this up to 16GB and use with Photoshop for my job; however, that will never happen so this laptop will forever stuck at 8GB. Very disappointing.It also would've been nice for Acer to include a microSD slot. The quickest way to upgrade your storage -- and add mobility to that storage -- is via a microSD card. However, there is no slot so you'll be forced to buy a reader and attach it to USB if you want that capability. The rest of the connectivity is adequate. There is no ethernet connection, but there is a full HDMI port, which is a nice touch for a thin & light, and there are also two USB-A ports and a USB-C port, which has full Thunderbolt 4 support and can charge the laptop as well. THE REST-Everything else on the laptop is adequate.-The WiFi works fine. I measured 80Mbps downloads from my ISP on this compared with 105Mbps from my desktop, which is ethernet. So, while it's not nearly as fast as a wired connection. It's adequate.-The Bluetooth 5.1 seems to work well.-The display is fine for 14"". It's full HD at 60Hz and has a full brightness of 300 nits, which is fine.-The keyboard feels just OK, but has VERY little key travel. It's 14"" so there is no numpad; however, it would have been nice for Acer to try and fit in full-size arrow keys, even at the expense of other keys. I can't tell you how many times I've press arrow up or down and ended up hitting page up or down. I really hate those small arrow keys, but I guess sacrifices had to be made.-The facecam is about what you would expect. Not great quality, but good enough for Zoom meetings, etc.-The speakers actually sound pretty decent and you're able to make out lower frequencies pretty well, even if they are buried a bit. The stereo separation is nice, but you'll have to crank that volume up, though, as anything below around 70% is nearly inaudible thanks to the speakers being located on the bottom of the unit. OVERALL-Overall, this is an excellent laptop that is quite fast and powerful, especially for its size. It charges fairly quickly, is very lightweight and despite a few missing bells and whistles, is just about everything you'd want in a thin & light. Five stars.",0
"(Four Stars): fast, for what i needed",0
"(All good. Great laptop): All good. Great laptop. perfect size and decent battery life. Exactly what I needed. My only problem is that the fan sometimes makes some noise and gets heated up pretty fast, and it's just my second day! It would make some noise for a few mins and then go back to normal. I'm just pretty concerned that it's only my second day of using it..",0

"(A great gaming laptop): After 12 months of owning this, i can say it was a very nice and solid choice of a laptop for the price i got it for (1000$).+ The Pros:- Slick design that doesn't scream gamer.- The laptop build is solid.- Keyboard is pleasant to type on.- Nice and vibrant screen.- Plays anything i throw at it with ease (@1080p 60fps on god of war. 120+ fps apex legends. 90+ fps monster hunter rise. 200+ fps divinity original sin).- Runs cool, CPU and GPU doesn't exceed 75c in most demanding games/applications (if you apply the tips below).- Decent 4.5 hours battery life.- The Cons:- The 3050ti is actually great but the 4gb of vram might prevent you from choosing very high textures in games or could be an issue if you try to render super heavy scenes in 3d softwares that require alot of vram. (For me it was enough to run Lumion 3D without issues and it never exceeded 4GB)- My unit has high pitched fans so it's loud under load.Tips to reduce your CPU and GPU temperatures on the laptop:1- Have the back of your laptop raised by few centimeters to allow more air into the vents. (3 to 5c lower temps)2- Play on balanced mode instead of Performance, you will get lower temps (by up to 10c) and not much performance is lost (5% to 10% at worst, at least that's what i saw with my games.)3- Disable boost, this had minor impact on my fps but i had cooler temps on my ryzen 5800h temps (14c lower temps).To disable boost follow steps below:– Run cmd as administrator and type in:powercfg -attributes sub_processor perfboostmode -attrib_hideThis will reveal a setting ""Processor performance boost mode"" in the advanced options in your power plan settings that lets you enable or disable boost.– If you want to Undo the previous operationpowercfg -attributes sub_processor perfboostmode +attrib_hide– Configure it in your preferred power plan:Control Panel/Power Options/Change Plan Settings/Change advanced power settings/Processor power management/Processor performance boost modeWhile Disabled (Default: Aggressive) your thermals will improve drastically with minimal or zero performance lost depending on the game.If you don't want to completely disable it use Efficient Aggressive.Note that disabling boost reduces performance when doing demanding non-gaming workloads like rendering (mostly CPU workloads), so disable it if you want max performance at the cost of more heat.[Review updated with pictures showing temperature improvements for both CPU (Ryzen 7 5800H) and GPU (3050TI) using the tips above running Monster Hunter Rise]",0

"(It's OK for what it costs.): I bought this, and a few spares, for a 'don't care what happens to it' laptop for road trips, gifts, etc.I want it to surf, play netflix, and update my social status while travelling.It does this. Much better than the Dell Crap-top I tried first (Inspiron 14"" something).Sure you gotta navigate the Android enviro... but it seems to be much faster and stable than Win10.If you want a GOOD laptop, get a Dell XPS13 when on sale.If you need a crap-top, this is fine.",0

"(Great Buy! I love it!): I love my product, this the 5 stars, but I will just need to critique the company real quick. When I ordered this model, apparently they didn’t have it in stock anymore so they sent me the newest version with no additional cost. Which was great!... But here’s the critique- it was a different color and at first I freaked out because I wasn’t sure if I’d like the Poseidon blue color versus the dark ash color I had preferred and ordered. The company sent Poseidon blue without checking with me first. They sent me an email saying they didn’t have dark ash color anymore and that they could send me the newer (late 2020) Poseidon blue model instead, but I’d have to reply soon. They didn’t wait for my approval and shipped the Poseidon blue color within an hour, even though their initial email said I had up to 3 hours to reply. I’m not angry but something like this could just really be inconvenient.About the laptop:- it’s heavier than I expected and the fan can be a little loud (not THAT loud) here and there. I’m not used to that because my MAC is usually quiet and it very lightweight.-with that said it’s GORGEOUS, sleek looking and works great! So glad I bought it. I will say if you have big hands, this keyboard and touchpad setup may not be for you because the trackpad is relatively small and it’ll feel like your palms can’t rest on the laptop itself. I don’t know if This makes sense but definitely watch the reviews about it! They’re right.",0
"(A nice computer for a very small price.): I had a lot of trouble using an RCA version of a book but this Samsung Chromebook works wonderfully on Wi-Fi.

Samsung has a lot of speed compared to the RCA product that I had so much problems with.",0
"(HP Needs to recall these computers and fix the Mediakit - wifi receiver): I had the exact same wi-fi network issues as everyone else has mentioned. I bought this for graduate school and online classes - I need a more dependable wifi computer than this one. The Troubleshooting recommended attaching an ethernet chord, but there is no ethernet port to connect to on the laptop. I tried resetting my modem and restarting the computer multiple times, to no avail. The laptop isn't recognizing ANY network - phone hotpsot or internet modem. I tried registering it on HP and the product number cannot be found, so I was SOL on HP tech support too. I'm processing a return today.",0
"(Slow shipping, worth it.): Slow shipping. Great quality. My son wanted a laptop instead of a tablet. Apparently the same as the ones they use in his grade 5 class. Got it on sale black friday for a great price!",0
Key travel is decent and the keyboard is sufficient size for all but the meatiest fingers. Backlighting is GREAT. There are six RGB zones if you're into that sort of thing too.,0
"(Awesome laptop for the price): This laptop is, to use the professional term, ""the tits"". Outstanding specs for the price point, and easily upgraded (extra m.2 slot and ram are easily accessible) been running everything I play at max settings without any issues.",0
(Great value!): It is a great computer with a very nice processor (I bought the version with: i7-12700H processor).I am using it mostly for Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations and it is FAST! Just to give you an idea: A simulation that would take an hour on my old Lenovo Y50-70 now takes ~10 minutes!I've used it very little on gaming. I tried Assetto Corsa on the laptop. It works very well but I did notice it will overheat a bit. I strongly recommend also buying a cooler if you were to use it for gaming.Hope this will be useful!,0

It has handled Adobe suite, Lightburn, and running Easel all at the same time while connected to my CNC and Laser machine running jobs and it has not had any issues with heating up or the fans running due to heat. I love the brightness of the screen, and the fingerprint log in has worked with no issues. I was happy to know I can cast to my TVs, use my iPad as an extended screen. I definitely recommend this laptop.",0
"(Buy it!): Just what we needed it. We shopped around and decided on this one, and so happy we did. We travel a lot, that's we need a lightweight laptop. And this one has it all. Buy it!",0
(A very adequate moderately priced laptop for photo and video editting): A very convenient size and weight for the processing power it has. I replaced the RAM with two 16Gb chips to give plenty of overhead for Luminar 4 and other photo processing programs. With the easy addition of a second SSD with 1 TB of storage it is an excellent machine for my purposes.,0
(Faulty unit): The “ f” key was malfunctioning. I had to return it. Ordered another just like it and it works great.,0

(Great for work): Battery life is excellent. The screen quality it great. But there is no touch screen. Overall it gets the job done,0
"(Battery and Keyboard are awful): The keyboard is defective. Every time I press ""P"" key it gets stuck. The battery status sometimes drops suddenly (e.g. from 100% to 80% in just a second). I requested a return days ago, but the UPS is not coming to collect it, and the only return option they provide is UPS pickup, which sucks.",0
"(Latest Technology -- But Disappointing): I researched for a month, to replace my Dell XPS-13. I wanted a slightly larger screen (14 inch), longer battery life (after three years the XPS-13 still gives me 6 hours), fastest, latest chipset (assuming that it would yield fastest processing speed,) and a chance to try out an OLED screen. Unfortunately, all of what I was looking for was not available in one unit, so I settled on the Zenbook 14X, which had most of what I wanted.- I was hoping to get a laptop that met the EVO standard of displaying the home screen in a second or two after opening the lid, but the Zenbook usually takes 7-8 seconds to come to life.- OLED is evidently harder on battery life than LCD, so while the OLED display is nice (not dramatically nice, but nice,) it sucks out battery life. I can't get any more than about 6-7 hours, doing email and Facebook. Many of the new premium laptops today, which I thought I was getting, get 9, 10 or more hours.- The fancy ""Innovative ScreenPad 2.0: 5.65-inch interactive touchscreen trackpad"" was so frustrating and annoying to use that I finally just turned it off, and use it as a plain old trackpad to move the mouse cursor.- I really wanted the brand new Intel Core i7 Gen 12 chipset, assuming that it would provide fast processing speeds. Again, disappointed. The Asus isn't any faster than the old XPS-13. In fact, while some processes that I can't measure must surely be faster with the Zenbook, I was surprised that the simple process of loading an excel or PowerPoint file from the local 512GB SSD was quite a bit slower -- a simple little 40k Excel file takes 3 or 4 seconds to load from the SSD, where the XPS did it almost instantaneously. 3 or 4 seconds doesn't sound like much, but when you are using lots of different files, it can seem interminable. Larger PowerPoint files easily take 8-10 seconds to load.- The 14 inch screen is the size I was looking for -- can't complain about that. But while the OLED is nice, it is not nice enough to give up battery performance for.- The exterior finish of the Zenbook, whatever it is, shows every fingerprint and smudge. I really miss the very professional metallic finish on the XPS-13.- One advantage the Zenbook has is a much more robust set of I/O ports -- USB, HDMI, Audio out, etc., where Dell has chosen to eliminate most of that, so I/O points go to Asus.So, in summary, my attempt to replace my old XPS-13 cost about $1,500, has no better battery life, processes slower, loads and saves slower, and is physically less attractive. I've been an IT professional since before Windows version 1 was announced, and have lots of experience with excellent machines. The Zenbook 14X has some good specs, but all in all, it is much less that I was hoping for. If I had it to do all over again, I would not invest in the Zenbook 14X. I wish I could return it and start my search for a high quality, fast, professional laptop all over again.",0

"(I can't recommend this particular Asus gaming laptop, but I haven't lost faith in Asus): I purchased this laptop because I read more than one really good review about it and because I previously owned an Asus gaming laptop that worked almost flawlessly for more than 5 years. But things didn’t go well for me with this laptop.The first thing I noticed was that the SD card reader couldn’t detect any of my three SDHC cards, although it did detect my 2 Gb SD card. Not the biggest deal, but one big reason I chose this laptop over others is that it had a SD card reader, which is the easiest way to transfer photos and videos from my cameras. I contacted ASUS customer support about this, and they suggested that I update the BIOS. I did this to no avail. Then they suggested that I re-install Windows 10. I delayed doing this as long as possible because this would involve a few hours of re-downloading and re-installing all of the programs that I had already installed by this point. Eventually I relented and re-installed Windows, and as you might have guessed, this didn’t fix the problem either. I decided that I wasn’t going to go through the bother of returning the laptop just for the card reader, after all there are SD card adapters, but soon I encountered other problems.There were issues with the installed Armory Crate program that a few other reviewers said they experienced. When I finally got the most recent version of the program installed, there were multiple problems with the keyboard. For example, common keyboard shortcuts such and Ctrl-V (Paste) didn’t work and my keyboard backlighting profiles weren’t saved after turning off the laptop. I fixed the short-cut issue using a solution I found on Google, but I continued to have issues with saving lighting profiles.The laptop also made odd clicking sounds that sounded to me like a mechanical hard drive writing data. I knew this couldn’t be the source because I had replaced the mechanical hard drive that came with the laptop with an SSD. The sounds turned out to be what’s called “coil whine”, which has something to do with electrical current causing certain components on the motherboard to vibrate. The sounds were faint enough to tolerate, but definitely noticeable when the laptop was in “silent mode”. Not quite a deal breaker for me yet.Then about a week after I got the laptop, while I was just surfing the web, the cooling fans starting running full blast. After about 10 seconds of this the laptop powered down, and as I feared, wouldn’t power on again. At this point, I had had enough, and I didn’t spend much time trying to diagnose the issue. Even if I got it back up and running, I no longer had faith that it would be reliable, so I returned it for a refund.I wish I could recommend this particular laptop, but I can’t. There were just too many problems from the onset. If you’re going with an Asus gaming laptop, I recommend that you purchase a different model.Pros:• Beautiful sharp and bright screen• Good keyboard (for fast and prolonged typing)• Quiet fans when not gaming• Stays cool even when gaming• Responsive and respectful customer service• Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim runs on it smoothly at the highest settings (it’s the only game I tried)• Easy to upgrade• Solid buildCons:• SD card reader couldn’t read high capacity SDHC cards (didn’t try SDXC cards)• Some annoying issues with installed software• Persistent coil whine• Really loud and annoying start-up sound but you can disable it from the BIOS• It died on me after a week",0
"(Amazing - better than my other gaming laptops): I felt compelled to write a review for this amazing laptop. I used to use an Acer Predator, and this is cheaper and far superior. It's lightning fast, amazing image quality, doesn't get hot, and has a respectable battery life. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a new laptop.",0
"(my first I5 love it): i love the SSD and the I5. not too crazy about windows 11. Their passion for one drive and how they removed functionality from standard utilities like photos.exe. But, I love the computer, especially the boot time (<10 seconds)",0
(It's fast): It's everthing we thought it would be,0
"(Perfect size for what I needed): First Chromebook and bought this to carry on motorcycle road trips and other travels. Perfect size for what I needed, and enjoy the keyboard versus a touch screen. Easier to pack than my laptop and seems rugged enough to withstand a few bumps now and then. Price was reasonable for my needs..Works fine and the battery certainly lasts longer than my laptop does.",0
"(Mi ASUS TUF Dash 15): De momento todo marcha bien. He jugado Fortnite sin ningún problema. Pero admito que consume la batería rápido, especialmente durante juegos o aplicaciones que demandan capacidad grafica y no se encuentra conectada. Aunque es Totalmente normal",0
"(Great Laptop!!!): I purchase this laptop as a self-gift, totally enjoy it!",0
"(It's an Apple product, so what's not to love?): Like every Apple product, this is top notch. The original M1 chip is clearly outstanding, the speeds are phenomenal, and the batter life is tremendous. Certainly no complaints here!",0
(Works great): Yeah right off the box light bleading like in other reviews but not an issue for me easy to add one more nvme and ssd. Te battery in game mode is bad bit thats to be expected and yeas the turbo air is loud but again it does the job great,0
"(Acer Chromebook): The Computer started out as a great Christmas present. By May the mouse did not work on one of them. By October one of the 2 crashed and does not work with the other one showing similar symptoms.Called Amazon Customer service, they put me onto Acer. Called Acer 7 x and got the run around each time i called them. Was suppose to deal with a level 2 tech, and each time i was given the run around with them too.Then called Amazon back which i was told they wouldnt do anything and that i had to deal with Acer.Incredibly this all happened with 7 days worth of warranty and nobody wants to except responsibility i assume because they want the warranty to run out and then both are off the hook. This all while the pandemic is speeding up and the kids having to learn from home is in the near future hence why i bought the computers in the first place.I have bought many items from Amazon over the years and i will say i will never again after this exp with both companies. Thanks for screwing the kids and their learning. GREAT JOB AMAZON & ACER",0
"(Great laptop… except when it isn’t.): I’m writing this a year after buying this laptop. Do not buy it, absolutely horrible quality laptop, I should have expected that though because of the price. Laptop battery rarely lasts more than 2 hours even at the lowest possible settings. CPU temp sits at a nice 94c when idle. And for some reason, the ONE audio port doesn’t work. And my favorite part, the battery is dying, after only a year of using it, I need to buy a new battery for $95",0
(Good for a 2nd home computer): I was kind of disappointed with the color quality on the screen. It was not as brilliant as I expected.,0
(Awful Mousepad. Wish I could return this!): the mouse is almost completely unresponsive and makes scrolling or browsing (the main purpose of this laptop) nearly impossible. I am not picky but this is unusable! Do not buy this laptop! I am out of the 30 day return policy otherwise I would return this asap!,0
"(Nice hardware, poor software): I was in love with this laptop before the first blue screen. After some troubleshooting, factory resetting the laptop a few times I was obligated to try something different, a full reinstall from scratch. It did work for a while them blue screens again. I have tested and stressed my laptop and I have no hardware issue. Only problem I’m facing after a full install from scratch is that predator software doesn’t launch. When I try to install it windows says that it has unsigned drivers... even after forcing the install I try to launch it but I only see the splash screen, actual software doesn’t launch. Not a big deal but can’t set the keyboard color scheme without predator sense. Besides those issues the laptop is really nice",0

"(Very slim, cool, quiet, and powerful laptop. Well worth the price.): I upgraded from an ASUS G55VW for more portability and performance. I initially did not want to purchase another ASUS as the customer service I received on my last was very shoddy. However, the specs and aesthetics of this model had me coming back. I've been in the market for a slim, light-weight, gaming laptop that was reliable and did not look like red, flaming school bus. This laptop hit the mark right on the money. It fits inside any bag and looks just like a macbook. It is a little more plasticy than a macintosh, but still feels sturdy. I like the addition of the numpad as I work with numbers and spreadsheets on a daily basis.The speakers (harman/kardon) are the best I've ever heard on a laptop. I can comfortably watch movies and YouTube videos at home without headphones. Spotify tracks also come through very clear.The laptop does not have a long battery life, but the charge time is surprisingly fast. I haven't timed it, but I'm able to plug it back in and have it fully charged without me even realizing it.I've played GTA V and Left 4 Dead 2 on highest quality so far and they both get a consistent 60 FPS without much heat. Fan noise isn't very loud, especially with the nice speakers. I'll probably update this review when I try some more demanding games out.The track pad can get a little jumpy at times, maybe for a couple minutes. I'm not sure what the cause of it is, but it's only a slight annoyance. It's pretty smooth and responsive the other 98% of the time.The screen is kind of lackluster. As others have said, the viewing angles are pretty narrow, but I honestly don't mind it too much. I've played around with MacBooks before and can say they're much better, but just about everything else on this laptop makes up for it.I'm pretty happy with my purchase, can't really suggest any changes about the laptop. After living with the last laptop for 5 years and all of its small annoyances, I'm very satisfied with the upgrade. I only recently graduated from college, but can say I would have loved to have this for taking to class or the library. Something that was very awkward and not very practical to do with the ASUS G55VW.",0

"(Great for school!): I really like the this laptop. I've had it for 4 months already and no issues yet. Great for school! It is a little heavier than other laptops, but I want a big screen and I knew that the was going to be expected. For the price, it was a no brainer.",0
(One Star): Only God to check emails and surf the Internet,0
"(Four Stars): Great, just as expected.",0
(It's great laptop but not as fast thought it would be): It's great laptop but not as fast thought it would be. Multitasking on laptop seem too much for the computer sometimes. But overall performance is great.,0
"(Screen Problems): This computer has been back to the manufacturer twice for screen issues most likely related to the cyclic fatigue of the connectors. Lenovo says that because I'm out of the return period all the can do is repeatedly fix the computer while I'm under warrantee and then be left with a brick at the end of the year. I would highly discourage anyone from buying this laptop, Lenovo knows there are issues and would rather offload their inventory than make the right decision.I though Lenovo had great quality but after interfacing with their customer service it appears I was wrong. Choose another manufacturer, it doesn't seem to be just a problem with the computer it's with their business ethics.",0

"(Total Lemon!): I purchased for my 11-yr old daughter for school. It has been nothing short of a huge mistake and I regret buying this for her. At three months, it started shutting off one automatically on a full charge. Now, she continues to get ""Chrome OS is missing or damaged."" Please insert a recovery USB stick or SD Card."" I have gone through the full recovery (total hassle) and it continues to crash and repeat itself.I strongly suggest to purchase the protection plan as HP's only offers 90-day warranty. The issues started right after 90 days...of course!I am returning to where I purchased the protection plan and hopefully, they can help me by replacing with a functioning computer.",0
(Battery life is terrible and charging is a nightmare): I was super excited about this laptop the graphics are amazing but the charging and battery life are terrible. I left it plugged in all night and still showed no battery life it has to stay plugged in... also the fan is sooo loud as soon as you start running it. wouldn't even waste your money,0
"(performance on target !): I bought this because I needed an android device to order food. I saved enough money that it paid for itself. I also needed something dependable for government business, banking, and of course playtime. The video display is stunning, so clear and crisp. Puts my laptops to shame. This tablet was worth the learning curve I endured. I'm happy with this purchase.",0
"(Worst Laptop Ever!): Extremely slow Laptop. Came really slow and got slower and slower. Can't play games on it. Streaming constantly interrupted by slow processing system. All in all piece of crap laptop, more like a very expensive paper weight.",0
"(Muy buena compra): Es muy buena opción por el tipo de procesador, los materiales no son premium pero cumplen, la laptop en color azul resulta un poco más oscuro en la vida real, pero se sigue viendo muy bonita. Me gustó mucho el producto. Llevo 2 semanas utilizando la y todo funciona correctamente. Yo la compré en $7,900.°° pero he visto bajar su precio a menos de $ 7,600.°°. Recomiendo esperar un precio así para adquirirla y valdrá aún más la pena.",0
"(Notebook is more convenient): Asus makes a good product but I prefer the Notebook over the Zenbook except I ran out of memory. Zenbook is bigger, faster, more memory, runs hotter and costs more. Why does Zenbook use a bigger SD chip that sticks out the side of the computer than the Notebook using a micro SD that remains hidden?I've had the Zenbook for 3 weeks but used it only once. I'm typing this on my Notebook because it's more convenient.",0
The battery is NOT replaceable,0
(Love it!): It serves its purpose.,0
"(Amazing Value): For a Chromebook, this is amazing. Super thin, tiny bezels, fast startup. It’s really fast. You can tell it’s having trouble when you have 6 different windows with 10 different tabs on each. But for moderate everyday function, it’s great for a sub-$200 school laptop.",0
"(Keyboard is NOT backlit): I returned this because I needed a backlit keyboard. According to the brand website, this model is supposed to have a backlit keyboard. I do not know why it arrived from the seller with different specs. I read several of the other reviews and it looks like other Amazon shoppers are getting mixed results with what item arrives.",0
"(Died after 2-3 weeks, but update, now fixed after great RMA): Laptop was working perfectly until, after two weeks, it simply died after playing a very non demanding game, kerbal space program. Temperatures were normal and the computer just randomly crashed and then could never post.In order to attempt to fix this on my own I went to take out the battery for 10 seconds. However, the battery casing is very poorly design--its placed inside the case!! Its not like the hp laptops where you can just swap it out easily by pushing a button. No, you have to remove a good 12 screws and take off the bottom panel just to remove the battery. I also sliced open my finger trying to undo all of the annoying latches without breaking the flimsy bottom panel. Oh, and by the way, it took me 10 minutes to realize that there was another screw hidden under the dumb factory seal label!!!! Very annoying and frustrating since it was very stealthily hidden. Lastly, you'll want to make sure you're very gentle when removing the case because it would be very easy to break off the little plastic latches that snap the bottom panel on.Currently put a support ticket into MSI and fortunately I'm within warranty, so I will update this depending on their responsiveness and ability to get my laptop working.So far im very disappointed, but I understand that electronics sometimes have flaws because of the laws of probability, and it may have actually been nvidia's or intel's fault, so I will revert this to 4 stars if MSI solves my problem. It would be 5 stars if the battery wasn't behind the bottom panel.UPDATE:MSI's RMA process was excellent. They did a very professional repair, it looks brand new and runs well. I was worried that they might mess up the thermal paste after putting in a new mobo, but it appears. Apparently there was a crack in the chassis that I did not even know about and they replaced and fixed it to without me even mentioning it! They've done right by me and I am impressed. I would give this 5 stars, but its not quite perfect due to the fact that the battery is on the inside and you have to remove 12 screws to get to hit. Besides that however this is an excellent product. I'll update if this dies again but MSI RMA service was fast and beyond expectation. Including shipping, receiving, them having to get new parts, and them fix it, it only took 2 weeks, and they rushed it so that I could get it before my trip. You won't be dissatisfied with the RMA service if you need it, so you can probably trust that MSI will do right by you. Thumbs up MSI. Killer deal for 899.",0
"(Great laptop - watch out for dead pixels): Received this product yesterday, it's a GREAT laptop for the price, funs all games I've thrown at it at max settings and doesn't overheat. Speakers are kind of ""meh"" but I hook up a pair of external ones anyway. My one complaint is the laptop I received has the tiniest sliver of dead pixels at the bottom of the screen right along the bezzle (only maybe a 1/2 inch in length). It's not noticeable unless whatever's on the screen is black.other than that I can't recommend this laptop enough!",0
"(My husband love it!): I bought this laptop for my husband for his 65th birthday. His laptop was 11 years old and was on it’s last leg. He was afraid to buy a new laptop because he thought things had become too techy in the past 11 years but this one is perfect! The screen is crystal clear and the keys are large enough for his big bulky fingers. He plays word games and does puzzles, explores websites, he emails,,spends time on Facebook, checks out his sports, neighborhood stuff, etc… and if he wants to explore more, he can. It’s super fast and stays connected to our wifi with ease.It’s perfect and the price was SO right!! Oh, I also purchased the insurance plan just in case. That too is a great deal and great idea, in my opinion!5 Stars!",0

My son loves it since he uses an X box for gaming and his phone for most other things... this fits the bill for that in-between technology that he was missing - a place to type up things (office business/school), emails, web-browsing, and applications that are familiar to someone that uses a Samsung S10 phone (Android). The OS is Android so remember that... not Windows (for the novice techie). Samsung as a real winner here.",0

(This is a quality laptop with a beautiful backlit keyboard and bright display.): I purchased this computer through BarKay Computers. The first one had problems. BarKay handled the return at no cost and sent a replacement that works perfectly! Rarely do I have the pleasure purchasing from a supplier that is so helpful especially when unforeseen issues arise.,0
"(Laptop has serious flaws.): On paper, it looks like a great laptop, and games do run as you would expect them to. But there are numerous issues that ruin the experience. First, and foremost, there is sleep. Dell has completely disabled it in favor of connected standby. So unless you shut your computer down, you are likely to pull the laptop out of your bag with a dead battery and the entire thing hot to the touch. This is unacceptable for a portable device. Additionally, battery life is mediocre, even for a gaming laptop, and the thermals are poorly designed. Even just browsing the web will leave this laptop too hot to sit in your laptop. And during gaming sessions, the fans will blow hot air right over your hands making the experience uncomfortable. Frankly there are are too many better options at this price point. I would suggest looking at those.",0
"(Would not buy again): I was hoping to get a good Chromebook, my Toshiba screen went bad after 3 years. Now I wish I would have paid more and gotten something better. This Samsung is slow to load, slow to type on, locks up so you have to wait until it catches up to continue what you were doing. I am really disappointed. I have tested it with fast and slow internet speeds, several tabs open and just one, makes no difference. I would NOT buy again. I really miss the Toshiba, quick and slick and backlit keys as well.

Will be nice if you can charge with USB-C to allow for smaller charger when traveling.Very happy with purchase and highly recommended.Disclaimer, I am receiving a 90 day warranty extension for my feedback.",0

"(A beast of a gaming laptop at a budget price): This review is for the following laptop (since there are a few variants on this listing): ""Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-54-760S Gaming Laptop | Intel i7-11800H | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU | 15.6"" Full HD 144Hz 3ms IPS Display | 16GB DDR4 | 512GB SSD | Killer WiFi 6 | RGB Keyboard""I am a lifelong gamer, and a few years ago I picked up a Dell gaming laptop that was in about the same price range as this one. That laptop was a disappointment for me and just immediately made me wish I had something better, so I ended up getting a top of the line desktop to replace it. I say this because I've had a gaming laptop void in my life, and was a little bit skeptical of laptops in this price range, but was still interested to give this one a whirl.At first I was a little worried. The shipping box was partially crushed. Fortunately, Acer did a really spectacular job with the laptop packaging. Inside the shipping box is another relatively plain brown box, which looks like nothing special. Opening that, and you see a black box for the laptop, and, to my surprise, a neoprene style laptop sleeve for this laptop. Inside the black box is ANOTHER black box, very well packed, with the laptop inside of a fabric bag. I know the unboxing experience is not really all that critical, but I must say, I was very pleased and impressed with how this was all packed. If this were being gifted to someone, I'd probably open the brown box and wrap up the Predator branded black box that comes inside, and wrap the sleeve separately.The sleeve it comes with has a zipper on it, and an Acer predator logo on one corner. It's a basic sleeve, a nice touch that it's included, but I will admit I have a bit of a phobia of these kind of sleeves, worrying that the zipper will scratch the laptop on the way in or out of the sleeve. I have been using it though, and so far so good.After removing the laptop from the fabric bag it comes packed in, I was a little surprised at a few things. I typically expect a gaming laptop (especially ""budget"" ones) to be thick, bulky, oversized, heavy... and this one is none of those things. It's by no means compact or light, but it's just overall slimmer, thinner, and lighter than I anticipated. I was also really surprised at the finish. The back side of the screen, and the inside of the laptop by the keyboard is all metal and just looks and feels very nice. The budget Dell gaming laptop I have is thicker, heavier, and all plastic, so this was just a pleasant surprise.Powering the laptop on, there's a loud airplane taking off sound (not the fans) that plays during bootup. I haven't figured out how to turn that off. Windows 10 setup was simple, the only thing notable was during the setup I was prompted to create an Acer ID and register the device, and there was no way to bypass or skip it. The text on the screen actually referenced being able to skip it, but I couldn't see any way to actually do that, so I had to provide a name and email to give to Acer to get in to Windows for the first time, which I wasn't crazy about.After setup, I had about 429gb of free space on my first boot into Windows. Another thing that surprised me was that there wasn't an overwhelming amount of extra stuff installed. The extra stuff that I noticed was:- Dropbox Promotion- Firefox with Amazon Assistant Plugin (also noticed Firefox had a ""Allow firefox to install and run studies"" option turned on)- Facebook Messenger- ExpressVPN- Norton Security Ultra- PhotoDirector- PowerDirector- Alexa- ""Planet9 Link""Some may find those items beneficial, I tend to prefer a clean slate and put on the things that I choose. There's also a couple of items like ""PredatorSense"" which launches from a dedicated button on the keyboard - it's Acer's software to control RGB lighting, fans, monitor temperatures, etc, and I find it useful.I've been very pleased with this as far as performance goes. It's very snappy. Gaming performance has been fantastic. The RTX 3060 graphics is great. I've been playing several modern games at ultra settings, and they seem to play quite well. I'm honestly pretty surprised... and liking this a lot more than I thought I would. I've got a top of the line desktop in the other room, but I just find it super comfortable to lay on the couch and play on a laptop with a gamepad. While playing graphics intensive games the fans haven't gotten too loud, unless I press the ""turbo"" button on the laptop to ramp them up all the way.I also quite like the low profile keys on the keyboard, and the backlight/rgb lights for them. You can adjust the brightness, and set 4 lighting zones in the included PredatorSense app.If I have anything critical to say, I guess the speakers don't get that loud. It's fine if that's the only noise in the room, but if you've got a loud A/C or fans or refrigerator or other ambient noise, it may not get loud enough with the built in speakers. Aside from that, I really haven't got anything bad to say at all.So in summary, the following things impressed me:- The above average unboxing experience- Comes with a halfway decent neoprene zippered sleeve- All metal casing- Size/weight - not as bulky as expected, fairly slim and light given what it is- Not an overwhelming amount of extra stuff installed- Fantastic gaming performance, graphics at ultra settings- Fans aren't that loud unless you turn on Turbo mode- Fantastic keyboard with backlit keys, customizable lighting via the PredatorSense appI feel like this bats above its price range and impressed me in several ways, so I am very happy to give a 5 star rating, and will be a repeat customer from Acer in the future based on my experience with this comparing to a Dell gaming laptop that I have had in the past.",0

"(EXCELLENT FIRST STEP INTO THE PC GAMING SPACE): I received this laptop as a gift in 2017, and for the past 5 years it has only exceeded expectations relative to the price. I mostly play fps titles such as siege and Overwatch, both of which run smoothly. Using a bit of DIY skills the useful lifespan of this laptop can be extended by years. About 2 years in I added RAM, 4 years in a repasted the chips and all thermal throttling went away. Recently, I built a new PC in order to have hardware with a clear upgrade path, but my laptop is still perfectly acceptable for running every game I am interested in five years later (with a few minor upgrades/repairs. ). The only con is the battery life, but that was never an issue for me as almost all public spaces in 2022 have easy access to outlets.",0
"(Fantastic Computer): This is the first time I've spent more than $800 on a PC. No regrets. It's a gorgeous machine that can run every game I've thrown at it with top quality graphics.The only cons are battery life - usually around 2 hours unplugged - and very loud fans. Neither of these are an issue for me, as I usually use headphones and I use a tablet when I'm travelling. As a PC replacement, this is a great computer.",0
"(Quit working): This is exactly what I wanted! After the set-up, I closed the top to check out the many ports on the sides. Opened the top again to start trying out my new laptop, and the screen didn't come back on. Tried everything! Even hooked it up to my tv via HDMI. The screen never came back on, but I could see everything on my tv screen. Had to return. Bought October 22. It is now November29th, and I still have no refund or computer. And I can't buy another until I get my money back!! Yes they have the computer and yes, I have called and was told in 2-3 days. That was the week before Thanksgiving. I have never had this happen on an Amazon purchase before. So unhappy make it zero stars!",0
"(Buen equipo): Todo bien hasta que revisé y tenia 2 ram de 3000 de 4 gb cada una ,pero trabajando a 2660 mhz se suponía que era una sola ram de 8 y quedaba un slot para el upgrade...",0
(... still getting used to it but so for so good. I was surprised to see that the color ...): I'm still getting used to it but so for so good. I was surprised to see that the color of this unit is not the soft gold/champagne I see in the pictures but a warm silver. I was upset at first but I actually like it better. Update to follow.,0
"(Great): Really nice screen even in this 1080p, very good, a little longer battery would be better , and a bit pricey though",0
(Five Stars): One word...(Amazing),0
"(An excellent buy!): I've been into gaming for a while and was looking at purchasing a gaming laptop. I came across this deal and was absolutely blown away at the price for what you are getting with this machine, and yes I mean MACHINE. This laptop has handled everything I have thrown at it on high to max settings.The build quality is nice, not too heavy but still feels solid. The keyboard is great and has different RGB settings that you can play around with if that's your thing. The trackpad is also surprisingly good, not like other trackpads that just feels ""cheap."" Being able to control the different fan speeds is a nice addition as well.I do not have anything bad to say really about this laptop. The only thing I can see being a problem for someone is the USB port placement on the laptop, two being located at the right corner on the front of the laptop. This may cause some inconvenience for right-handed mouse users.In conclusion, I highly recommend this laptop if and when it does become available again on Amazon (at the time of this review it was sold out). You probably will not find a better deal like this one for a while and I am glad I made the purchase.",0
"(Disaster of a product): After 4 months the screen stopped working. Amazon told me over and again to reboot, despite me telling them what the problem is.They then passed me to Acer, who told me that somehow the screen is not covered by the warrantee, and that I was free to spend $154 to fix their junky $200 computer.I strongly advise not to buy this unless you want to be very frustrated and out $200.",0
(DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!): This seller is a scumbag. Computer was freezing over and over while I was trying to set it up. I knew something wasn’t right. I wasted over TWO HOURS trying to get this thing setup. I call dell support and sure enough this laptop is NOT NEW. It was purchased from Best Buy originally over 245 days ago. Even after a google “powerwash” whatever the $@&! lame excuse that is for a reset the laptop was STILL crashing. Screw you Happy Ranger/Oceanus. Buy new tech in a store where you can clearly see it’s new.,0
"(Box corner crushed): Ordered this as a Christmas present, when I received it the corner of the laptops box was crushed.",0
"(Great): Backlit keys, beautiful screen, Robocop shell, long battery life.I absolutely love the XPS line. I have the 17, and it's a monster workhorse. It's the only laptop I have that can compare to my desktop. I wanted something a little smaller to easily carry around, and where battery life wasn't a concern. This was the obvious choice.I'm using the Windows 11 version, and I'm very happy to report that it doesn't feel like a big leap from Windows 10. Almost everything on it is an intuitive transition. The only thing that was weird for me was the centralized taskbar, but I found that there's a setting to put it back on the bottom left like I like, so I'm happy.The screen is as sharp and bright as I've come to expect from the XPS line. It's absolutely beautiful, and it makes watching YouTube feel like a clean experience. I really like the 16x10 aspect ratio as that extra space makes doing work and browsing web pages so much easier.It uses WiFi6, and it automatically detected it from my router, so I'm running full WiFi 6 with no effort on my part. Pages open immediately, and everything feels very responsive. It feels like a solid Ethernet connection.I used Crystal Disk Mark and I'm getting around 3 Gigs for both read and write. The hard drive is definitely no bottleneck.It upgraded the laptop bios without me having to do anything special. That's really cool to me because low level security problems need to be taken care of, and most people can't do it. This literally did everything for me just by hitting Windows Update and then restarting the computer. In my opinion that makes this one of the best laptops for people that don't want to have to think about it.I have to talk about the case. It's such a heavy duty feeling laptop just because of the thick aluminum case. Anyone that picks it up is surprised by the rock solid feeling on it.The keys on it feel like a luxurious soft material that my fingers love touching. It's a beautiful typing experience. It's a 13"", so there's no numpad, but the keys aren't crunched together. I have big hands, so that's a big deal for me, and typing on this feels very natural.The touchpad is just like my 17 in that it's the best touchpad on the market today. It's responsive, it registers exactly like I expect, it clicks when I press it, and it makes for a normal feeling experience. These are the only types of touchpads that don't frustrate me into grabbing an external mouse.I tried Far Cry 6 on it just to see how it could handle gaming. I was getting artifacts, but I chalked that up to new game, new computer, new operating system. I expect a patch soon for it. I tried my favorite Far Cry title, Far Cry 4, and I could run that at 720 with 50 fps, or 1080 with 30 fps.Overall this is a beautiful premium laptop that's fully capable of taking on my work.Highly recommended.",0
"(I love): Needless to say, I love my Macbook Air. This is the first time I purchased a laptop that's apple. I have owned one in the past, but it felt good actually purchasing my own this time. Now I not only have an Ipad, Apple Watch, Apple phone but I now have an Apple Macbook Air.",0

"(Nice choice for an Acer): You have many options to choose, you have to admit that. But this Acer is doing pretty good among all. 11th Generation Intel Core i3-1115G4 processor delivers unmatched speed and intelligence, enabling impressive creating, productivity, and gaming experiences. 15.6"" Full HD display with 82.58% screen-to-body, 16:9 aspect ratio and narrow bezels is good enough for daily uses. Do not rely on this PC for high performance resolution. Battery is as good as any HP or Lenovo. Almost two hours light usage is not bad if you just do some basic work.",0
"(Not a touchscreen): Didn't notice that it wasn't a touchscreen. Returned it. Actually said in the details ""non touchscreen"" so when I searched for touchscreen Chromebook, it came up in the results.",0

"(This computer will oftentimes freeze on startup): I went to the Acer Helios website to see if it was just me, and it sure isn't. This computer freezes a LOT during bootup. I bought it brand new and for whatever reason, 1 out of every 2 times that I try to power it on, it'll just freeze on the boot up screen forcing me to do a hard reset.Nobody on their website has managed to fix this issue when you comb thru the threads. I recommend staying clear of this one.",0
the keyboard doesn't lock on one side of the tablet,0
(Battery is trash): Good laptop for the most part but the battery is absolutely horrible. You get a short time before it’s already telling you to recharge.,0
"The wireless charging option available for certain models of this device is quite revolutionary. It's a game-changer for me as it has completely eliminated the need for wires, making charging a breeze.",1

(I love these Chromebooks.): I wish they were a little cheaper. I'm going to buy another soon.,0
"(Faulty charging system): On the second day of use it started problematic charging. When charger was plugged in it kept charging for 5 minutes and then automatically stopped charging. It started charging again after unplugging and plugging again, but only for 5 more minutes. The laptop kept doing over and over again, just wont fully charge. Just didn't seem to be a trait of a brand new laptop. Wont recommend this seller.",0
"(Not worth it.): My aunt bought the same laptop and it worked perfectly for her, so she recommended it to me as well. So, I went and bought it, sadly it came in the day after my graduation. I was very much look forward to using it for class work instead of my old slow computer I’ve had for years. Once this laptop came in I was very excited to try it out that night, so I went through the set up process, with my aunt’s help of course, seeing as how she already set up hers. Once finished the set up process, I wanted to just play on my brand new laptop. So, I got onto candy crush with it, because the game was already on it, and I downloaded Spotify. It worked perfect for the 30 minutes I was on, but it was late and I was tired, so I went to sleep. The next morning I wake up early and go to get on the laptop. I go and type in my password, and it goes to log me in, then I go to use it to look up a few things, and set up a few things on it. The web browser doesn’t show up, so I click it again, wait a minute, click again, and then waited. Almost half an hour passed until it popped up, but by then I had already clicked whatever else was on the screen, just hoping it would work. After this I shut it down, and I must have tried it 30 more times until finally getting tired of it freezing and so many different times.",0
"(Arrived dead on arrival): Bought this for my kid but laptop arrived dead on arrival and we returned it. He bought a laptop directly from Dell instead, works like a charm.",0
(Wireless issue): Not sure about everything else but the wireless connection was not stable. Returned the laptop the day after receiving it.,0
(Troublesome): Never had so much irritation setting up a computer. The robot tells me that my entered phone number isn’t my phone number.,0
"(Brand new laptop, felt like this is ""the one""): I primarily needed a new laptop that could handle a little bit of MMORPG gaming and photo editing. Really, photo editing was the main thing I needed. Definitely take your time to research what laptop to get first before proceeding to buy what may feel will be the right piece of technology for you. I knew ASUS and Lenovo have some good equipment so I looked into ASUS primarily. 8GB of RAM is recommended really to get the job done with most things. This laptop that I just ordered has 256GB of SSD (Solid State Drive), which definitely helps out when it comes to photo editing for me or even just doing general work (email, research, social media links, etc). Honestly, I'm really content with how my laptop came to be.The box was well-sealed. Laptop looked brand-spanking new to my eyes. It felt light-ish. However, when first started it up, it did run the drive pretty harsh but I think that was just the necessary initial start-up to get the laptop running. Other than that, it's been a whole day since I've had the laptop and it really fits all the things I needed to do with it.The keyboard has backlight, which I didn't read that but found out through working with the laptop. The battery life really says what it lasts for: 8 hours or so. I'm not iffy when it comes to a keyboard, but this one felt right to me. Different keyboards will come with adjustment absolutely. One thing different from my last laptop was a number keypad to my right; that will take some time to adjust without having access to that. The sound projection isn't terrible, but it is way better than my previous laptop. I bought the laptop without any Microsoft software, however, it provides a trial for the software but I'll be switching around laptops for certain things for myself. I definitely see great duration for this beauty and will keep this updated if remembered.",0
"(Excellent laptop): Nice laptop, very powerful",0
"(Excited at first but that quickly changed!): Not great for streaming, ok for internet browsing. Only had this for about a month and it's freezing up quite a bit. Ctrl Alt delete doesn't seem to work well at all.",0
(Good for YouTube. Not for work. Would NOT recommend for development.): I use this every day for full-stack development using Cloud9. Can't share screen and use pen at the same time (it glitches out). Hangouts drops. Discord drops. 5.1 audio doesn't play correctly as the front and rear channels are swapped and no way to fix it. Wouldn't recommend for development,0
"(Great battery life, cheap casing): Considering what I paid, I guess I should feel happier about it.It has great battery life and charges really quickly a well. However, the case has that cheap plastic feel to it. On top of which, any pressure on the surface near the track pad translates to the processor as actual track pad activity, which means that occasionally the Chromebook acts like a possessed machine, jumping screens, opening and closing tabs, etc.Good for what I use it for, but nothing to write home about.",0
"(Great Laptop for Work and Fun): I’ve been very happy with this MacBook and it’s integration with my my iPhone, iPad and Mac accessories. It’s light weight but feels substantial with the aluminum frame and the keyboard is crisp and responsive for a compact laptop.",0
(Esta muy bien): Más colores y más en Capacidad y más en RAM y vplumen,0
it is backlit which is a very nice touch,0
"(ok so far.): reevaluation ... after some reconsideration and a hard wire mouse this is now working perfectly .. Now im 100% into this device . However i did have to update the system when it wouldn't ""Cast"" YouTube to my smart tv but after doing that im as pleased as can be. It picks up my w-fi signal much better than my last chromebook. no delays whatsoever watching hi-def YouTube videos .",0
(Recommend): Just started college and needed a laptop. I love this!,0
the battery is defective as usual,0
"(Overall happy with this (XPS 15/9500) so far!): I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this is a big ticket item for most people.I have nothing bad to say regarding the particular XPS 9500 unit I received with a couple of caveats...The Bad:Similar to other reviewers, I suspect this product is not ""NEW"" as described but rather returned and/or refurbished. It came in a rather torn up box which was simply sealed with regular packing tape. It was shipped to Amazon from a company that appears to be an authorized reseller/or refurbishing center as far as I could tell from a quick Google search. The box had certainly been around the block a time or two, LOL.Given the price point and specs, I'm not surprised if it is a ""refurb, open box, return, etc."" I'm only surprised that Amazon sells them at a steep discount but describes as ""NEW"". I could be way off base here, and perhaps Dell ships most of their products in beat up boxes, and I'm just unaware of it.The Good:I know the above sounded very critical, but bear with me. Once I opened the outer box, the inner Dell box was pristine. Everything was nicely packaged and appeared brand new. The usual protective plastic peel off, unwrap, etc. stuff was all there on everything. There wasn't a fingerprint or speck of dust to be found. Even smelled ""like new"". So...I figured I'd give it a go. Set it up and everything seemed fine, so I opened it up and upgraded memory to 64gb. Everything internally looked new to my untrained eye as well. I've been using it for several days with no issues. Overall, I personally am happy for the price, but if these aren't truly ""new"", I think description should reflect that.Considerations:My laptop before this one was an XPS 15 2012 or 2013 model. It originally had Windows 8 on it FWIW. I had upgraded to SSD, switched to Win10, maxed out RAM, and replaced battery over the years...Just so you know my basis for comparison.Other reviews on both Amazon and online mention crackling speakers and faulty trackpads with this model. My experience has been that speakers sound as good as any laptop I've ever heard, and trackpad is slightly less sensitive in top corners but otherwise fine (I never would have noticed trackpad thing except for online reviews had me looking for faults.) I personally find the speakers and trackpad perfectly fine. Another criticism has been loud fan noise when laptop is trying to cool. It doesn't bother me because my old XPS sounds like a turbo spooling up when it's under a load too! Maybe other brands are quieter, IDK. Fan noise wasn't a big concern of mine.Perhaps mine was a return/refurb that had faults addressed, I just got lucky and got a good unit, or the faults aren't as bad as they are made out to be with this model. I can't say for certain, but that's my experience thus far and honest review.",0
"Thermals are great, GPU never exceeded 71c at 100% usage, no throttling that i was aware of.",0
I don't think anything like video or photo editing or machine learning should be attempted on this.,0
(Superior Quality): Thoroughly impressed with the quality and features of this product!!,0
"(Great laptop for the price): Bought this laptop and a 32gb ( 16 x 2 ) memory kit. Installed Solus Linux and I could not be happier.Love the keyboard and the overall profile of this laptop. It's not heavy and is very thin for a 15.6"" laptop. It does have a budget NMVe m.2 drive, so I will upgrade that at some point for some additional, faster storage.Linux runs great on this laptop. All of the function keys work ( screen brightness, volume, etc ). An AMD Ryzen 7 quad-core with 8-threads and 32gb is quite a bit of resources for Linux. Time to install Docker and get to work !!!",0

(It works great): Nothing to not to like,0

"(Great laptop for me!): I don't do a lot of gaming, but it's great for Microsoft 365, email and shopping. The only issue I have is how light the words on the keyboard are. Until I learned where the 'end' key was, for instance, I struggled to see it. Still it's a great lightweight unit and I am very happy with it.",0

"(Buy this laptop! You won’t be disappointed.): I love this little computer! When I was looking for a laptop to buy, I almost went with a used, older MacBook Air. I decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and I’m so happy I did because Apple’s M1 chip is impressive. After two months of owning this laptop, I think my favorite thing is the battery life. For lighter tasks (web browsing, listening to music, steaming Netflix etc), the battery could last the entire day, and I love how I can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well. For heavier tasks, it of course doesn’t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery. It rarely gets hot, and doesn’t even have a fan, so you know how efficient that chip is running. I also love the fanless design because I can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans. I don’t use it for anything crazy, mainly just work and personal stuff, along with frequent streaming and occasionally I’ll fire up the Sims 4 (and it runs beautifully by the way). But I’m never not impressed by how quick it is, opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly. Also, I am new to Mac with this purchase but have owned iPhones for a decade and I love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone. So far I’m loving Big Sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone.",0
"(Don't waste your money.): This is a cheap refurbished piece of trash. The skimped on some basic refurbishing, and the thing barely works and is slow. I got this computer because it was the same model as my work computer, and I was sorely let down. The mouse pad area is clearly worn and had a cheap sticker over it, the camera doesn't work for trash, and the whole thing is clearly much older than the advert leads one to believe. I am generally a fan of refurbished products because there is an inherent understanding that the product was used but made to be like new using new parts, and this computer failed spectacularly...",0
(Perfect for schooling from home): My kids needed these for schooling from home during the pandemic. Set up was a breeze and shipping was super fast. Highly recommend this product and this seller. A+++,0
"(The computer is fine the way it is): The computer is fine the way it is. The battery life is ridiculous though. Sometimes, my laptop only lasts for like 2 1/2 hours and I'm not even doing any type of gaming. Just normal stuff. Quite honestly, I regret getting it. You are literally paying a little over $900 for a computer that will die on you. I also hate that it gets dirty easily. For example, the smudges on the keyboard. The design on the mouse pad thing could have been better as well. They should have added a button or something where you can disable the mouse pad, that way it's not randomly clicking while you are typing something on the keyboard.The performance is great. I just wish that it had better design and the battery didn't die so quickly. Of course, if you want a better layout, you have to spend a little more money but tbh, again.. there are other designs out there for the same out of price or less that has the same specs and performance as this. You are literally paying for the name ""MSI:.",0
(Complete Trash): Lasted two weeks before it presented with a blue screen error that said Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC.

"(Works well): This product is to replace an aging/old laptop. New one is easy to configure, works well and faster.",0
"(Perfect all-in-one notebook!): I needed a new laptop for school, but I also wanted something powerful enough for some casual gaming here and there and maybe some video editing down the line. This notebook is able to do both of those! And it's light enough that I don't feel weighed down when it's in my school bag. I'm not a fan of the red keyboard, but it's no deal breaker. I upgraded to a Samsung 1tb nvme SSD and added 8gb more ram for 16 total. This thing is officially a little powerhouse! MSI customer support is also amazing, they answer the phone right away and are very knowledgeable about all of their products. There's tons and tons of information about their products on their website and youtube page. Thanks to that, upgrading this notebook was easy for me (who's otherwise not super knowledgeable about computers). Money well spent!",0

When I decided to repaste with liquid metal, I saw the poor application of paste from the factory (see pic). No wonder this laptop was running so hot. After the liquid metal I was able to overclock the GPU to over 1700 MHz and even still this puppy never gets past 80C for either gpu or cpu during heavy loads. However for the premium price you pay for this thing, it shouldn't be necessary for me to fix it.",0

"(Just Everything): This is generation 6, generation 7 is now out, but speaking of generation 6. It has everything you could want in a business laptop, ports, a mini memory card, excellent screen, bluetooth, Hello fingerprint and face recognition, etc. This is my 3rd Thinkpad, along with other laptops, and I won't be going back to any others, if I ever need another one I'll be going directly to Lenovo or one of their dealers.",0
I called MSI technical support (not amazon) and they gave me steps to get it to work. Which were basically what I had done on my own,0
(Seller was helpful in returning item): Just after turning the device one it started glitching and flickering. We sent it back right away!,0
(College laptop): Works great for college. solid state hard drive is great and boots up fast.,0
Most navigational keys are placed in strange places.,0
"(Great value for a student laptop): So far so good! I bought 2 of these chrome books for my teenage daughters for Christmas and they are a huge hit. If they hold up and perform thus well for the next ~18 months, they will be well worth the low price.",0
"(Battery life): I've owned the MacBook for almost a month, and everything is working perfectly with the exception of one issue. The battery?life?is awful. I use it for 30 minutes, and it uses up half of my battery. It drains as well when it's not even on, I can close it at around 50% and then open it again a few hours later, and it will be on low battery. Furthermore, the MacBook Pro I previously owned could go around 2 days on a full charge. So Just keep that in mind if you decide to purchase this pricey Mac.",0
"The build of the MSI screen was disappointingly flimsy and I feel that I could one day break this thing if I opened the screen the wrong way, especially with one hand.",0
"(I absolutely love it!): I've own 3 Dell laptops and would never have thought to buy another brand, however the day that I was due to purchase a new Dell, this Acer flashed up on my 'Amazon Treasure Truck' deals and I believed it was a sign. I'm so happy I bought it! A great deal! A great laptop! and boy am I happy! The only 'con' is it's not touchscreen but the 'pros' out balance this and are also too numerous to mention!!",0
"(An okay deal, needs upgrades in my opinion): At the time I purchased this, it was a good deal, and I won't change my star rating. However, if you are purchasing a laptop today, compare this to ones of newer hardware makes and you'll find even other ASUS products like the TUF line in a very similar price bracket with better hardware. I do have it on some authority that even these other products, and those produced by some other companies, still ship in single channel mode so plan accordingly if you want to really get the bang for the buck you're looking for. I will update again when upgrades are complete.My intention in buying this laptop was to get a steep upgrade over my ancient ASUS SonicMaster, but without breaking $2000. I have had it little more over a week, and all seems good. Graphics are excellent, battery is understandably not great and in every setting capacity still LOSES charge while plugged in and gaming, but I've had much worse. (See updates). I have found that turning off hardware acceleration for many programs actually lends itself to better overall performance, especially given that few programs even NEED this feature to operate efficiently. I also saw a reduction in temperatures by simply raising the rear of the base by even just a few millimeters to allow space for air beneath the laptop. The form factor works against you more than other more airflow oriented cases.UPDATE: The included bloatware is irritating, as with any company. Armoury Crate, an in-your-face advertisement that also KIND OF controls the RGB (though the lights completely blanking out or features not working at all is common), though can be borderline worthless unless you install the separate but functionally similar Aura Sync program (which often conflicts with Armoury Crate it seems). Not only is Armoury Crate just another way to slip ads into your general computer experience, there are at least 3 other apps that serve to also do that, all from ASUS, which is disappointing from a company I've always loved and supported. RGB lighting is irritatingly dim and brightness settings are not readily easy to find, but it hardly matters as Armoury Crate and Aura Sync seem to occasionally randomly disable the RGB anyway with my settings disappearing. So don't buy ASUS on the promise of RGB.The camera, though decent enough, is planted just above your F12 key, meaning to actually have it look at your face, you will need to bend the monitor back 30-45 degrees away from you. Ridiculous, for a feature that even the cheapest, worst laptops get right. I don't use laptop cameras very often, but this is absolutely stupid placement. Otherwise, at typical viewing angle, the camera is half-full of your F12 key. On the plus side at least the RGB is nice on camera when it works.UPDATE 2: I have made particular note of the fact that this laptop SHIPS with only one RAM stick. This means that you will operate in the functionally inferior single-channel mode, which for a top-down quality product maker like ASUS is frankly bothersome. If you're getting this for gaming, you only really need 16gb. I still have games that top out at 8gb usage. But, to get this machine to actually operate at its capacity, the smart thing to do is buy a whole other 16gb RAM stick, or sell the included stick and buy 2x8gb sticks if gaming is all you're doing and you don't wanna spend enough to buy a lower quality laptop just in upgrading this one. I know this might sound like you end up with the same amount of RAM but computers perform better with dual-channel (2 sticks), demonstrably so, though I've yet to see the impact on this computer as of now I'm still waiting for the new stick to arrive.On that same note, I am personally replacing the m.2 drive for a faster, higher capacity Samsung model. On inspection, this computer has fantastic expansion capabilities, but the cooling still concerns me. On initial setup with the stock SSD, I attempted to move my Windows file directories like Pictures, Documents, Music, etc. to the larger HDD which is my normal method to save SSD space and put bulk storage on the HDD, and I encountered strange complications where the directory wouldn't change and duplicate directories appeared elsewhere. I've not yet discovered how or why this occurred. I believe it's a Windows issue, however I've never experienced this on any other machine of any other configuration.BIOS is another point of contention for me, as I've yet to find the standard settings I usually see in other ASUS products. Either they've been hidden, moved, or entirely removed. I'm referring to settings for the processor and RAM specifically. It did, however, ship with the latest BIOS revision and since owning it I have not seen another update to the BIOS posted in the manufacturer website. Granted they probably don't want people trying to overclock this machine, but if these settings truly are gone it also makes undervolting and RAM management harder.The touchpad is functional, but I hate touchpads so I don't have a lot to say. Nicer than most. The display panel is alright, though color balance always feels off somewhat. The keyboard is a little awkward for me to adjust to, however the keys are very responsive and the frame is very sturdy, meaning no flex in the keyboard with pressure applied. A+ keyboard.",0
"(La laptop tiene un bonito dise?o): La laptop es muy bonita, pero la desventaja que le vi es que no se si no leí bien las especificaciones pero el teclado está en inglés por lo que usamos un controlador para ponerlo en espa?ol, la situación es que obviamente el teclado está diferente a cómo se usa en mexico por lo demás la computadora funciona muy bien solo hay que acostumbrarse al teclado, el procesador rápido y por el momento no he tenido mayor problema",0
"(The keyboard is gone.): After used one year, the keyboard is gone. ""D"" key does not work at all.",0
(great): love it,0
"(Lightweight, yet fast and powerful): Powerful laptop that can handle music production and djing softwares without problems. This computer is so light and thin that it is unbelievable how well it works.There is no need to buy a Macbook Pro M1. Shop this one without hesitation.",0
"(Powerful laptop for the price.): At the time I bought this, this was by far the best bang for buck laptop I could fine. It's main use is to act as host for live music recording and it's processing is excellent for the job. It does well enough with a latency monitor test. It gets used in a studio environment fairly regularly as well, but I wouldn't track with it in the same room as the fans can get loud enough to become bothersome. Under normal usage it is isn't an issue. I want to upgrade the amount of memory at some stage, but I loaded a big project with over 50 tracks and 311 plugins and memory wasn't an issue, so for now it is fine. A bigger SSD will be necessary in the near future though. The GPU is powerful enough for my needs gaming needs, albeit this is not why I bought it. Even though this wasn't designed as a content creator laptop the screen is quit good and I've edited a few videos and photos on it as well. I just wish it had an SD card reader. The battery life isn't seen as excellent these days but for my standards it has seen me through an audit and is big enough for my needs.",0
(Does not want to connect to the Wi-Fi): No option to connect to the internet/Wi-Fi,0
"(Laptop super SLOW, then crashed!!!!): I was very much enthusiastic about my laptop. It worked well for a short bit but then it started to move extremely slow... Taking forever to load up. Storage isn't as advertised because I have no more than 30 videos downloaded and it's behaving as if it's out of storage.After a couple months, I used it one morning and shut down, then went back to the laptop within a hour or so after shutting down to proceed with what I was doing earlier, but the laptop started up to the point for me to put in my password and then froze at that point and wasn't responding to the cursor or any of the keys touched. After turning it off and then back on, I got a message that booting device cannot be found, among others (See images)... And it isn't responding to any of the actions tried in restoring. That's how it has been since.",0
(Good computer): Good value... works very well,0
"(A great laptop for daily use): I don't use laptops very frequently; for some reason, I just can't seem to put my phone or iPad down to grab my laptop. It's not necessarily because laptops aren't great, I'm just lazy. I recently gave my wife my MacBook Air because I just didn't use it much, but seeing this Acer with the EVO i7 badge and 8 GB of ram was too hard to pass up, as it was what I was looking for when I ultimately decided on the unneeded 16GB ram MacBook Air: the 8GB of ram is MORE than enough for my daily tasks, and is typically good for random gaming (take the horror game Visage: it requires 6, prefers 8, so this is right in the wheelhouse).The laptop feels efficient, programs open really quick, the keyboard is highly responsive and, though there's a bit of a click, it's the perfect amount for someone that doesn't like those loud programming keyboards but also doesn't like those whisper quiet ones that some tablets come with.The appearance is basic on the outside but sharp on the inside; the white/silver keyboard is just plain nice to look at, and having white as the backlight color is especially nice at night.As for the battery, that's an easy 5* for me. I constantly put my computer in sleep and come back like 24-48 hours later. Doing that repeatedly for a week, I still opened this thing up to have over 2.5 hours of battery life left. I had this computer for at least 2 weeks and have plugged it in literally ONE time, at the very beginning. Wow. I'm still at 2hr and 3min battery left, and that's 22%.Overall, I don't know if someone that uses and abuses their laptops, like I used to in College, will gravitate towards this Acer, because I'm not terribly familiar with what they're looking for. If you're a developer, you probably need double the ram. If you're a hardcore gamer, you'll probably need double the ram AND a better graphics card.BUT:If you're a fairly regular laptop user who likes lightweight units, doesn't need a touch screen, still likes multiple USB ports, and likes a hefty battery life, along with half a TB of space, sure, you might find something cheaper if you research, but from my recent experience with no research into comparable units, and just the testing I've had with this, I would recommend the Acer for sure. As someone who bought a MacBook Air with the M1 Chip and 16GB of ram, but just didn't use it that frequently, this Acer has more than taken it's place. I didn't need that much ram. This one does everything I need.",0
(Great for home use): It’s perfect for home use . Great picture and battery life,0
(great for value): this laptop is great for its value. I bought a preowned one from shop America and it came in earlier than expected. laptop did not have any scratch marks. no signs of wear and tear. it looked and felt new.,0
(Nice Chromebook overall but has an issue where it does ...): Nice Chromebook overall but has an issue where it does not wake up from sleep. Tried to reset and that didn't work. Only resolution is to go to power settings and select keep display on and deselect sleep when lid is closed.,0
"(There is alot to cover with this laptop): So again there is alot with this laptop, id strongly suggest that you read everything i have to say.i give this laptop a 5 star because its incredible, the control center it comes with is very bad though. i had to delete it to be able to run better frames, when i first got it i hopped on fortnite immediately since my desktop is only a 2060 i was exited to so what a 3060 can truly do, as i got on i i turned on max frames and loaded into creative, i was lagging decently and my frames where at 140-40. i get 200+ on my 2060 so at first my heart sunk, i was so worried because i got this laptop as a basic replacement for my pc so i could have a dual pc setup, but i didnt panic to much, i thought about the reviews and they said the control center worked terrible, after i uninstalled it, which only took my 2 minutes, i was getting 400-500 frames everywhere in the game, i spent 400 dollars for my 27 inch gaming monitor, 240hz, but i swear this monitor is alot better, i was not playing better though because i had switch set ups completely but i can tell ill get better with tis laptop, i bought it for 1299, which i do believe is the best price for a 3060 and an intel core i7 11800H and a 240 hz monitor, i couldnt find anything better and i looked for 3 months straight. some bad things about the laptop, is that the battery is so BAD!!! if you want to have a laptop for all day then you'll have to go into settings and turn the hz to 60, now i dont think i need a good battery, i mean its actually not bad its just that its a gaming laptop its not meant to be unplugged for 9 hours straight, also the camera, the camera is terrible, not only is it at the bottom of the screen but the colors and frame and resolution you get on the camera is terrible, i would recommend this laptop if your only choosing it because it has a camera lolOther then that, i do believe that this laptop is truly amazingBy your favorite YoutuberLove NAFIN",0
"(Solid laptop. But know what you need for what you want to do): Laptop quality is pretty good. The IPS panel pairs well with windows 11. I would recommend going for the 16gb version as with all laptops. 8gb of memory is not enough for most takes in 2022. As I have pointed that out. This computer comes from HP with an insane amount of bloatware built in. The system will consume about 4gbs of memory just being turned on, and with the bios locked down. The average user will not be able to wipe the drive and freshly install windows.The I5 processor is surprisingly good. Averaging only a 4? decrease in performance against the I7 model.Not suitable for gaming IMO. But I would recommend to most pc users. Power users will know this is not what they are looking for.For price- it's a fabulous deal",0
(Great chromebook): This Samsung Chromebook is perfect for our needs. Great buy!! Perfect size.,0
(Excellent product!): The only thing that I dislike could be the cpu temperature because sometimes reach 90 celcius without warning and I must turn on the fans manually to control it (Windows 11) I've been reaching out for solutions and seems to be an optmization issue with W11,0
Little heavy not sure if I have a screen protector that would be a bummer afraid to to take off temporary.,0
(Hardware is solid): So when I received the computer I got started downloading everything playing some games and stuff. I noticed the screen acting weird and next day the screen is going in and out of working. It took 2 days for my screen to not work. The hardware in this laptop is great. But the quality of the build is why the price is good for this laptop. Screen is really flimsy and if you want to carry this in my backpack. I wouldn’t do it because it’s gonna flex. I ended up returning this because I just don’t want to deal with this issue at all in the future.,0
(No lighted keyboard): I have purchased several Acer Aspire 5 computers in the past with a key reason being the lighted keyboard.Bought two just a month ago and they had lighted keyboards. Bought this one a week ago and all of a sudden no lighted keyboard.,0
(Nice): Strong hardware.,0
"(Love it!): So far, so good! Runs very fast and allows me to upload pictures and create slideshows and videos quickly and easily! Love it!",0

"(Buen producto): Muy buen producto, me sorprendió lo compacta q es para ser una laptop de 15.5 pulgadas, la única pega es su pantalla que según el ángulo de visión pierde calidad",0
the screen feels a bit plasticky to the touch,0
(very clear screen): same brand I have had in the past and have been very happy with-great price,0
(Works perfectly): The light weight and screen touch. Personal,0
"(Great Laptop): Love it, I sometimes find the screen a bit small, but otherwise it is perfect. Fast lightweight, very happy.",0
The dedicated GPU is very basic but can handle most things you throw at it,0
(My clumsy fingers): The only drawback I've found is that the touchpad is huge and there are no actual buttons. That has presented something of a steep learning curve for me and my clumsy fingers. My old laptop had a small pad and physical buttons and I keep trying to tap them on the new computer which has none. Other than that the performance is what you'd expect from an i5 and the screen is above par. I've not used it in tablet mode with the included pen yet but the touch screen is quite easy in the regular notebook configuration.,0
(El precio fue muy bueno pero la calidad pésima): El precio fue muy bueno pero la calidad pésima en la pantalla muy mala calidad la batería no dura mucho me hubiera gustado poner unas imágenes pero la verdad la vine tirando al último,0

(Excellent Laptop. Better than I expected): This is the best laptop I have ever owned. Everything works as advertised. I had not realized it came with the finger print reader. My previous experience with one was a failure. This one works flawlessly. I have switched out the 120gb SSD for a 480gb SSD and added a 8gb stick of memory (12gb total). The extra bright screen is a joy to use. Overall the laptop is blazingly fast. At least to me. It is a joy to use and the price was right also.,0
"(Would Not recommend): I got a refund very easily, but with my experience, the OS was not downloading properly and my laptop kept shutting off and turning back on while I’m in the middle of doing my work. Would not really recommend.",0
"(Lightweight, appealing,): The LG Gram is appealing, lightweight and great for traveling. LG should consider an eighteen inch model.",0
(Three Stars): Nice looking. Keeps cutting off though.,0
(Must not be new as purchased): I bought this computer brand new. I think was previously owned because a random essay popped up when I was searching for my essay. Today I’m fixing up my resume and I went to push “tab” and it did not work.,0
"(A good thing): I am happy with this product, despite of low memory capacity. But the laptop works good till now. My only concerned was at the first time that I use the laptop because a line appeared in the laptop's screen but it won't appear again... I hope no. The positive thing about is very easy to use and carry.",0
Play's every game I have tried without issue.,0
"(Never Again): For the amount I paid, it wasn't worth it. I am a college student: Word does not work right, most Apps don't work right. I would not recommend buying it at all unless all you want to do is go on Facebook and read e-mails.",0
"(Very good laptop for multiple uses. Gaming, Design or Entertaining.): This Laptop is Amazing overall, the only problem I see is the camera location and the charging port location, besides that, this is a powerful machine. Very solid on gaming and design, fast and not too noisy. The RTX3060 inside works great.",0
"(Perfect machine): It just didnt come with original packaging. But it looks totally new to me. Even the Windows 10 key worked perfectly. It is a dual core i5 processor with 8 GB RAM and 500 GB HDD. The screen resolution is 1600 X 900. Also a touch screen. Plenty of USB ports, display port and a VGA port. It went through several Windows 10 updates once connected to internet which took several hours. Once everything updated, the machine ran awesome.",0
"(No issues/no problems): I wanted to wait until I had used this item for a couple of weeks before completing a review . There have been no issues and no problems and it arrived on time and at a good price. This is the second ACER I have had and both have been reliable with excellent battery life. It's a fairly basic unit but for what I use it for, I am pleased with it.",0

"(not a good computer): Update: after using it more and more this does not do what a regular computer does it is more like an oversized cell phone with the functions instead of a computer.Thisa great notebook for the price. My husband wanted one for himself but didn't want to spend the money. This is a good one. Good size, not expensive and does everything my $800.00 computer does.",0

(Good buy): It came quickly and is still working fine.,0
"(Calentamiento.): La laptop es buena, pero se calienta mucho incluso cuando está en el escritorio. Si la quieres para jugar tampoco es buena opción ya que HP le pone un límite a la VRAM de 512 MB, lo que reduce el rendimiento en juegos.",0
"(Good computer): I loved the computer; however, I was disappointed it didn't come with a pen. I also was disappointed because no pen was compatible with the computer. With that, I had to return it get something else that would be what I was looking for and what I could use for my business.",0
(Good laptop but did not meet my needs): Could not see very clear as I have low vision. Thank you,0
"(Perfect for College): Overall, it is great for any college student looking for a small, compact laptop that gets the job done. It is extremely useful for running several programs at once and multitasking (ie. Microsoft Office programs, different websites, statistical software). However, I have noticed that the battery life isn’t the best, especially when compared to my other laptop with similar specs, and the fan tends to be loud when performing larger tasks.Besides that, I honestly love it. It is lightweight and does what it needs to well; I’m happy with my purchase.",0
"(Best purchase ever.): Best purchase ever. I love the larger screen compared to my last chromebook that had a 11.6"" screen. It's lightweight and sturdy.",0
"(All was good until....): I was very happy with the laptop for almost 3 weeks when the screen didn't wake up after sleep mode. After turning it again the problem persisted so I contacted Lenovo for warranty. The problem is apparently I don't have coverage because I bought the computer in US and now I'm in another country. The computer can be a good machine (maybe I just had bad luck with a unnusual defect) but It's a bad experince since I'm still trying to figure how to return, change, refund or make the warranty valid. 0 for customer and warranty support from Lenovo.Update: Then the next day its working again, hope was some software issue.",0
"(Great laptop, but terrible repair/customer support): Laptop works great for just about everything, one downside to this model is that it overheats easy and very noisy when playing high quality games. If don’t mind the noise and toasty laptop it’s not bad. I’m actually happy with it’s performance, reason I’m giving it a 1 star is because I cracked my screen (my fault) and sent it for repair and acer wanted to charge me 699.99 (bought the laptop for 1.1k) for the repair of my screen only. Mind u the screen cost $300 at their 3rd party parts sellers and $140 elsewhere. Meaning they are charging at least $400.00 for labor of a 10 minute screen change which I ended up doing myself and buying the parts (works perfect now). Great laptop horrible repair practices at acer repair center, so don’t break yours in anyway or be prepared to pay.",0
(Great computer): Powerful fun computer. The battery doesn't last long but I think that's because the light thin case doesn't allow a large battery. Not a big deal,0
"(Hinge mount failure at laptop top cover plastic lid mount point during light use): XE521QAB has a ""common issue"" with this unit according to a Samsung Authorized Service Center. Hinge breaks away from plastic top cover mount. Official Samsung chat (website where you are logged in with your warranty info) will refer you to the Authorized Service Center who will tell you there is a ""Free of Charge"" repair, however Samsung must provide you with a Shipping label that has a Service Ticket Number included, in order for the repair to be covered under the One-Time Coverage. If you are six months out of warranty forget it. Not covered. I am not the first person to take time and energy to type this type of review. Look it up on leading big box stores website comments for this product. In my case I had bought two of the exact same models approximately a month apart, for personal use. I bought one and my spouse liked it, so we bought another since our existing Chromebooks were going End of Life soon. Here is the deal: The left hinge mount broke away from the top cover mount point (see photos engineers) approximately three weeks from each other. Personal use Chromebook, light usage by adults, broken hinges. Samsung USA chat support = no help.

can be charged by the supplied round plug-in charger or a 45 watt USB-C charger which is phenomenal since you can then carry one charger for the laptop and your phone,0
(nice small laptop): a little slow but adequate for home. could have included more apps for productivity,0
"(Great Gaming Laptop ,best at its price range!): Purchase date - August 2019Pros:Great GPU and CPU at this price range, plays almost any game on ultra settings above 60 fps. (some can cross the 100 fps mark depending on the game)Storage: Three storage slots provide a huge room for storage upgrades - 2x M.2 SSDs and 1x 2.5 inch drive bay.Memory: 16 GB is more than enough for gaming, at least for now.Screen: Not an expert on this but I know for sure that this 144 Hz screen works perfectly well with the GPU which can luckily boost the frames to the refresh rate provided so you're not throwing money down the drain.Design: Slim and thin relative to the old model; however a reduction in the blue aspects to make it look a little more sleek and elegant would've been admired. Nevertheless, the blue color does far better than the generic red ""color standard"" for gaming.The predator sense software is really straight forward and easy to use. The external turbo button makes it far more simple to quickly overclock the GPU and boost the fan speed. The connection with mobile phones however is clingy and doesn't always work.Cons:Straight up - Thermals. This thing gets extremely hot during any gaming session, the CPU reaches 90 degrees in some cases however its usually between 75 and 85 degrees depending on the game and room temp.Battery life on this laptop is not the best, 3 to 4 hours max on a full charge is the best you can pull out. Maybe more with fewer background apps but there is no way this thing gets beyond the 5 hour mark.Lastly- this thing is a fingerprint magnet and it is quite intimidating to clean very often due to the large marks that are just left on the body, but that's not a big deal.",0
I received numerous discolored vertical lines in a two inch slice of the screen,0
(NO BACK LIT KEYBOARD): This computer DOES NOT have a back lit keyboard as advertised. I am not happy about that at all. Otherwise it's ok for communications and business needs.,0
"(Excellent gaming laptop at fantastic price): Impressive CPU and GPU, IPS-level display, solid amount of memory, good sound, and best RGB keyboard make this a premium gaming laptop that comes at affordable price. I wasn't satisfied with the size of the 512GB NVME SSD that came with it, so I added a 2TB SATA in the available bay. The laptop can be a bit loud when the fans kick in during heavy GPU utilization, but that's expected! Love this laptop.",0

"(Durable, dependable and great value): Granddaughter loves it.",0
(Five Stars): Awesome,0
the speakers are pretty weak. I wish they were louder and had more bass presence.,0
"(Superb Build Quality, Awesome Delivery Speed): Before I start, I must say I am really impress with the delivery speed. I ordered this laptop (sold by Amazon and delivered by UPS) the night of Oct. 3rd, and it was delivered the morning of Oct 5th... and I live across the border in Canada! I had originally hoped to get the blue version from Taiwan, but it had been out of stock for weeks, so I got the black one from the States instead.The laptop body is very well built. Slim and full aluminum body, circular metallic pattern and ASUS logo that lights up when turned on, the glass trackpad and fingerprint sensor, ultra-thin bezel, perfect. There are four speakers: two on the sides, and two from the bottom front, resulting in loud and crisp sounds. Hinge resistance is just right as I can open the laptop single-handedly. Screen brightness is slightly darker and feels cooler than my last ASUS laptop (K43S) from 2011, but this is more comfortable for my eyes.Keyboard has slight flex, but sturdy, not as bad as some video online shows. I checked the lightbleed and found there is little to none for my machine, that's great. I do not really use SD cards at all, so the micro SD is a non-issue for me, but some people may not like this design. Performance wise, it's blazing fast. As a graphic designer / full stack developer, this is a perfect machine for my everyday professional work. As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say much about how this machine performs in gaming, so I will leave for others to review that, but for a light gamer this is more than enough. I have not get the time to see how ventilation works under heavy load, but with only two arrays of small vents at the back I suspect it may not be too well.I do have a couple issues with it though. First, the power bar is a giant brick. I did expect a powerful machine to have a bigger AC converter, but the size of it (about three iPhone7s stacked together) still startled me, and it weights about half kg. Second one is a bit troubling: the machine makes some small buzzing sound when some processes are running; it could be the coil whine some people are talking about. It's not loud, but it's audible in a quiet room so I might want to open it up and check one day.The issues aside, this is a very good laptop in terms of quality and performance. This is the laptop of choice for me this year, and I would definitely recommend it for professional users (though probably not gamers).",0
"(ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.): Garbage! Freezes, crashes from day ONE!!!!! Amazon wouldn’t help.",0
"(It’s very portable and light): Laptop looks amazing and works well like new with no problems at all, at first I was hesitated to order refurbished one because I had a bad experience with refurbished product in the past but I am so glad what I have now. I also have XPS 9550 with core i5 and 8 GB Ram for 2 years, fan noise is very annoying which is driving me nuts. The XPS13 with core i7 is one of the best laptops I have ever had, It’s very portable and lighter, but noticeably faster and quieter than XPS 9550. Video streaming, small gaming sessions, and web surfing all great! Great buy!!!!",0
"(Love the product, not the price): I am not a computer nerd, I use my computer to finish charts from work when I am at home or to just browse the web so the MacBook Air was all I needed. I love the screen, the keyboard, size, and weight.",0
"The seamless integration of my computer with my smart home devices has made life so much easier. Now, I can control and monitor my connected appliances, lights, and even security systems directly from my computer. This level of convenience and control is something I've always dreamed of.",1
"(Do not buy! Cannot keep wifi connection....): 20+ year IT person and cannot get wifi to stay connected. Tried update to driver, setting for adapter, sleep settings, etc. Pretty much useless and cannot return.",0
"(MAJOR USB PROBLEM - LAPTOP IS USELESS !!!): All right, I will be contacting Asus and my local computer repair shops but until this problem is resolved the 1 star rating will remain. I am eager to get this problem fixed and then to give this device the excellent product review that it deserves. But with the major problem I've been having with the USB ports this laptop is so unable to do what I need and want it to do, that I would not have paid more than AT MOST $150.00 for it as a back up on the road laptop. Thus far this is the only problem but it is huge.The problem is simple, none of the usb outlets recognize even half of my usb devices. My job requires me to travel and plug into numerous systems, and use numerous devices, all of which do so via USB. I know and respect the difference between the USB 2.0, 3.0, 3.1/Type-C, and Thunderbolt connectors. I have all the external adapters necessary to use any USB type connection on any and all USB ports but while this device lets me use my $1.00 wireless USB mouse it does not allow me to use even something so basic as an external monitor or a host of other common household USB connectable devices. I service a variety of devices that use legacy software systems and more modern systems. I need a USB driver that is compatible with all of these. I have scoured the web looking for tricks to make it work, I have tried all tricks no less than 5 times on 3 separate occasions. I have downloaded all sorts of USB driver software and other USB assistant software, but still I have gotten no results.I am very bothered by this and in need of assistance. I WILL change my review to a very positive one if I get the help I need (because the laptop is great apart from this glaring issue). If not this terrible review will remain. 12/04/2018",0
(Good looking): Looks good. Good deal for the price. S-mode can be upgraded to Windows 10 home with no costs,0
I am excited to use this for video production as well and imaging stuff very soon!,0
"(Great Laptop for Gaming!): I've recently been on the market for a gaming laptop capable of handling Cyberpunk 2077 up to my standards but at a good price: and this computer fits the bill.In the meantime the full RTX 2070 and i7 have handled everything I've thrown at it with no stutters (both programs and games) with great performance, all on max settings.The Steelseries RGB keyboard has mutiple preset / default options however you can also create new ones and customize them. Looks great, definitely one of my favorite features, even if it doesn't directly affect performance.As others have said, fans can get very loud when playing demanding games (especially when using the Cooler Boost option), but with headphones you'll be fine. However, this is expected for gaming laptops. I haven't tested how hot it gets, but overall you might think about getting a cooling pad.It does come with 512GB NVMe SSD, so if you keep lots of files on your computer or play games that occupy lots of storage, you'll probably need to increase space, for which fortunately there is.The build is sturdy, but the materials are a fingerprint magnet. Without a doubt you'll be cleaning this computer constantly.Battery life isn't exactly great, especially when gaming without a cord. But this isn't really a problem if you just take the cable with you.Overall, I'm very happy with this computer and has run with zero problems, both when playing demanding games and running multiple programs. I'd suggest it to anyone looking for both great performance and good price.",0

It is very snappy and the screen is great.,0
It works like a beast and transferring over my stuff onto this new one was super easy.,0
the GPU is pretty good and i like it,0
"(Battery not charging!!): I bought this laptop which seemed to have a lot of great reviews compared to others, but out the box the battery was not charging. The laptop works fine once plugged in with the AC adaptor, however the HP diagnostics says that the battery should be replaced. The laptop is now overseas and I do not know how to fix this problem. Does amazon have any options to return defective items from the Caribbean and what is the cost going to be? Very disappointing purchase!!",0
(Easy to use): So far I haven’t heard any complaints! It was purchased for my 8 yr old son. He basically set everything up himself. He uses it for school writing assignments. The best thing they did with it so far was track Santa on Christmas Eve!!,0

(Five Stars): I really like it,0
(Bought is as a gift): My sitter loves this laptop. It's works great.,0
"(Amazing Gaming Laptop): After a lot of research and price checking I decided to go with this laptop. Let me just say, I am so glad I did. The keyboard is unreal with the RGB. There's so many variations and combinations you can choose from. The screen is clean and clear, great color for gaming. The graphics card is a great combo with the i7-10th gen. I have been getting amazing FPS on the usual games that I play. Definitely recommend this product for people who can't afford $2500 laptops. The battery life isn't great, but that's expected with a gaming laptop. So overall I'm extremely happy.",0
"(Absolute junk): Keyboard would not work correctly, battery drained in less than an hour, with just idling going on, fTPM disabled itself every startup, causing computer to not start without extra interaction. You take your chances with a refurbished comp, and this one was definitely a lemon. Considering other reviews like mine, I suggest you give the refurbished version of what I got, ITB, 8GB RAM, VEGA graphics, etc, a pass.",0
"(This computer sends me a message that there is an ...): This computer sends me a message that there is an upgrade. Then its asks if I want to upgrade, it may not compatible with my system. Don't the company know whether the upgrade is for my computer? Not feeling this laptop at all. It has shut down for no reason other than a recent update and will not turn back on. I'm done!",0
The keyboard is very comfortable with good travel on the buttons also.,0
"(worst laptop ever): i bought this laptop, it only was 5 months till Microsoft released a windows update that stopped the touch screen from working and Microsoft cant fix it, lenovo cant fix it and amazon wont answer me.",0
"(Don’t buy > Lenovo is not what they used to be): Maybe it’s cognitive dissonance, but I want to like my X1. It’s light and sexy.From day one the camera would fail after a half of hour. It took 45 minutes on a call for the person to realize it was a hardware issue. Then the computer started to lock up and rebooting took 10 minutes after I got an error message. Quickly the new person said I needed to re-image. I repeatedly asked what was the problem. She couldn’t answer, all she could give me the solution.This last call like all the previous call was frustrating. The customer service people don’t know anything. They only read from a script. Often previous calls or actions are lost in their system. The order to send out a box to replace the camera was canceled. I’ve been on long holds only to be disconnected.When I owned a Lenovo laptop a few years ago their support was amazing—very knowledgeable and helpful. This time around in a dozen calls, I can’t say I had one person who knew more than me—that’s not good.I don’t fault the reps; I fault Lenovo—they aren’t training their people.Unfortunately, I would not recommend the X1 even though I would like to. The product is not reliable, and the service is worse; I now wish I ordered an HP business laptop. My previous laptops were HP Elites—their reps are techs, they actually help.",0

"(Very good for starter or amateur gaming. A few kinks but great): There is no touchscreen. Screen is amazing. Works very well when plugged in, not so well unplugged. Had some trouble with graphics card but it was just configured wrong. The fans make a weird noise as well but it gets quiet the faster it spins. Battery life is trash but that's to be expected. You should use an external keyboard when gaming because it gets very hot. Would recommend for starter gaming laptop.Update: That weird fan noise that I mentioned out of the box turned out to be a faulty component. The laptop burnt out almost exactly one year after purchase. If you hear a weird noise from your fan, return the product immediately or your computer will break like mine did.",0
The font on the keyboard is also not the most aesthetically pleasing thing in the world.,0
(I am In love): Just received it two days ago and I am in love. I put the fan in the max mode (cooler boost) as soon as I game and so far the computer hasn’t even heated a bit. The MSI dragon app is perfect for tracking it. Thermals are amazing and the RTX2070 IS A BEAST. And oh boy that screen and the refresh rate. Damn. Damn. I am in love. Speakers are way better than any laptop I’ve ever had.Cons : fans are extremely loud in coolerboost mode (but I mean who doesn’t game with a headset)I ran into a few issues with sound drivers but I’ve been able to solve them.,0
"(Not your average laptop.): Fingerprint magnet. A lot of updates for drivers and utilities, etc. From a Mac book to an MSI huge difference.",0
"(Best choice for college students): If you're a heavy user, go for the 16 gig model. The 8 gigs 8s good enough for day to day task, plus the battery is unbelievable. Easily goes for 2 days without worries",0
Difficult to open the lid. No tabs or lip for fingers to pry open with,0
(Fast): Easy setup fast start up,0
"(love the high quality screen, but the screen has air bubbles in it): This is a big laptop, which has pros and cons.+: the screen is really nice, videos and simple games look great on the big screen-: it's a little too big and heavy to use it in ""tablet mode""It's convertible, which seems cool, but 15.6 inches at 4.4 lb is really too big for a tablet. I do use it in ""tent mode"" to watch videos. It's easy to get fingerprints all over the screen though when you use it in touchscreen mode.The fingerprint reader is very convenient for logging in. It starts up quickly because of the SSD. Battery life is good. It's a great laptop for general usage.The one negative is that the screen came with some air bubbles in it. It's like a line of air bubbles near the bottom of the screen, and it's actually a very noticeable flaw on an otherwise high quality screen.",0
(dont buy if you want battery lifeover 3 hours): preformance is good. had some weird screen glitches. battery life is atrocious ive had it for a week. it lasts like 3 hours maybe 4 if i use it straight.,0

(Keys falling off): Keys starting to fall off already. This is baloney.,0
(Not very happy with the windows 11. It hasn't worked right from the beginning): Unhappy that it had error messages when starting and then connectivity problems after that. Came without a Windows 11 CD so I can't fix driver issues,0
"(Nice): Great for the price, bought it during Black Friday sale, also bought a Samsung ssd and added it to the laptop for extra storage.So far so good. Only one weird incident which I found the laptop lid itself’s plastic case was not yet closed entirely, exposing the interior parts. and when I close it, the whole monitor when crazy. But it was ok after restart. Weird, but it works well afterwards, so not going to return it at the moment.Nice monitor, the webcam’s quality is average but sufficient, as I have an external elgato webcam anyway. Intended to use it for 3D stuff when I am outdoors. Size is good, light and thin for travelling. Need to shop for a laptop bag lolNote: will be receiving a warranty extension for this feedback submission.",0

I do wish it had a little more internal storage,0
"(As described): So far, after 5 weeks, I'm pleased. Item is as described... no noticeable blemishes or damage and everything works as expected.",0
"(Buyer Beware: Horrible Screen Quality): This is an overall decent laptop in terms of specs, but I can't recommend it due to the horrible screen quality. The corners of the screen are incredibly bright and have an almost white tint to them. There is a very small angle of viewing where you will be able to clearly see everything on the screen, and if you move your head an inch the top/bottom will become very dark or very light. I even had to try using it in high contrast mode in order to make things look more clear/easy to read. I almost wish they just used a higher quality/lower res screen because this is awful.In addition, I know for a fact that this screen will break in less than a year. It feels incredibly fragile and the lightest touch will leave a temporary mark",0

"(Ubuntu Mate perfect for the hardware.): Bought this pc with the intent of installing a lightweight linux distro on it. When I received it, I spent 10 min playing around on it and found windows 10 to be slow. After some research, I installed Ubuntu Mate on it and it works like a peach! After installation there was about 20 Gb of free space and all the functions worked (bluetooth, web cam, hdmi port, ect.) . Its a lightweight distro that still carries alot of functions. However, do you research and install at own risk. Might not work/be for everyone.",0

"(Only works for a year): When it works it's a pretty good gaming laptop, has a good battery life, runs games well and has beautiful picture. Problem is after a year it's practically useless. I bought it in August of last year and now 1 week after the 1 year warranty expired the screen goes black and displays nothing, so if you do buy it at least be sure to get the extended warranty because it will stop functioning. Honestly itd be a much better option to sacrifice some of the performance for durability because 1 year of use is pretty pathetic.",0
"(Muy buen producto. Al igual muy buen servicio de envío): Recomiendo al vendedor al100% ya que se responsabiliza al 100% de cualquier tipo de cargo realizado en aduana(como lo indica en su perfil) precios no exagerados y accesibles, muy contento con el producto y con el tiempo de entrega a pesar de ser un envío internacional",0

This laptop comes preloaded with a lot of stuff.,0
"(Worth it): Time of usage: 1 monthType of usage: data processing, gamming, entertainment and microsoft officeI can only recommend this computer. For many years I have worked and sold laptops, and had become a fan of Toshiba. Nevertheless, after the company virtually fell apart I had to look for something new. My last computer was a Toshiba Satellite Ultrabook of 14 inches, i5 3rd gen.As you can imagine this computer was an incredible upgrade. This is why:Pros1. In contras with its counterparts, the material, even though it is not metal, is hard and apparently durable, this is not a high end computer, but it surly does seem like one.2. Style and elegance: again, its appareance is outstanding, specially if you are looking for somewhat gamming capabilities, I think it is perfect, no one will notice this is a gamming pc.3. Fan and ventilation: before buying the laptop I read many complaints about the fans and the heating. I can tell you that the double fan system works perfectly, it does heat up in extreme conditions of usage, but its no were near ""too much"". Along side that idea, I must mention that the fan sound is noticeable, but it is not anoying, nor will take your concentration away.4. Speed: I was extremely please to find out it is really fast for what I was expecting, even with up to 5 high demanding programs (Hadoop, photoshop, etc.) it keeps up as it was opperating only 1.5. Screen: You will see many comments and complaints about the screen. However, for me it is perfect, it does not reflect any glare, it can be really bright and awesome definition. Specially if you are a more or less regular user (work, etc.) I think it is really good.6. Backlit keyboard and bluetooth: work perfectly and surpassed expectations.7. Battery: The battery is pretty good, plus the settings that ASUS has incorporated are pretty good. However, it does not charge as fast as advertised, nor it lasts what it should unless charged fully and then unpluged.Cons1. Pad: the incorporated mouse is just too sensitive, specially using chrome you can expect zooming in and out many times while trying to scroll down, even though it can be solved by disabling some settings of the pad, it is anoying and uncomfortable.2. Recovery: for recovery purposes, the only option (at least in this win 10 version) for some reason is to burn it in dvd's, not in usb as in many computers.3. Charger: The computer itself is very light, but its charger is heavy and short.4. Keyboard: The ""F"" keys go before the function options which makes it uncomfortable, again, having used many other brands. The numerical path is really small.Overall, I do belive these are minor inconviniences, this pc on itself is awesome. You should look around, but this is a pretty good option. By why I could judge at the moment I bought it, it has no contestant in price or style. However, try to buy it on sale, as Amazon reduces 50-100 bucks every 2-3 weeks. Good luck on your search!",0
"(Great looking and great performance.): Amazing laptop. I got the UX435 with the screenpad 2.0. The screenpad is actually very useful. For those reluctant to buy this because of the low end graphics card, it has two thunderbolt 4 ports that you can easily add an external GPU if needed and still have one thunderbolt 4 port open. Great laptop overall.",0
"(ACER Predator 3060 is such a steal): This is a gaming laptop so don't be expecting 12 hr long battery life if you're doing things like gaming, 3d modeling, etc. I love the customizable keyboard and matte feel. The only con is 500GB storage is probably not enough unless you're constantly cleaning out storage and using an external hard drive, you can also put in your own ssd but the warranty will most likely be invalid if you do that so i suggest doing that after the warranty expires.",0
"(Four Stars): My niece is going to love it, it's not too big or too small.",0
"(From a casual user): I've always had about 600$ Toshiba's so this is my first laptop that was more than $1,000.I'm used to having a SATA SSD so casual usage isn't noticeably faster.Boot times and coming back from sleep actually seems to take longer I assume because this has windows 10 home and not pro which lets you disable the login screen.Purchased this at $1,299 after buying an Acer Predator Helios that arrived with screen bleed on first boot. Thought it might resolve itself with a windows update and did not so I returned it.The keyboard is a little bit more cramped and will take some getting used to but is super customizable.I'd like for the shift/fn keys to be backlit as well i.e. volume up/down and symbols.Most people seem to have one big gripe with the system and mine is the trackpad. Generic drivers, unknown manufacturer so I can't find a way to get momentum or inertia into use.The display is nice, passes the one finger test, doesn't wobble any more than other laptops I've had.I Haven't used it on battery yet, at least not for any stretch of time.Does not have a mux switch, uses some NVidia thing to manage GPU.6GB Video card according to DirectX.The camera is at the bottom of the screen so if you place it low, you get a low angle.I haven't had issues with the AORUS control center app. Seems to work just fine.8/27/22 Update: Aorus control center app is a nightmare to get working.Doesn't get any louder than my old Toshiba with casual use.Doesn't get noticeably warm with casual usage.The bird on the back of the screen does light up white when on.My favorite part so far is that the Wifi on this system seems to be so much faster than my Toshiba. Imgur switches posts really fast. Followed by the screen.Pictures:2nd SSD Slot, components, RAM, motherboard overall, and lastly the back of the laptop lid at night.Note: All the screws to remove the laptops underplate appear to be the same length, also was pretty easy to remove compared to some other laptops which really snap a lot when you open them.",0
(it was a gift and my grandaugh loves it.): it was a gift and my grandaugh loves it.,0
while setting up I got to the fingerprint part of setup and it locked up,0
IT WONT TURN ON,0
"(2 stars on this laptop.): Noticeably fragile, weak even, not physically but in its functionality. It runs much of anything you'd want to run, but often with difficulty. In many cases the entire thing will just get slow. For example, sometimes if booting up on low battery, it will have a distorted screen and take longer than usual. Disappointing.",0
(My first MacBook): It's definitely a learning curve considering all my life I've used windows. Overall I do love the lightweight and portability of the laptop and I'm glad I made the purchase it's fast and really not that bad of a price everything is experience these days,0
(Easy light weight ebook): Just perfect for an elderly person to use instead of a computer.,0
"(5 months in, already dead.): Well here we are 6 months later. The laptop stopped charging or working about a month ago. I’ve tried to find other chargers for it and that didn’t work either.",0
(You get what you pay for): This computer does the basic functions as expected. The screen quality is not great but I purchased for my 10 year old and he is hapy with it. I would just be aware it isnt AMAZING by any means. But it is good for price :),0
"(Very muscular laptop): This laptop has everything you will need to game in high quality and in VR. You will definitely hear the fans especially during the Cooler Boost 5 feature. However, rest assured it will probably never get dirty inside if you game often and/or run the Cooler Boost 5 from the button on the keyboard. Some people have reported that changing out the CPU thermal paste helps keep temps down but that is risky if you haven't done this many times. Other than running a bit hot under load and very powerful fans, you won't find a better 15"" laptop for the price.",0
(Being online is fun....again!!!!): No more MicroSoft! What a relief to just get online and actually enjoy NOT having the Windows 10 updates choking my computer down.,0
(Great bargain): This laptop is very fast has tons of space and enables me to get my work done.,0
"(Great customer service): What a value, and amazing customer service . Highly recommend if u need a great computer at a very affordable price",0
"(Incredible for the Price): I've owned this laptop for about a month now and I must say that I am really enjoying it so far. After a lot of deliberation and a lot of reading conflicting reviews, I decided to give this laptop a shot because my other computer is an ASUS ROG laptop that is still going strong seven years after its purchase.As a student, I need a laptop that is very portable and capable of doing a variety of work. I primarily use this computer for coding in Visual Studio and other platforms such as Unity. I am a game design and development major, so I spend a lot of time coding games and working on web development.The first thing about this laptop that I noticed out of the box is how lightweight it is. I can easily pick up up with a single hand and carry it in my backpack without even noticing it's in there. In addition, the size feels just right for me. The screen is easy to see and the keyboard feels nice to use. It fits my hands pretty well and none of the keys feel our of reach nor do they feel cramped together. I also like how the touch pad works, which is a must for somebody who doesn't want to carry around a mouse.Some people have complained about battery life, and I have noticed that I can work for several hours without needing to be plugged in. If you are playing games or watching a lot of videos on this machine, you will probably burn the battery quickly, but I've gone days without charging it- but I usually only use it in short spurts.People have also complained about low memory, but once again I haven't had a single issue here. I think some people expect, as my mom would say, a machine that can fly you to the moon and back without paying for a rocket-ship. It's a silly saying I know, but it's definitely a common attitude.My only complains about this computer are very minor. Other people mentioned the screen is a bit wobbly when you unfold it, and I've noticed that if you or something else bumps into the desk or table the computer is on, the screen wobbles pretty violently. I'm not a computer expert and couldn't tell you if this is an actual issue or not. I've learned through experience working with electronics that buyers often expect a products weight and sturdiness to be an indication of its value, when in reality most products simply add weights to the inside of a product to make it seem better without actually adding anything useful to the design, so maybe screen wobble isn't a huge deal- I'm not an expert.So in conclusion, if you need something fast, reliable, and portable that you need for working on moderately-demanding projects, this is your laptop. Don't expect to go gaming on it or binging Netflix for hours on end without plugging it in, but it can handle a lot of tasks very easily.If anything changes over time, I'll be sure to come back and edit this review.",0
"(great price for a remarkable product): This company is outstanding and to my surprise, the Chromebook preforms on a superior level...",0
"(Just so slow): This Acer Chromebook functions, but not well. All I use it for is Google Chrome, and I don't do anything data-intensive like streaming videos or games -- just basic browsing, Google Docs, etc. This machine is SO slow, and it has been from the time I bought it a few years ago. I kept thinking that the frequent Chrome updates would fix the issue, but they never did. This is my second Acer Chromebook and I think I'm just done with this particular manufacturer. Yes, they're cheap, but if it takes you minutes for a webpage to load when it takes seconds on another machine, you're just wasting your valuable time.",0
"(Just what I needed): I needed a laptop to work from home. Basics email, spreadsheet, and access on my company’s online system. Some entertainment here and there.I researched every affordable laptop I could find. I read articles on brands, ram and features. Asus is obviously underrated. The brand name kept popping up as a favorite. But I had never owned or used one.I received this laptop today and immediately fell in love with the sleek, slim and simple look. The keyboard feels good and I love that it has a 10 key without being bulky and bigger. I uninstalled several defaulted apps, downloaded chrome and tested it out. The screen quality is better than some reviews I read. The sound quality is acceptable. I don’t plan to jam out on it. And if I stream videos or movies, I’d rather use my ear buds. It runs quickly and I never felt it get hot. The fan has a nice low hum. Just enough to softly let you know it’s there, doing it’s job.Overall, I’m super happy with my purchase. I’m not a gamer and I don’t download much outside of reports for work. I think this is perfect for what I need. Unless something drastic happens, I cannot see myself updating my review to anything less than 5 stars.",0
"(A perfect mix.): Between the 10th generation Intel processor and the outstanding Nvidia RTX 2070, the MSI GL65 delivers amazing performance and visuals for the games that I want to play. Right off the bat the GL65 has shown frame rates I have dreamed of for a long time and the added RTX is just the cherry on top. Anybody who is looking for a new gaming laptop to satisfy their gaming needs I HIGHLY recommend the MSI GL65 Leopard 10SFK-062.",0
"(Almost perfect but killer touchpad wobble. Beware of Dell support.): The laptop is gorgeous but beware of the touchpad as it wobbles and has like a false click when you're using it; this is by now a known issue and my unit was affected by it. I'm evaluating my replacement options right now but it seems it's hard to get an unit without this or worse issues.Update1: Dell wants to replace the part with an on-site technician visit but they are backordered. Will update this review if this works.Update2: Almost 30 days after purchase and 20 days since contacting support Dell has not scheduled the technician visit as the order is backordered. Beware when buying this laptop, a lot of them present this issue.Update3: I have received 3 units of this laptop so far (two replacements). The QA is really bad, they all had touchpad or screen issues, the latest one having flex to click issues (google: ""flex to click xps 9500""). BTW the technician visit on update2 was never scheduled and the ETA was moved up twice. If you're picky with touchpads or quality of your purchases don't buy this model. Reducing my review to one star.",0
The keyboard gets warm,0
(Four Stars): Only complain should have more memory and be touch screen.,0
"(Excellent gaming laptop for the money): I've been blown away by how well this laptop performs for the price I paid for it. I'm very happy with my purchase. Setup was a breeze. My games have run flawlessly. The battery may be an issue for some. I usually keep my laptop plugged in so it's not an issue for me. There's an option to stop the battery charging at 80% which will extend the life of the battery when you keep it plugged in like I do, so that option is very useful to me.If you're on a budget and you want a decent gaming laptop, I'd recommend this one with maybe some tinkering to help with a shorter battery life.",0
(Limited drive space): Great pc for the price. I would recommend purchasing an external ssd via usb or usb-c. The drive space is very limited. Overall though I would highly recommend this for performance and the $ value. This is my second Asus and they really run great and last a long time.,0
"(Has DVD): I have owned several laptops over the years, some good, some not so good. this machine is every thing I hoped it would be. Light weight, Quiet, not a sound, Almost no heat, maybe both because of the SSD drive, If it has a fan I have not heard it yet. Graphic is great, pictures are clear with good color. Screen is clearly visible from any angle, not just dead on. I it hooked to both of my HP printers without having to load any software. I did not know it had a DVD, missed that in the specs, glad it does.Only down side, there is sharp edge on the bottom when the screen is in the open position. I know it is designed to raise the back end for good airflow. May prove to be a problem on my leg. I don't know why they did not at least round the edge instead of having it so sharp. Still the best laptop I have ever owned.",0
(It’s so good): Battery life and screen quality,0
(Todo muy bien): Pista dise?o muy bien,0
"(Decent work laptop, not touchscreen, battery doesn't hold charge.): Overall a decent laptop for work mainly using web browser to complete my task. The battery never really held a charger longer than an hour and after three months it didn't hold a charge longer than 10 minutes. After five months the laptop won't work unless plugged in.",0
"(The great little laptop): I've now had this laptop for a month, and I am delighted with my purchase. There's a lot about this laptop to love too. It is lightweight, which makes it very portable, so you don't mind taking it with you. The solid aluminum body is strong, although it can flex if you're not careful. The fingerprint scanner works wonderfully. While the specs say the battery can last UP TO 12-hours, my experience has been that it lasts closer to 10-hours, which still isn't bad. The 8th generation i5-8250U processor, 256GB SSD drive, and 8GB of RAM make for a fast user experience. I've had tons of tabs in Google Chrome open, multiple MS Word documents open while streaming music with no problems.While a great laptop, there are a few things I don't like about it. First would have to be the location of the power button, which is next to the 'delete' key. On multiple occasions, I've hit the power button while editing a document. I changed to the power button to put the laptop to sleep when you hit the power button, so I didn't lose any work, but it is still frustrating. My only other complaint so far is that neither the RAM nor the SSD drive is upgradeable. Using an external SSD drive solves the storage issue with negligible performance differences, so that issue has a workaround. As for the 8GB of RAM...",0
"(Love this little machine!): I got this machine in September 2018 to replace a 7 year old Acer TimelineX 3820T. The old laptop was typical low budget plastic construction, and the plastic was just starting to fall apart. I waited for a year to post my review to make sure there were no surprises. This laptop has been a steady daily driver for me, and I would definitely purchase again. I love the all-aluminum body, and the screen is more than bright enough for my old eyes. Two of my must haves were that the machine have a non-glossy screen and no touchscreen! (I have seen too many cracked touchscreens on laptops... I leave them to tablets and phones.) I added a second 256 gb SSD and installed Linux Mint on it, so I can dual boot and eventually kick Windows for good. The build quality is very solid and unlike a lot of laptops, you can actually use it in your lap without it frying your thighs! I did have a small problem with the screen not wanting to turn on a couple of months ago. I am a computer repair tech, so I opened it up and reseated both ends of the video cable after disconnecting the battery and that sorted it out. Other than that minor glitch, I have been very happy with this purchase and will consider getting an updated Acer model when this one needs to be replaced. I even ordered the exact same model for my boss at the time, and she loves it too!",0
"(Laptop is pretty slow with videos): So I wanted something inexpensive to do basic things. Watch Hulu or Netflix and download music on iTunes. iTunes works well enough but I don't know why watching Hulu is so problematic. It'll stutter frequently and it's not from poor internet speeds, it has to do with the speed of the laptop. Videos will become pixelated and there video will pause but the sound will continue. I actually decided to NOT use my laptop for watching videos which is quite disappointing to say the very least! I wasn't expecting much because I wasn't needing much, but apparently it can't even handle videos. Maybe mine is deffective, I don't know. Pretty disappointed unfortunately.",0
(Awesome chromebook): I love this. Works great and is fast for what I need it for.,0
(Lenovo is great value for the money): I'm very impressed with Lenovo,0
"(Mucho mejor de lo esperado): Después de un a?o de uso puedo decir que es un buen producto, tiene un slot para otra ram, tiene un puerto el espacio y los tornillos para un disco duro 3,5""Aun funcionando como el primer dia.",0
(It takes so long to restart.): There has to be a problem with the operating system.,0
(Very well functioning laptop): My first chromebook that I bought for my boyfriend. This chromebook works well and it is pretty big. It's pretty fast and easy to use. The battery last long and the speakers are pretty loud. So far no problems and I will definitely will recommend this laptop.,0
(Great Cheap Laptop): This is a great fast laptop. I bought it at $398 and it is worth every cent. The only issue I have is that the speaker volume is too low. Even while on 100%. Asus will respond and tell everyone who reports this issue (There are many) to uninstall and reinstall the driver. Or to send the laptop in for repair. But this low sound is a design defect. Reinstalling drivers won't do anything. And unless Asus redesigns the speaker system sending the laptop in for repairs won't fix anything because it's not broken. It's a design defect. Asus used cheap speakers and placed them on the bottom of the laptop. Sound is always muffled and low. Other than the sound I really love this laptop.,0
"(Amazingly powerful laptop): This is definitely one very powerful laptop. The display is amazing, the bootup time is incredibly fast, and I haven't been able to throw anything at this beast that it was not able to handle with ease. Considering what is packed in this thing it is surprisingly light. The build seems really solid and the look of the device is low key, not super flashy, and it looks really professional. The only things that I have noticed is that this thing picks up fingerprints like crazy, the arrow keys and page up and page down keys are in a place that seems unfamiliar to me (I am also used to using a 15.6"" laptop and this is a 17.3""), I'm not that big of a fan of Windows 11 (no fault of the device here), and this thing blazes through battery life, on the entertainment setting I got about 2 to 2 1/2 hours (although this was expected based on the specs). I've only had this for about 2 days but I have greatly enjoyed it so far.",0
(Muy buena!): La potencia que tiene a la hora de jugar y trabajar ya sea como productor o dise?ador gráfico. solo veo un único punto que no me agradó mucho que son las temperaturas a la hora de jugar juegos muy exigentes,0
(Dies alot): Sent this is for a second time. For repair,0
"(Misleading description): Just bought this laptop and received yesterday 1/11/22, description said it comes preloaded with windows 10 S mode, when I turned it on it was preloaded with windows 11 S mode. Can't revert back to windows 10 because Microsoft only gives you a 10 day grace period to do so once windows 11 has been installed, God only knows when that was, so now I'm stuck with a brand new laptop with windows 11, the only way back is to attempt a full installation of windows 10, which probably isn't free, and hope everything works out afterward. Amazon you need to accurately list products so that others don't suffer the same fate!!!!!!!!!",0
"Although I paid for a an over night shipping, this unit came in much later than then what when it's supposed to be delivered.",0
"(Se apaga aleatoriamente): La compre hace dos meses y se empezó a apagar aleatoriamente, a alguien le pasa algo similar?",0
the fans get very loud when playing games.,0
great performance and nice looks and small weight,0
(It's a good computer): It's as advertised.,0
"(Screen is horrible, but not a bad little laptop): Runs fast, boots up almost immediately. My only issue is that the screen is really bad.The main issue with the screen is viewing angle. I think some other people have brought up that many of the positive reviews are of the previous model year (same model, a year prior) which had a much better screen. Viewed from below perpendicular it gets dark very quickly. Viewed from above perpendicular and it washes out almost immediately. View head on and the top will be dark while the bottom is bright and washed out. Using the home screen and bright apps it's not too bad, but trying to watch videos it's unbearable.",0
"(Checked all boxes): This checked all the boxes for a gaming machine at the office and on the road. It has been put to work and I have only been impressed with the capability. Don't quite to max out settings on top end games or start dropping frames, but very capable of running anything on some relatively high settings. To be expected, but it blows some serious hot air when putting that 3060 to work. Unfortunately, it blows onto a right hand running a mouse anywhere close to it. I find a cooling base necessary for moving air away if working in tighter area or on lap.",0
(Came as pictured): The laptop is a gift for my sisters 40th birthday,0
The right shift key is smaller than a normal keyboard,0
It does come pre-loaded with a lot of bloatware,0
"(Incredible Value): This is my 3rd ASUS laptop. I keep buying them because they are, in my view, the best all-purpose laptops out there. Lightweight, perfect for travel, extremely reliable and fast - this laptop is an incredible value for the price. Love the anti-glare screen (needed because I have sensitive eyes). The laptop arrived super fast but because of annoying Windows 10 updates, it was a few hours before I was able to actually use the machine. Despite complaints from others, my laptop runs very quietly. And although some reviews recommend this laptop only for ""light"" video editing, I have already done extensive editing and video rendering without any issues at all. My only complaint is the small 250 GB hard drive, but understandable at this price point. Be sure to carry plenty of external storage and you'll be in great shape with this amazing laptop.",0
(Great product!): This laptop is definitely a 5 star. I use it for gaming and the graphics are great for the price. I don't even have problems with lag anymore. I love the fact the keyboard even lights up.,0
the audio on my unit where it was cracking and having interference.,0
"(Really love Chromebook!): Typically use an iPad at home. Purchased this specifically to create documents for a Bible study class. Set up easily for this user with little tech knowledge. Connected to my wireless printer. Chrome Store allows me to have apps and easy/quick access to some of my favorite idea (Pinterest, etc...) and reference sites (like Bible Gateway) and Amazon Prime Music app. App access means this would be suitable for someone who wants to surf the web or gamers or for entertainment, like Netflix. Google docs is so easy to use. Perfectly meets my needs at a very affordable price.",0
"(Great laptop, extremely good value for money.): Pros- Plays every (2020) game at 1080 at max settings.- Runs cool with undervolting via intel xtu app.- Good screen.- Good keyboard.- Easy to upgrade ram- Easy to upgrade ssd- Common, loads of help available online for any issues if you ever have any.Cons- None.",0
"(Very dark screen): I received my asus zenbook ux330ua today and was so excited to begin working on it. However, I immediately noticed how dark the screen is and even when I adjust the screen brightness to the highest setting, it is still very dark. I was very disappointed about this. I have attached a picture to show a comparison between the screen brightness of a hp laptop and the asus I just received.",0

(I?it): ?????,0
"(Definitely worth the money): A great laptop with a RTX 2070 and 10th gen intel processor. You're able to add a secondary 2.5 inch SSD if you like. Any game I've ran so far, Cyberpunk 2077, Doom Eternal, or Gears 5 runs great. You're getting a good gaming laptop for sure, but the battery life isn't good when you're playing a game for more than an hour.",0
"(Excellent price! Play store apps now compatible, lags at times.): Compact design, good battery life. good screen size, good keyboard and mediocre speakers. For the price you can't go wrong. For those who don't know a Chromebook uses the chrome browser instead of dedicated apps. However that just changed with the newest update. You can now download and install apps from the playstore! This is a game changer for Chromebooks, which were previously held back by only using the chrome browsers (a few app exceptions). That being said, Chromebooks are still predominately web browsing laptops, as some apps from the playstore may not work correctly or be buggy. If you are unsure if a Chrombook is right for you, do this test for yourself. Avoid any apps on your pc / laptop, open the chrome browser and run everything through chrome for about a week. If you find you can complete 90% or more of tasks then pull the trigger and get one! You won't regret it. If however you rely on incompatible apps, or just find sticking to chrome isn't for you then you may want to avoid a Chromebook.Cont. Samsung is an overall great brand and you will enjoy this product. Be aware, these usually aren't very powerful so you may run into bouts of lag, crashes, and in compatibility. Videos tend to load slowly, but once buffered offer a seamless experience. My model has 4 gigs of ram. I think once these start shipping with a tad bit more ram it will be in that perfect sweet spot of saving money without too much sacrifice.",0
"(After only two months of mild usage, keyboard keys are broken): Great laptop, but very low quality keyboard. After two months of very mild usage the up down arrow keys have broke. This makes me feel bad about my purchase, as I cannot find part replacement for those anywhere.",0
"(Not good for school): Not a bad laptop but it depends what you need it for. I needed mine for college and it’s not compatible with Microsoft apps (word, excel) so I needed to return. Otherwise worth the $",0
(Trash): This thing can barely load a webpage let alone watch a video. Half the time it just keeps restarting. I wouldn't buy this. If I wasn't deployed to Afghanistan I would return this. I'm pissed.,0
(Absolute value for money.): Cheap and good.,0
"(Solid performance, some flaws): Overall, this is a good laptop, for gaming or not. I tried it out initially with the installed Windows OS. Then, I completely removed that an put on Ubuntu. The install worked flawlessly and the video card worked with the OS. Performance of the laptop itself, especially the SSD and the video card are great. I've tested it with several different games on Steam and it installed and ran them all, just fine. The quality of the video is pretty good too. With the spinning disk having 1tb of room, you have tons of storage. It supports USB and USB-C. It has output for HDMI and you can plug it right into your network (as well as WIFI of course).Now, there are a number of nits I have with the laptop. First, the keyboard. The keys have a mushy, soft, unresponsive feel. What's worse, because of the inclusion of a number pad, the keys are offset. If you are literally holding the machine in your lap, to have it centered, your right arm is a little awkwardly place. Or, you get your arms centered and then the laptop is kind of falling between your knees. I can see why you would want arrow keys as a separate input for gaming, but the number pad. Either way, adding that makes the laptop awkward to use.Next, the spinning rust disk. It adds a lot of storage, but it also adds weight and power consumption. I'd rather see double the storage on the SSD and have no spinning disk at all if it reduces the weight of the laptop and makes the battery last longer.Speaking of the battery, I could only get two hours of life out of a charge. Don't plan on taking this on a long airplane flight unless there's a power supply.It is a nice looking laptop, stylish and although plastic, doesn't feel cheap. The mount between the screen and the keyboard does feel a bit less than solid, so you could see problems there over time.I like the laptop quite a bit and will get work out of it as well as game time. However, the awkward key placement and especially the short battery life makes it a ""home only"" machine. I wouldn't want to travel with it for fear I'd be only part way through a long flight and no longer have a laptop for games, videos or even doing work.",0
(I would definitely recommend this chromebook): I use this product for work and it is great i have not had any problems with it,0
(Best thing ever): I love this. Have had it a month with no problems. Definitely would buy it again.,0
"(Snapped after light use. Low Quality): I loved this thing for 6 months until this morning when opening it and the screws holding the hinge to the screen pulled out, cracking the screen. I contacted Samsung and they said they did not warranty their hardware. This is a poor craftsmanship.",0
"(Mid-range price but high-end performance): I'm not a gamer - let's get that out there right off the bat. I have no idea if this laptop would suit gamers, but as a teacher who uses MS Office, Google Apps for education, and Zoom extensively, this laptop is great. I also use a few molecular modelling and other memory-intensive science apps and have found no issues at all using this device. The display is vibrant and touchscreen is sensitive but not overly so. The touchpad was easy to adapt to (I am primarily a mouse guy) and is a very convenient size. Overall, I really like this machine and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good all-around laptop at a respectable price.",0
"(Just Buy It): Can't add much that hasn't already been said. I upgraded from a 2017 MacBook Air and find this to be superior in just about every way. The battery life is at least twice what the 2017 was, the screen is much better, the keyboard is better, the overall size of the computer is smaller and I love the larger haptic feedback touchpad. I don't use the camera but it isn't the greatest from what I understand and I do kind of miss the magsafe connector.",0
The power button LED is blaring super bright red,0
"(Counter Strike ) and this card shoukd be able to push these games at 80+ FPS on max settings but I am sad to say that this is not the case): I bought this laptop for school and for some light gaming on the side ( League Of Legends, Counter Strike ) and this card shoukd be able to push these games at 80+ FPS on max settings but I am sad to say that this is not the case. First LoL played fine at max settings at 100+ fps but there was terrible image tearing. Then I activated Vsync and it solved that problem. Steady 60fps then I installed CS:GO and it looked terrible. 100+ fps but nothing I tried fixes the issue. After updating drivers and changing the default graphics driver to the 1050 It just made everything worse. LoL never got past 30fps and csgo looked the same. This was disappointing.The screen is a TN panel which I understand has bad viewing angles but this tn panel has TERRIBLE viewing angles. It was very very bad. Not sure if it had anything to do with the bad gaming experience with low fps and such.On the brighter side.... The build was very nice. A metal build with backlight keyboard were a plus. Ssd speed was good too. Battery life was average and weight and dimensions were on the smaller side.This laptop doesn't feel cheap but unfortunately it just doesn't perform as well as it looks.",0
(Motherboard died after 6 months.): The 3rd party repair shop wasn't able to fix b/c asus doesn't sell parts. Having difficulty getting the email for the rma. Process to resolve motherboard failure is taking too long.Update: The asus website is unable to process the serial number on the device.,0

The screen looks great and has thin bezels due to Asus removing the webcam and packing it separately.,0
"(Is it really worth 1k dollars?): It looks nice but it doesn’t perform as I expected it still freezes and slows down for some reason and when I switch tasks it takes up to 10 seconds to respond even though it had 16 gb of 3200 megahertz ram. I had very high hopes for this laptop as it was recommended by all gamers, editors and users but it just doesn’t work as I would expect a $1k laptop should. It graphics are amazing but the response time was what I was disappointed with. It was good at gaming for the first round but slowed down on frame rates at times. The legion began over heating when I used it for simple tasks like watching YouTube videos too and the sound from the fans was higher than anything I was watching. There is also the issue of the constant internet connection where it will keep disconnected from existing WiFi connections. Now it shows a blank screen when I close a task and won’t let me get out of it either.",0
(Fast laptop): This laptop will do everything you need and quickly. It is great for gaming. The colors and response time are top notch. It is thin and light for taking with you wherever you want to game.,0
(Purchase my first laptop.): I purchased this laptop a few months ago and so far so good. I love it! I have to get used to the Microsoft part of it but all in all it's been a great laptop for a great price.,0

I even had to call to see why it was not shipped or why there was a delay and of course I got someone who don’t speak English and all they kept saying is there was no expedited shipping on this item. Update your shipping methods. Glad I didn’t need this in a rush. For a product that cost 2k should have shipped the next day, they ship $3 items much faster than this one.",0

"(Turns off on its own): I hate being that guy who only writes reviews when negative but this has become impossible to ignore. As a university student, I need my laptop functional and to do the simplest of tasks, have a working browser and stay on. Throughout my owenship of this device for over a year, it turns on and off frequently, at least one an hour, while working and thank goodness for auto save if not I would have a link for where I have smashed this laptop on youtube. This is a massive problem and I noticed only on most recent acer products. I have never had issues with laptops doing this before, and I work IT, which means it is linked to the hardware or some sensitivity that forces this to happen. Please, troubleshoot this issue as I now have to spend another $700 or more on a laptop now because there is no way I can make another semester with this migraine.",0
"(Incredibly fast, incredibly thin. If you are due for computer upgrade, this is for you!): I wanted a new MacBook since it's been several years since I got my last Mac and the battery was going bad.With a delicious gold color and an overall thin, sleek design, this computer is for those who want their computer to look a bit more ""fancy"" than other options on the market.With the M1 chip, everything is extremely fast. I was able to set up this new machine with 10 minutes.I am not sure if I would recommend this machine to those who have recently upgraded to a Mac (2017 to now) but if it's been several years and you want to splurge, go for this.As a writer, the keyboard is so smooth and I feel like I can type more words per minute on this machine.My only complaint is the webcam, while better, is still not up to par to other computer cameras on the market. FaceTime looks a bit grainy still and Photo Booth is just a joke. The quality barely looks different than recent models.Overall, this is a great addition to the Mac family. I look forward to see how Apple utilizes the M1 chip in the future.83/100",0
(.): This is worth the price. Fast start. Fast.fast fast on all,0
(What am I doing wrong?): This computer is very slow and glitches with my sons school work.,0
(Recommended Buy if you like Apple products..): okay I will start with the good about Apple.. my daughters last laptop lasted 10 years(2 batteries and the pad cracked).. started failing.. we bought her this new 2022 Macbook Air laptop M2.. it weighs very little like a heavy cell phone.. also doesn't heat up as much.. so far has worked just like her last one so far pretty good.. the new operating system software made it impossible to move her Office products over so she put in LibreOffice which is free and it mimics Office pretty well.. it uses USB 4 Thunderbolt ports and you have to buy adapters to use USB drives etc.. they're pretty cheap so not a big problem.. there's a new 1 TB flash drive for a good price(30$) on Amazon right now.. adds storage and backup.. has dual USB 3 and 4 which will work on this laptop.. USB 4 is Thunderbolt.. if you like Apple and need new laptop for 1200 bucks you should get this one..,0

"(Does not play well with printers): I tried to set up a wireless printer. Didn't happen. Got a different printer.Needed a chord for it to work. Connected to my phone with no problem.A few days later tried to print again , didn't happen. Printed from my phone , again, no problem.If you need to use hp chromebook with a printer DON'T get one.I also found out while talking to tech support, for over 3 hrs, the security isn't the best.I will never own another chromebook let alone hp product again.

(Piece of junk): Absolute POS! Any off angle and you can not see the screen. The Chrome operating system is BS like trying to learn how to use a garbage Mac. Do yourself a favor and just buy a cheaper Windows 10 laptop and save your headaches. If you know how to use Linux then it might be a good option. Otherwise stay away from Chromium. Your phone is easier to use than this crap.,0
(Box it comes in is basic): I only just opened the box. I am still using it. Key board is a bit different then I am used to and the box it comes in is surprisingly basic - expected something more along the lines of the graphics card boxes. Otherwise so good so far. It did freeze one me once already. But so far I am happy with it.,0
(Great product): I really enjoy using my chromebook. It is reliable and extremely easy to use.,0
(Five Stars): A very good choice for those who looks for a high performance laptop for gaming purposes!,0
"(Heats too much & poor battery life): This might be the one of the lightest and unbreakable laptop. Slow clap. But it has major issues1) This version, despite being priced at $2,100 (versus others priced at 1600-1800) does not have SIM slot o Micro SD slot.2) There are major heat and noise issues with the laptop. I have been getting weekly BIOS updates and none has resolved the issue.2a) When connected to charger:Using Hardware monitoring tool, I can see that even under normal usage of Office applications, the laptop is over clocking to above 3 GHz (instead of staying below, much much below even the 2.0 GHz. No amount of configuratin in BIOS or even using Intel's XTU (Extreme Tuning Utility) has resolved the over clocking.As a result, the temperate is always between 60-70C and results in fan running nearly all the time.This will also significantly reduce the life of laptop.2b) When not connected to charger,There is no over clocking (Good!) but CPU still keeps running at almost full power of 2.0 GHz and this reduces battery life to barely 4 hours (screen brightness 80).Both 2a and 2b point to crappy software by Lenovo and crappy updates that have failed to make any dent.",0
"(Research Windows 10s Operating System Before you Buy): I bought this just to keep handy in the kitchen when I need to pay bills or look things up quickly. I knew it wasn't going to be super quick and thought that I wouldn't mind it. However, I have found out that I do. Response time switching windows, apps or websites is slow. It is super light, which I love but the quality is really cheap. I'm being very careful with it because I feel like it could break easily. The hardest thing was converting the OS from 10s to 10. I didn't know that the S meant ""security?"" I think? Basically it means you can't download anything to the computer that is not found in the Microsoft Store. That was extremely frustrating because I am a Chrome Girl. I figured out how to upgrade it and now it's a normal computer.",0

(Excellent): Exactly what we needed for school clases :),0
"(Good for general use but not for online classes): Love this laptop but I will say that if you are a student, a Chromebook may not be the best choice. Especially if you have online classes. Some of the software we have to use for my online classes is not compatible with Chromebook. Only windows or Mac. I ended up having to use my old crappy windows laptop to complete some assignments. So I'm disappointed with that considering I got this computer for school. But it is great for general use. Very fast and easy to use. I love that all my stuff is synced through Google.",0
"(Muy bueno): Llegó muy rápido a Argentina, una semana justa.La computadora está buenísima, en base al precio.Muy potente, muy buen teclado y mouse pad.Construcción buena, es de plástico.La webcam integrada es muy buena comparada con otras del precio, muy buena para video llamadas.Los parlantes suenan muy bien, pero despacio.LA PANTALLA. De frente se ve excelente, tiene pocos ángulos de visión. No es inconveniente pero para que sepan, por el precio está bien. (Es lo más flojo)Primeras impresiones muy buenas",0
"(Excellent product): I purchased this device on a whim, having dealt with MSI's graphics cards when building my own rigs. This comes at a price well worth the specs that are on this portable, powerful product. From benchmark testing this thing for a few on my high demanding games I've got to say it comes up to snuff. The thing does get loud when you run it through its paces but that's what you get when you've got a high end graphics card in the thing. It won't give you the best graphics settings to most new games but you can run this baby on high without having to worry too much.",0
(Finally a chromebook that lasts!): Our high school boys are required to have a Chromebook for school. I had purchased two of the ASUS Chromebook C202SA-YS02 and it was the worst experience I had ever had with an with an electronic device. Both of the ASUS Chromebooks had to be sent for repair three times! Literally when we got the ASUS Chromebook back form the repair center it would stop working the day we got them back. Right now as we speak one of the ASUS Chromebooks is back at their repair center in Texas and we are awaiting its arrival as my son loses points in class for not having the Chromebook. As for the other ASUS Chromebook they finally gave me my money back after the third repair. I did some research and chose the Samsung Chromebook. Immediately my son was able to see the difference between both brands and it is working like a champion! The journey began in December of 2019 and now we just need to see what is going to happen with the other ASUS as it is now in repair for the 3rd time as well. I am hoping they give me my money back and I can purchase another Samsung Chromebook. You will not be disappointed with Samsung! They are a true contender in the Chromebook game. The aesthetic is top notch and its performance is second to none. Battery life is long and everything about it is perfect! No complains here! Thank you Samsung!,0
"(but adjusted easily. Nice having something smaller and lighter for traveling): thought I was going to have a problem going from a laptop to a chromebook with the size of the keyboard, but adjusted easily. Nice having something smaller and lighter for traveling. Not as much I can do on it, but it is adequate. Wish they could make laptops this light weight. Screen is a bit small for me.",0

(Good price Good PC): The best Laptop,0
(Best 579$ laptop): This Laptop is perfect. I suggest putting a price alert on it because Amazon has flash sales. I bought mine for $579 and couldn't be happier. Does everything I need it to. I must have gotten a good one off the line cuz there is almost 0 backlight bleed. Runs fast. Starts in seconds. You can undervolt to improve thermals but it does a great job with that anyway. No complaints! Just wait till the price drops before you buy it. The sales only last about 20 minutes here and there.Will update in a month with a follow up review.,0
(Excellent chromebooks!): Excellent chromebooks! We purchased 6 of these chromebooks for our organization and they work very well. Battery life is excellent and our students love them!,0
"(Dont waste your money!): Literally the only way you can hear anything is in a dead quiet room, not that great even connected to a Bluetooth speaker. Battery life is a mere 5 hours. Probably the most disappointing laptop I've ever bought.Updated to add that it will randomly have issues turning on.New update: has now become a daily ordeal attempting to get it to actually turn on.",0
(Just what we needed!): Start up was fast. Everything is fast on this laptop. Buy this one! You won't regret it.,0
"(Is not new): Ok,I will start from the part were the Chromebook that I bought IS NOT NEW and on the details said is NEW. I feel very pistoff and bad cuz I was fuelled. I buy a lot from amazon and is the first time that happened to me.Is looking good ,no scratches nothing. We connected at tv (hdmi) and is working perfectly.When we open it we've been asked about a password, somebody else was connected and from there we realize that is not new. The serial number on the manual guide is not the same with the one on the back of the chromebook.Came with the original power cord.We reboot it and is ok.",0
The fans are loud like most laptops. Its so loud it disturbs others in the same room.,0
"(Excellent value!): The Lenovo Flex 6 with 14 inches HD LCD IPS panel with touch screen reviewed here has impressive features that really works well. The best part is the affordability in this crowded convertible PC market. It can also function as “Tablet PC” thanks to its 360 degrees swivel design and with the optional pen; you can get creative with included software. Even without a pen, the touch screen registers simple & multi-touch gestures really well. Once you get accustomed using touch screen, you will see that using this PC becomes very intuitive.In this price range, the Lenovo Flex 6 offers a very well balanced mix of features, which you can find only on premium priced laptops, which I find a major benefit in this new 2018 model. The laptop’s LCD panel is good with high-resolution full HD display and the Yoga-like design makes it possible to use it as a tablet as well as in a tent type for viewing multimedia. The speakers are excellent for a laptop of this size and are ‘Harman Kardon’ branded boasting Dolby Audio premium sound.The display’s bezel (only on three sides) is actually quite thin for a laptop that is quite affordable. Actually looks high-end. Granted there is about 1 inch or thicker bezel at the bottom of the display but I found this larger than normal bottom bezel useful as this prevents your fingers coming in view while you type. The camera is on the top and has a white light to indicate its ON. Lenovo has apps that allow you to disable camera from the taskbar. You could also cover it using a thin black electrical tape! Webcam camera is 720p, which works great with Microsoft Skype.The keyboard has adjustable brightness enabled back-lighting and provides comfortable scalloped type of keys that you tend to find only on high-end laptops. The keyboard also has a row of multimedia keys and provides easy access to volume, display, and host of other functions with minimal effort. The touch-pad is actually very responsive and features multiple gestures compatible with Windows 10. Scrolling effortlessly using two fingers, minimizing to desktop using 3-finger grab all works great.The laptop also has a fingerprint sensor, which is Windows 10 “Hello” capable, which I found very useful. The quality of the laptop is better than expected for the offered price range, it does not feel like cheap plastic and the brushed metal look gives the laptop a high-class look. This is of course little heavy but relatively thin laptop. It weighs in at 3.5 pounds and about 18mm thick.The laptop is very snappy, all the included applications worked right out of the box; there was no hanging, lagging and there were no crashes. The review sample given to me had Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz, with 16GB of DDR4 RAM (SK Hynix HMA82GS6CJR8N-VK); The SSD had a capacity of 256GB, which is a M.2 type model number HFS256GD9TNG-62A0A (SK Hynix.) Granted, it is not the best M.2 “PCIe SSD” currently in the market but in my tests, I found out that the Windows 10 OS boots in under 15 seconds, which I consider plenty, fast enough for a laptop of this price range.The motherboard had a built-in Intel HD VGA (620), which drives the LCD panel, also a GeForce MX130 discrete sitting on PCI Express x4 Gen3 bus, dedicated video memory 2048 MB of GDDR5 type: Realtek 8822BE Wireless LAN 802.11ac PCI-E NIC. Wi-Fi Wireless. You also have Bluetooth 4.1 for file transfers and audio device pairing. The laptop has 'secure boot' enabled, also has a TPM module, which gives Windows 10 the cryptographic operations. This also means it is harder to tamper using malicious software, which is good for you as a customer & the hardware manufacturer (Lenovo) & software provider (Microsoft).PROS:[+] Good build quality, feels sturdy, does not look cheap! Touchpad works great![+] LCD panel is good quality, FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS multi-touch anti-glare and good viewing angles.[+] Battery life is better than average, works for about eight hrs. Also has fast charging options![+] Boots fast under 15 seconds, wakes up fast too. Has fingerprint sensor with Hello compatible![+] All included applications worked right out of the box, No hangs or crashes![+] Tablet PC mode is a plus. You can do creative things using the optional pen.[+] You can double your laptop as a gaming device using XBOX app from Microsoft[+] Has USB-C port, Always ON USB 3.0 port for charging your phone. Has HDMI port, SD card slot.[+] Has a standard 3.5mm audio combo jack perfect for wired headphones & gaming headsetsCONS:[-] Little bit heavy at 3.5 pounds[-] The discrete graphics GeForce MX130 is not compatible with Microsoft mixed Reality (VR)Even with the very few minor CONs listed above, which I have discovered thus far, the laptop is very capable looks good and feels good in hand, It is otherwise fully functional thereby not affecting my overall impression. I however caution you that you need to get the “top-most” model ""81EM000DUS"" or better offered here. Please note that Lenovo makes laptops that are affordable for the masses but please do not get too stingy trying to save additional $200 on the low-end model in the Flex-6 series, please make yourself a favor and get the",0
"(Impressive overall, but there are a few short comings.): For a laptop, this is extremely impressive. The i9 12900H can outperform my previous desktop pretty easily and the RTX 3070 to can handle most 2k gaming without struggling. This laptop comes with performance tuning and RGB adjustment right out of the box. The keyboard is nice, I personally don't like the number pad and had to disable that function because it's just to easily activated, having the number pad to a keybind instead would have been perfect though. Additionally, only16gbs of RAM and 1tb of storage in a $2000+ laptop is kind of underwhelming and 32gbs RAM and a 2tb drive for the OS would have been more ideal, but at least they are fully upgradable with and have an extra m.2 slot available assuming you are willing to open up this thing.I am personally not bothered by the lack of webcam because my phone's camera is more than good enough to use instead.The included power brick isn't very small or light, but don't see how they could easily make it smaller considering the power this machine requires.Only 4 USB connections total is also unfortunate and that's including the tb4 and the displayport capable 3.2 on the back. To make matters worse, there's also no native displayport, so unless your monitor has an HDMI 2.0 port, you won't get full use out of it. The tb4 is very handy though and if you are willing to get a tb4 splitter/hub it can add a lot of the ports that are otherwise absent, but all of the decent ones I have found all are more than $100 dollars and require external power just to operate as far as I know.As far as performance goes though, this thing won't disappoint, the fan noise is also much more reasonable than I expected. Of course it's not going to be quiet under higher loads, but it gets quite reasonable performance even when it's optimized for more quiet operation. I got unlucky and my particular unit unfortunately has some coil wine when under load that is particularly annoying to me, but that's most likely just due to bad luck rather than a problem with every laptop.Quick Edit: The coil wine went away after a few days of running the laptop.I mostly got display port alt mode to function through the USB 3.2 the display is 2k 165hz and it runs at that speed with no added latency (the reason why I say almost is that I can't get the Nvidia control panel to detect the display, but it's there in windows settings).I also upgraded the RAM to a 32Gb kit of Kingston fury 4800mhz cl38, the new RAM makes the laptop even faster in games that are affected by RAM speed I would recommend this upgrade if you can afford it, a Kingston 2tb pcie gen 4 ssd is also on the way.",0

I wanted to future proof myself a bit while also not killing the wallet. The laptop has great screen resolution. I played all my games on ULTRA settings with no issues. The RGB keyboard (i was coming from an old PC) was a nice refreshing upgrade of levity. As stated by many other reviews, the battery life isn't the longest but this fits the bill for me. I wanted something that I would pretty much use at home plugged in and when needed, I could transport a gaming beast without having to lug a tower and monitor etc. Speakers leave more to be desired but honestly, I use a gaming headset and don't even think about it.

"(Abysmal quality and features as compared to previous XPS13 models.): (There are almost 100 different listings on Amazon for this exact same build, and I wished I had read this here, on the listing with the most reviews, so I am posting my review here. This is a review for a Dell XPS 13 9360, but it appears to be the same form factor as the 9370 and 9380)I have owned 2 XPS15 and 2 XPS13 laptops in the past. The build quality on this one falls far short of prior models. They keys are klunky and feels like they can pop off any moment and the touch pad is rubbery instead of smooth. The edges are also sharper and has a rougher finish than older models. Dell has done a terrible job of managing expectations by significantly lowering build quality. There's no HDMI or DP output like in previous models, so you need another $100 dongle for video out, or an additional USB port. The edges are sharp instead of round like on previous models.After 10 months of use, I can add: The touchpad has become smooth, and I've almost gotten used to the flimsy keys. The battery life and Wi-Fi on this laptop is its only saving grace. 8GB of RAM that can't be upgraded, is a deal breaker for anyone who needs more 3 or so tabs open in a browser. I run Ubuntu, and constantly have to invoke the OOM-killer (Alt+PrtScr+F) to unfreeze my desktop. We seem to have finally managed to fix the Linux i915 graphics driver - which crashed after 1-2 days of uptime.",0
"(Awesome Chromebook; Inconsistent Models): I've been using a chromebook as my primary computer for well over 5 years. The last one I used was an Acer c720 with an i3 processor, I loved that thing.... I replaced the battery and it still works great but this deal was too good to pass up. $450 for a 7th generation m3 processor convertible chromebook with a dedicated stylus is a great deal. Considering google is offering free note taking apps on the offers page also sweetens the deal. In my opinion, this computer is a significantly better value than anything you'd get from a windows computer in this price range.I initially ordered this when it was priced $495 and a 3rd party retailer sent me an xe521qab (dark grey) instead of the listed xe520qab (light grey). I'm going to compare both units at the end.I'm starting with reviewing the specs and hardware since I think mentioning overall build quality is important and why I chose this unit over others. I'm also going to compare both models since everyone needs to know what they're buying before they actually buy it. I'm also going to touch briefly on the capabilities of Chrome OS and its limitations so first time buyers have an idea what they're getting.Pros:- Convertible, able to run Android apps- Included stylus built into the computer- Fast, low power CPU (fanless computer)- Full HD screen (1920 x 1200 resolution)- Great battery life- Audio is great, just quiet- Linux apps available from within ChromeOS- Keyboard has good travel, very comfortable to type- Trackpad is a good size and is responsiveCons:- No backlit keyboard (some chromebooks in this price range have them)- Can't install any kind of Windows or Mac programs- Will not be able to play computer games, but it can play mobile games from androidProcessor:The processor in this unit is an intel core m3-7y30. To me, this is one of the best processors you can ask for in a Chromebook, but can be underpowered in a Windows laptop. The two specs I feel are most important are 4.5 W TDP and 1.0 ghz - 2.6 ghz clock speed.In layman's terms, this processor has extremely low power requirements which sips power and is able to increase its clock speed high enough to get tasks done. This chip can also hyperthread, basically making it more efficient per core and increasing speed as well. Because of this low power state, the processor doesn't heat up too much and the computer doesn't need a fan. The computer makes no noise. I've noticed zero lag at all, even using the stylus. This thing is overpowered for most tasks Chrome OS needs. It's a great balance between power needed vs maximizing battery life.To give you an idea on price, this processor's MSRP is $280. Kind of already covers half of the price of the computer already.Screen:Incredible considering the wide viewing angles, I can see the screen from every angle possible. My old Acer c720 has the worst screen imaginable with a very narrow, low resolution display. This thing is just as nice as a ""retina"" display in any macbook.Battery:As stated earlier, the M3 processor doesn't use much power compared to other processors, the lack of a fan also saves a lot of power.running a crosh battery test, the rate of decline without running anything is about 1% in 300 seconds, or about 12% an hour. So I would say best case scenario, 8 - 8.3 hours of battery life. This is good, not the best, but certainly good enough for me. I got 3 days of solid use before I needed a new charge. In comparison, my acer c720 sipped about 1.25% every 300 seconds, or had around 6.7 hours of battery life. It is older and the CPU's are different, but overall it's significantly better.Audio:Great for a laptop. Audio has good dynamic range, just no bass. These are solid speakers and it feels premium, just not nearly as premium as a macbook for instance.Chrome OS:When you buy a Chromebook, you should primarily be using it for web browsing and simple tasks. If you're tied into google's ecosystem it can do much more. On the other hand, if you're tied into Apple's ecosystem it can be a challenge to use.Chrome OS can't run computer programs built for Windows or Mac, such as microsoft office and photoshop. You can use an online suite of office or the android apps, but they aren’t the same. Setting up a wired printer can be confusing. Downloading word documents may change the way they look when opened with google docs. Conversely, saving things from google docs to word format may also mess up the formatting, issues I wish would get polished out in the future.Overall, I think chromebooks are absolutely ready for widespread use. Chrome OS is much more secure than both Windows and Mac's, the fact that you hardly ever download anything keeps the computer fast and secure. The lightweight OS absolutely flies, for everyday tasks it's much faster than Windows or OS X and you'll notice a difference right away.Linux Programs:Back in the day (6 years ago), you had to sideload a linux OS in order to use linux apps. It worked but was clunky and made it much harder to keep linux up to date. Plus it took up valuable space on the chromebook and you had to switch OS' completely in order to use them.Today, ChromeOS has a linux virtual machine built into it, and you're able to pull apps from the linux database directly into ChromeOS and run apps. This is absolutely amazing to me, and I'm not sure when google decided to do this, but it basically makes ChromeOS a near complete machine with much lower limitations. This gives you access to good program alternatives to photoshop and microsoft office, especially if you need something that does a little bit more than what google apps can do. This is by no means as nice or complete as Windows or Mac as it still requires knowledge to do it properly and keep it up to date, but it's free and open source, and I think it's important to support that idea. Linux and Android are the two most popular open source platforms, there's a lot of things you can do with both of them and it's great having both available within Chrome OS.Tablet:This is where ChromeOS is heading towards, so I wouldn't recommend getting a chromebook that isn't convertible at this point. It's nice to have and makes it able to run android apps.Apps that would be useful on a chromebook would be anything that can take notes and take advantage of a stylus. It's good for annotating powerpoints, drawing, or taking school notes if you enjoy writing over typing. Everything else is just gimmicky, but It's still amazing to have an ability to flip the thing around and have a high resolution tablet available.xe520qab vs xe521qab:When I purchased this chromebook, a manufacturer sent me the 521 by mistake, so to get the lower price I had to return it and get the 520. Amazon unfortunately wasn't able to price match. I took pictures so everyone can see the difference.The 521 is simply nicer. It has a darker body, metal keyboard deck, smooth edges; it just feels much better and more expensive. It's rounder in most places, tablet mode feels smoother and better when holding it. The only two thing I like about the 520 is how it looks when it's closed and it feels better when opening it. The sharp edges are nice and clean, but the plastic keyboard deck just isn’t as comfortable.If you can find the xe521qab for the same price as the xe520qab, I'd pick the 521 in a heartbeat. Other than that you're getting the exact same thing. Both are fantastic computers and I'm sure anybody would be happier with either pick.$450 is an absolute steal for either of these computers.",0

"(Doesn't have a flash drive port): We bought this laptop for our church, for teaching hybrid classes. We assumed it would have a flash drive port, and that was important because our teachers bring their lessons on a flash drive. We had to return this item, which was complicated because it came from a third party vendor. We returned it to Amazon immediately, but months later they sent it back to us saying that they cannot accept the return. We had to figure out how to return it to a third party vendor. Not impossible, and the vendor has been helpful, but it sure was more complicated than I had hoped.",0
"(A beautiful computer, totally worth the money!): Ok, first off, I'm gonna admit to the fact that I don't have much knowledge for computers. But I know enough to know the basics, like the processors, SSD, and stuff. Not gonna lie, I'm glad I went with MSI on my transition from being a Macbook user to joining the Windows family. I'm glad I snagged this computer at the perfect time, because I saved $200. It's probably one of the best deals I've seen- for a gaming computer, especially. The specs are amazing- the computer runs so fast, and not to mention the heap amount of storage you get for the price! Probably will be a computer I hold onto for a long time.I totally recommend this computer, get it before it loses the discount!",0

(Pleased so far): Only think I like better on my older Lenovo is that the caps lock and number lock keys light up. I have had an occasional problem with the number pad not working even with lock on in this Sager but otherwise I am pleased with the laptop. I have actually not had time to try it out in a game yet. I have not found anything wrong with it unlike a Dell I bought and immediately returned. This is my 2nd sager and the older one still works great just is outdated. Sager and Lenovo are the only brands that work good for me right out of the box.,0

"(Perfect for our teen): Want a laptop that has full connectivity, speed, and works very well for schoolwork? Choose this one. As more teachers move to document sharing it makes sense to have something like this for your teen to use. The overall durability is a bit suspect but with the price tag, it is essentially a 1-2 year investment for school. Chromebooks are extremely light, easy to type on and come with complete integration into Google cloud services like drive, docs and spreadsheets. You will not be gaming hard on this laptop or installing anything locally if you can help it because it's best served as a cloud only device. If your looking for windows, gaming (instead of app games like your phone) and local storage I would look elsewhere.Make sure to get the versions with at least 4gb of ram, it does make a difference for multi-tasking.",0

"(The laptop arrived with a crack case): We bought this computer to replace one that was ""irredeemable"". It has an i5 Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3. I am not sure why the speed has increased, but we like it a whole lot better. The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on 24 hours a day. This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it. The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters----we do not search the web or receive e-mails. The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support. We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year. (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft ""updated"" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working. I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they ""updated"" my computer, and asked if they would fix it. They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge. At that point I was loud and angry. I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware. ""You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"". I said I would not pay such ransom ware money. I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one. I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing. They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"". I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.) An update to my review: the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker. I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge. No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------A further update on my refund----------The seller (Tech Deals Store) is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack. I have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer. If I don't receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund. If that doesn't work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company. ( I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam.) Further update---- Amazon gave me the $77.70 back. I hope I remember the name ""Tech Deals Store"" and never buy from these people again.",0
"(Slowing down): Upgraded from my 2014 MacbookAir b/c it was slowing down. This 2020 MacbookAir started out great, but within 3 weeks it's slowing down too! Display is more or less fine.

"(Good for gaming): Overall impression its a great mid range laptop for the money. Highly recommend that you upgrade to 32G of ram first and foremost. Secondly I added a 2tb Samsung SSD along with another 2TB Samsung M.2 Drive. Laptop has connectors for the additional ssd slot along with one open m.2 slot. The laptop comes with 16g ( 2 x 8 ) so I ended up buying 2 x 16 crucial 3200 for a easy going price. Great PC, make sure you get yourself a cooling pad and you won't need to worry. Great build, CPU GPU.",0

"(Underpowered Bay Trail processor): I just bought one of these (the 4GB full HD model). I was very disappointed after running the Octane performance test a few times. This HP gets around 8,500. My much cheaper and much older 2GB Acer C720 Chromebook with a Haswell Celeron kicks it's butt with scores around 13,500. These HP Chromebooks have the ""Bay Trail"" version of the Celeron. Don't be fooled. Not all Celerons are created equal. The Bay Trail is an under-powered tablet-style chip. The HP Chromebook 14 is a fan-less design, because the Bay Trail does run cooler than the regular laptop chips. So it's silent. But you trade a lot of performance to get that.Update: I just decided to return this. While I initially felt the build quality was pretty good, I encountered two problems... 1) After switching to a dark wallpaper, I noticed a definite ""screen bleed"" in one of the corners where the backlight was leaking. 2) The battery drained almost entirely dead while the lid was closed overnight. I am under the impression that the thing should be asleep and not consuming power when the screen is closed.",0
"(This Chromebook is awesome. When firing it up you literally just log ...): This Chromebook is awesome. When firing it up you literally just log into your g-mail account. The build quality is nice, it is light weight with a large screen and it is excellent to have a full keyboard. Keep in mind with Chromebooks it is all web based so you don't have the full operating system slowing down the speed like a traditional laptop. Also HP has a similar model with 2 gbs of memory but for $30 more you can double it, such a great deal!",0
"(It's great, but the space bar squeaks something fierce.): I think the entire computer is exactly what I needed it for, which is primarily running Clip Studio Paint, Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro. It runs all of those programs and more very well! The only issue is that I'm losing my mind over this space bar squeaking. It's constant and grating. Wish it didn't squeak only a couple months into buying, but overall a good product.",0
"(Best laptop for the money): I was looking to upgrade from my 2 yr old LG gram to something with more power for solidworks. This model seemed to fit the bill and had that Microsoft Surface look to it.First thing I did upon receiving the laptop was a windows reset and then I popped in 64 gb of ram. Removal of the back cover was quite easy to do and the memory was easy to access.Then i removed most of the microsoft bloat (using Tron) and uninstalled most of the MSI programs. The Laptop was fast but still had some minor hiccups like my bluetooth disappearing until i rebooted the laptop. So i decided to create a USB image of win 10 and then reformat and reinstall everything from scratch. Once I re-installed only the essential MSI utility programs and drivers.Laptop gets about 8 hours of battery use with surfing the web and office programs. With solidworks and PCNB CAD apps it gets about 5-6 hours. There are still some issues with the Creator program that controls the laptop such as apps that don't switch over to integrated as they should even though you specify them to, but other than that this is a smoking deal.Running on super battery setting with the nvidia GPU not active seems to be getting about 12 hours of battery after the clean install.",0
"(No longer works): So I bought this laptop just for browsing the internet, and writing. A couple of weeks ago, it became painfully slow to the point it is now unusable. I don't store files on it, I have not downloaded anything to it, and I have run everybscannI could think of. No virus or malware has been found. It was after an update, and since that update it is not usable. There is no help from Acer either. Do not buy this laptop!",0

(Love it !!): I am impressed. Perfect work and business laptop. Fast. Beautiful screen. Love the neat font. The windows layout is way better than dell or hp. You do get 1 month free for windows office- but I ended up purchasing the year. Works beautifully for my tasks. I had multiple apps and windows running while listening to music and I was still very productive. Only thing is the battery is only 5hrs and speakers aren’t really loud like I’d like but besides that I still give it 5 stars.,0
"(Very powerful and capable budget gaming laptop): This laptop is a fantastic budget gaming laptop. The SSD boots right up very quick load times, the GTX card is very capable for almost all gaming needs. I have been playing COD Warzone and it runs extremely smooth, the fans do get loud and after a while they REALLY start pushing hot air out the side to where you can feel it on your mouse hand if youre close enough, I think this is a good indicator of how well its cooling. The one issue that lots of reviewers mentioned and its very true, is that the battery life is abysmal, I can play COD for about an hour unplugged, even just sitting there on the homescreen it will only last maybe 3 hours. i get it with all these powerful features it does use a lot of power, but if you think youll have enough battery for a 4 hour flight this isnt it. BUT with how incredibly well it runs my games, i can forgive it i still give it 5 stars even with the terrible battery life because this is clearly a gaming laptop and it doesnt pretend to be anything else. The custom LED lighting for the keyboard is pretty slick, you can give it different light profiles for different games. The monitor is really impressive for a laptop, even high movement gaming looks fantastic with no perceptible lag. The wireless card is very fast i get about 85-90% wired speeds even with a few walls between the router. Overall im very impressed and I absolutely recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a great gaming rig. Also, its upgradable, it comes with a hard drive expansion kit, and everything can be taken out and upgraded for future proofing.",0
"(2022 Model: major upgrade on specs): This is for the 2022 model which has some serious upgrades on specs from the earlier model. First, you are dealing with a 10 core chip, and not the underpowered 4 core i7, so that is substantial. This was always a weak link in the prior version. You are also dealing with 16gb ddr 5 (not 4) ram, so that is both more and faster but note that upgrading ddr5 ram will be more expensive than upgrading a ddr4 machine so you may have to wait for ram prices to fall a bit before upgrading.THERE IS A VIDEO CAMERA!! The old version did not have it. Is it a great camera? No, but it will work fine for zooms. The hard drive is on teh small side at 500G but these are easy to upgrade (a 1 TB costs about 100 bucks and is easy to install).The looks are clean and efficient without looking to ""gaming"" but the charging brick is still a brick which effects some portability. But in all, by spec, this is a solid gaming machine.",0

Was forced to pay $80 and send it to them - documented exactly the way how to reproduce the issue, put the instructions in the package alongside laptop and also asked the technician to document in the case. Got the laptop back as ""fixed"" while inside found ""could not reproduce"" in the report status. How can this be? I repeated dozen times how exactly to reproduce and got back the same broken laptop. Called support again and got the same suggestion - send it to us to fix...

THIS IS A TOUCHSCREEN CHROMEBOOK, yes I tested it and the touchscreen works every time I've tried it. The only downside I would point out is that the screen is a bit on the weak side, it has a limited viewing angle, have to be right in front of it, off to the side a bit and it'll be hard to use or view. Only other thing to mention is if you want to hook it up to a monitor or TV you'll need to get a USB-C adapter like a USB-C to HDMI adapter or cord, it doesn't come with a video out port like HDMI.",0

The only complaint I have is the trackpoint cap was missing and I had to buy a replacement. All in all it is a good value for the money. It is an older laptop and is a little thicker and heavier than the newer models,0
(Ease of use): It was very easy for my family to use.,0
(POOR AUDIO :(): Trying to contact seller as the audio jack is not working. This completely defeats the usefulness of this computer when the audio isn't reliable and using earbuds or headset doesn't work. The laptop has been set up on a desk and not carried around (though it should be able to be moved around) and now the audio is finicky and the audio jack doesn't work at all. :( It's only been used for a few months!,0
"(Purchase of Second ASUS Power Adapter at Amazon Is a Mess): I recently purchased this ASUS Zenbook, and the laptop itself is great. Because I use it in two locations and the adapter is very large and bulky, I need to have a second power adapter. Well, I have been astonished at how frustrating it is to buy one. I looked up the part number (A17-150 P1a) and searched for it at Amazon. I placed my order for the JUYOON 150W adapter that Amazon displayed for this part number. When the adapter arrived, I found that its DC Plug was too big for the hole in my laptop!So be careful because ordering the right ASUS part number on Amazon does not mean that you are going to get the right part!! If I had known that ASUS and its suppliers have more than one adapter with the same part number, I would have measured the DC Plug carefully before I placed my order at Amazon.I then decided to remove the uncertainty at Amazon and find the adapter on the ASUS website. This was frustrating because there was no information there on the right power supply for this laptop. And there was no match for the part number at all. The adapters there were listed by wattage and not by part number. I then tried chatting with their support person, and found that she couldn't help me at all. Not her fault, but shows a poor process for post-sales purchases. She told me to call some phone number during normal working hours and speak to someone who knew the information about what ASUS power adapter went with each ASUS laptop.So be warned about ASUS post-sales accessories. It's very tricky!",0
"(no backlit keys, returned it - TWICE): After going thru entire setup, determined there was nothing behind the so called key to turn on the backlight. Tried everything short of getting the big hammer out so I’ve returned it. However I did like what I had seen so far and for the price, thought I’d give them other chance before hitting a big box store. Fingers crossed my next one arrives in 4 days.EDIT: This seller apparently doesn’t know how to send you the correct laptop. Twice now I have received a laptop that does not have a backlit keyboard. Reducing to one star.To anyone who isn’t sure, if your F7 key does not have the little symbol of a keyboard on it, you have been given the wrong laptop, as there is not backlighting on your keyboard. Seller: Please check your merchandise and your orders carefully. I don’t see why it should be so difficult to send your customers the product you are explicitly advertising.",0
"(Love it, although I am not a fan of ...): Love it, although I am not a fan of Windows 10. Also it comes with Microsoft Edge and the default browser and I hate Edge. I have to figure out how to make Outlook my default. Other than that, the laptop works great. No issues.",0
"(Still have some issues.): Okay, up front, the entire system is slow to boot up; slow in operation; nothing but one constant stream of headaches upon another: I have had it for nearly two months, and have taken it to computer repair store twice, just to see if they could find the trouble of why it constantly locks up.Even Windows 10 being reinstalled three times failed to correct the current long list of issues:never again will I purchase a refurbished computer.",0
"(Great computer!!!): This computer was recommended to me by an IT guy haha. I was babysitting his kid and casually was talking about gaming computers and he said this one was great for gaming on a budget. So far, it cools fast and easy, the graphics card is AMAZING for this price, the free headset offer is really great, and I love the light up keyboard for when I’m burning the midnight oil. It’s also excellent at running games and I’ve had no problems or lag. Thank you MSI!!!",0
(Five Stars): This product has worked quite fine and i would recommend it to others.,0
(Died four months after buying.): Died four months after buying.,0
(So far so good): So far it's been great I haven't had any problems with it I know I have seen some bad reviews on it so I guess I will update this if I have any The only thing that wasn't great was the battery life that is why I gave it 4 stars,0
"(Excellent battery, smooth performance, great laptop!): I've only had this a week, but it's been a great week. I've used this laptop for writing reports, email, web browsing, minor photo editing, and wordpress development. It's worked perfectly for all of those tasks, with no slowdown that I've noticed at any time. Battery life is excellent, with around 10 hours of actual use, and very good standby battery life.The only issues I've had are 1) keyboard - the keys are just a bit . . . different. Sometimes I think that I hit a key, but it doesn't register. This mostly happens when I'm typing longer emails or I'm not paying as much attention. If I focus on my typing, it's not an issue. 2) Fan - the CPU fan comes on even during low intensity tasks like web browsing. It's not very loud, but it is noticeable. I wish it were quieter, but it's really not a big deal. For how smooth everything runs, I gladly take the fan noise. And 3) the left USB port doesn't work with my wireless mouse. The right USB port works, and the left USB port works with everything else I've tried, including a USB hub and a thumb drive. Not sure what the issue is there, but I just use the right port.I would definitely buy it again, and I think it's a great device for the price.",0
"(Works As Expected): Nice laptop, works as expected. It forgets the internet easily, if you leave your location and come back- so keep your eye out for that. Other than that there is not much to complain about.",0
"(Fast, and reasonably priced): The specifications of this laptop are very well considered. There is enough memory, enough SSD space, and a big, bright glorious screen. The power supply is rather large, but is thin for easier packing. The only downside I can see is runtime when it is not powered and is running just on battery is limited, but if you will be leaving it plugged in most of the time, this shouldn’t be an issue. The keyboard is nice, too, and is full-sized, which is rare on a laptop. Recommended.",0
"(Update- He got a PRO): Update- 6/11/18He bought an Ipad Pro. The one with the sketchbook at Costco for $700.Main reason, bad battery life with this Lenovo. The 5-6 hours he got testing it in original review was not continuous use.He needed a sketch device for work, on a job site, with no outlet access, and he could not get through a day of plans.It's a shame bc he does miss the ruler on the Lenovo.So I tested it today, as I am tech support in our house.Just did everyday web browsing. Work stuff, news, Bored Panda, and of course, Amazon.He's right. Here's the results.415pm- 100 %520pm-50%602pm- low battery warning at 25%620pm- 11%. I plugged it in.Nothing has been added to the device. It's just as it came out of the box.No apps as the MSN App store has nothing he uses.Also, the screen is not nearly as bright unplugged.Didn't notice until I plugged it back in to charge, which usually means a battery saver is on.But just over 2 hours of use unplugged, in 2018.. well, not very good, is it?If you just want a compact laptop & have electrical access, this has great sketch features.I load my photo & drawing software and see how it fares with those options.But for this price point, sad battery & limited App store, makes it's just ok so, 3 stars. Sorry.Original Review~Everything about this Lenovo is Five Stars, maybe even 6 but... The App Store is MSN which is unequipped with basic apps like MLB.There is a Lenovo App Store which had MLB & gave me hope but, it rolled over to MSN.I will make a tech support call by EOW & if I have success, will update but that is the only reason for 4 stars bc this is a stellar device.This was for him, who travels for work & lost his Ipad so we've been shopping replacement.A new one was on the to do list as he wanted a sketchbook & the Pro was a pricy top contender.The Lenovo Flex excels in so many areas. It's not much thicker than an iPad.The screen quality, definition & color are mind blowing. Better than our fairy new tv.The sound is crystal clear.He's an audiophile, as I think anyone who has played music is, and thought the tunes streaming off YouTube were the stereo.The main need was the sketchbook.He's a carpenter and the ability to sketch out builds, installs & have a 3D bid is priceless.The ability to share, save & copy is seamless with icons on sketch screen.The music note icon in the right corner by the Wi-Fi symbol , instantly gives you access to a blank sketch page, photo sketch & digital post-its.It has a ruler AND a protractor, both adjustable to desired size, plus highlighter & 18 different ink colors & sliding thickness.The ruler moves 360° and slides anywhere on the page with just your fingers. I know the stylus is optional but so far have not found a use for it with this incredibly responsive touch screen.The moment you flip the screen over, an icon pops up to give you option to go into 'Tablet mode'. I like options so, I like that the screen is always touchscreen responsive while having full access to a keyboard.On battery life, it sat for a couple days after a full charge & he was able to use it for 5-6 hours before it hit 20%.It was back at a 100% after just over an hour.I think the quick charge option may have kicked in bc it was at 50% after maybe 20 min.The only downside for him, as he travels is, I haven't found any type of Otterbox protection for screen or device in case it drops but, that's a factor of going with a Flex vs a tablet.Also, Apps work better on the road vs sketchy WiFi so the afore mentioned lacking App Store not having any of his staples is a challenge but that's just our personal experience.If you're looking for a creative, crossover device that will fill a multitude of options from business to pleasure, Lenovo made a believer out of my Apple loyalist.",0
"(A Great laptop for the price with a minnor issue): A great laptop for that price.. it is one of the best deals you can find atm.It can run any games at max quality w/o issues, screen is nice, keyboard is solid, the only thing that is kinda weird are the speakers, i've tried a lot of different configs and they don't sound that good. Anyway it is a great laptop that you won't regret spending your money.",0
(Mossing stuff and not working): Nice looking screen I have had it for a week maybe and I am upset for the 5th time I my cursor goes missing it freezes and I cant open up more than 2 apps I'm pissed and I've tried contacting the customer service and it did not come with a bookletUpdated 2/21 SCREEN STILL OUT AND NEVERRRRR GOT A CALL BACK THIS REALLY WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY I WISH I COULD GIVE IT 0 STARS CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS BAD DO NOT BUY THIS WASTE OF MONEY,0
"(Great all around laptop that's perfect for games as well): This laptop isn't just a great laptop, it's a great desktop replacement. The CPU and GPU will get very hot. Turn off CPU boost, set the max CPU to 95%, put it in balanced mode, and get a laptop cooling mat with fan and it will perform just as good as all setting on. It's maybe a 5% difference but it isn't worth the extra heat and fan noise. It has an open slot for a 1TB SSD which takes about 10 minutes to install. I don't use it without being plugged in, so battery life is not much of an issue. But it's nice to know I can take it with me if I need it when on a business trip. This will play any game thrown at it if you're in the mood. Overall, I've very pleased with this purchase. Hard to beat a i7 with RTX 2070 for the price.",0
"(0ne major drawback. Does not have 1080 HD.): If all you need is a basic computer and are not a gamer, this one offers great value. Fast, efficient, quick battery charge.",0
"(Educational value.): My grandson loves it, uses it for homework and games.",0
(It comes off as Cheap.): Poor build quality. It just comes off as disposable....like diapers. The keyboard back light didn't work. It is a cheap computer...it is what it is.,0
"(Great!): Love this chrome book - perfect for everyday stuff like browsing web and general home computing activities. My first chrome book and can’t believe I never had one before, like much better than my laptop, and fraction of the cost.",0
(Decent): Bought it for my son. He likes it,0
(Es lo que esperaba): Este genial para Autocad y programas de diseño lo único que flaquea es la ram pero tiene un espacio para agregar otra ram así que le puedes pone más ramY para el gaming no creo que sea lo ideal pero si sirve suena mucho y tienes que jugar en en calidades bajas a buenos fpssi no quieres que tú compu quiera despegar cuál avión. Yo la veo como más inversión para diseño y rendersDespués de más de un año de uso se descompuso el controlador de wifi y eso es por el controlador que trae que es muy defectuoso pero si lo quieres arreglar compra un adaptador de red USB y ya,0
"(You won’t find anything else better at this price): Oh man, this MSI Nvidia 3070 Gaming Laptop is exhilarating. I have the capability to run Ultra graphics/ RTX graphics and 144hz. The storage is a bit small for my liking, I plan to soon upgrade my storage and RAM capacity. The CPU, Core i7 11th Gen, is a beast. I purchased the “Used “Like New,” so I obtained this at an affordable price ($1.2k). 2weeks in, I am experiencing no issues. Win 10 can easily be changed to Win 11 for free. The MSI Center application is very resourceful, that’s where you can change the keyboard color and configure/monitor other goodie’s.Overall, if you’re looking for a gaming laptop that’s very powerful and has a decent price tag, I 100% recommended this rig.",0
"(Died): It worked okay for the first week or so, although the keys backlight didn't work.Then it went completely dead. It was no more. Stone dead. Joined the bleedin' choir invisible. It was an ex-parrot.",0
The screen quality is pretty good,0
"(Legion 5): Tras casi dos meses de usarla, a resultado ser muy buena. Para estudios es muy buena, la SSD es muy rapida y para juegos es buenisima. el Build quality es muy bueno, no se siente que sea un plastico barato y es mas da un feeling premium.",0
(Malfunctioning laptop): The laptop came malfunctioning. When I started the laptop a message appeared informing that the system as detected that a cooling fan is not operating correctly.,0
the anodized brushed aluminum case is a bit of a fingerprint magnet.,0
(ASUS VIVOBOOK): VERY NICE SMALL AND LIGHTWEIGHT FOR USE IN MY SEWING ROOM. i DO NOT KNOW ABOUT BATTERY LIFE YET.,0
(DO NOT BUY): I bought 3 of these for my kids for this last Christmas 2020. As of April 2 of the 3 quit working. When trying to turn the 900$ broken laptops on it was “no bootable device”.EXTREMELY UPSET KIDS-UNABLE TO DO HOMEWORK AND PLAY GAMES!EXTREMELY UPSET PARENTS-WHAT A WASTE OF OUR MONEY!!!!!,0
(Lo justo por lo que pagas!!): Muy Buen producto l,0
I'm constantly getting disconnected from wifi and when I am connected it's very slow.,0
(This was a great deal - looked and felt new): I got this for my son who needed a faster computer. It's got a nice i5 processor at a decent clock speed and solid graphics (no discreet card). But he is very happy with the performance. On the one we received the hard drive did crash outside the warranty period - I replaced it with a $50 SSD drive and now the laptop is faster than ever. Aside from the packaging - I could not tell that this was not a brand new computer - no scratches or dents or dead pixels. The battery was able to hold 100% charge. If you're looking fro a laptop for basic gaming and schoolwork - you cannot beat the price and performance of this one.,0
"(pretty good, fast delivery!!): i truly like. did have one issue when starting to downloads origin for Sims but i found a forum from EA and fixed itIt should’ve already been installed and up to date as a gamer pc however, it was used and i think cleared so anyway, it was easy to fix once i researched",0
"(Amazing setup): Very nice setup for gaming , I can play almost any game on high definition 100+fps the turbo mode helps it stay cool and works like a charm, thanks amazon and predator!",0
(Nice Laptop): Perfect Laptop,0
"(Great Web Browsing Machine): I needed a simple machine for wimple web browsing, nothing more. This one fills the bill. I'm sure it can do much more, but it does exactly what I need it to do, and the price was right. If you need a simple machine for simple tasks, this is a great choice. Keep in mind, it doesn't run Windows based applications. It also doesn't insist on doing updates everytime you want to get some work done :-)",0
(Chrome book): I will not be buying a chrome book again! I've had this for about two years and got a notice it is no longer being supported.,0
"(Negligent product by asus, no instruction booklet comes with this product): This laptop is great for its size and lightweight but the capability is just utterly terrible. Came with no instruction book had to go through loopholes to get it out of windows 10 s onto windows 10. Tried to reset the laptop back to factory settings so many times and it just stops at 35% and gives me a screen telling me that there has been a problem with the reset. WOuld not purchase again.",0
"(Cheap Chromebook with limitations): The price is great. The screen contrast is not very good and can be difficult to see from some angles. Turning up the brightness only makes it worse. With Adobe ending flash it has made using school applications and web applications painful to use, sometimes unusable, and webcam difficult. I bought this for my kids to use for online school tasks and they have had problems because of the flash limitations. Only a single USB port.....come on guys....this Cbook doesn't have touchscreen so having only a single USB port is very limiting. It hooks up to both standard WiFi and 5G without issue. My background is with PCs and I am not a fan of the scrolling on this laptop given that it does not have a touchscreen. Hooking up a USB mouse nearly a requirement.",0
"(is this touchscreen?): it works as it should,, didnt know it have touchscreen capabilities",0
it was not consistently fast,0
The price for performance here is great.,0
"(Great value): great for surfing the web, doing homework, and similar tasks. Certainly not a gaming PC, but definitely a good buy if used properly",0
"(it plays games fine but don't expect super high end gaming.): the only problem I have had with this laptop is it came with a corrupt OS. it would crash randomly every time I tried to play a game. it wasn't consistent either. there was no warning, it wouldn't lag or get super choppy or anything. it would just abruptly crash. luckily a buddy of mine had another copy of windows. so I reinstalled the OS. since then I have not had any issues with this laptop. it does what I want it to do playing games. just DON'T EXPECT SUPER HIGH END GAMING such as VR and 4k. other than that I love it and am happy with it. it plays games fine (fortnite, borderlands 2, blacklight retribution, left for dead 2, League of legends). also one other thing; you might also wanna go ahead and get a cooling pad with this. the fans in my laptop go on full blast whenever I start gaming. it doesn't really hinder the experience but just to ease things get one.",0

(Two dead machines in a row ?): This is terrible . Ordered and was dead out of box. New replacement is also not working ! How does this happen twice ??,0
(Don't buy!!!): Bought this chromebook to take on an extended trip. The screen is OK. The volume is OK. The battery life is great (9 hours)What I don't like is the hassel of trying to type as all of a sudden the cursor flies off to some other part of the script and thus types in between previously written text. Other times for no apparent reason it will deleat everything you just wrote. With just this short review it has happened four times. I would return this thing if i were not in India for the year. Don't buy.,0
(So far I love the Chromebook): So far I love the Chromebook. It is so lightweight. Packing my laptop through airports etc is not fun. I bought this for use when doing genealogy research. I am planning a trip in May which will include going to cemeteries. With this Chromebook and my phone as a hotspot I can logon to my ancestry account right in the cemetery. I think this is going to work!,0
The battery goes pretty quickly,0
"(Laptop Gamer): Excelente Laptop, Hermosa, con un gran nivel de performance, muy versatil, excelente para trabajar y para jugar. Encantando con el producto.",0
"(Beast gaming laptop): This laptop is an absolute beast for gaming, the rtx 2070 paired with the i7-10750h destroys any game I throw at it, and at a reasonably higher margin than the screen refresh rate. It can run most games on max settings with an average of high 200fps range. The screen is absolutely more than what I was expecting as well, I had many people tell me not to expect much from a laptop screen, but this 144hz 3ms IPS panel is no joke. I have only 2 small complaints about this laptop. One being the fans get a little loud when they ramp up during gaming, but this isn't a big deal for me or most people I would imagine, because if you're using this laptop for gaming as it's intended, you'll likely have headphones on listening to gameplay and or friends chat. Second the battery life is, to be honest, horrible. Even when everything is switched to power saving mode and i'm at 100% battery I only get about 2-3 hours of life when doing even minimal tasks like web browsing or watching youtube/streams. But as I bought this laptop primarily for gaming that's not a deal breaker for me, as I have it plugged it almost all the time. As I said before, these are not deal breakers for me, only small complaints to take note of,.Overall this laptop still deserves 4 stars, I would give it 5 stars in a heartbeat if it weren't for the battery life.",0
(Flagship usually the best the company has to offer): This computer has a low resolution screen. Flagship usually the best the company has to offer. This is not a flagship. Stop misrepresenting these computers!,0
"(Perfect basic laptop): This laptop is perfect for many if not most people's needs. Surfing various websites, online banking, homework, etc. You can stream videos/movies but the graphics/display isnt top notch. It isnt 'bad' its just average.I like that it is a Dell - I sometimes hesitate buying no name products for something this important.",0
(One Star): I got one and it doesnt have fingerprint sensor and you should check what screen is included. Powerful laptop!,0
"(Five Stars): Granddaughter uses it for school, she loves it!",0
"(super fast): This laptop is a rocket ship, fast boot time and does not appear to be loaded with a lot of bloatware (at least a lot less than others I have seen). I have not used it with only the battery and have not needed the camera yet so I did not rate those.",0
(Great Buy):,0

The customizable body color or design of this device lets me choose a style that best suits my personal preferences. It's a great way to make the device truly my own.,1
(Plays all the games I want!): Does everything I want to do with ease. Runs games like a champ and the fan isn't too loud. I do wish the screen were better though.,0
"(No facial recognition software): This laptop is probably just fine for someone else, but I returned it for a full refund due to the lack of facial recognition software and a keyboard without backlighting. Facial recognition is a great way to unlock a laptop, and can also be used in place of a password for many websites. My condo is usually dimly lit and a keyboard that lights up makes a huge difference. It was a mistake to order this laptop.",0
(Very slow laptop): This is a great value for the money but it’s very slow once it is programmed. I didn’t add any programs and just 2 apps and it ran super slow. I wanted a windows laptop to work from home but won’t be able to do that with this laptop as slow as it runs.,0
"(Great Machine): Very light, with good battery life. Screen is excellent.",0
"(No bootable device error within 4 months. No support.): Bought June 10th. Less than 4 months later no bootable device error. Reached out to seller.

"(The 128GB M.2 is not upgradeable to larger SSD because the HDD cable/adapter is not available): It's a decent budget laptop but I've only used it for a few days. My big disappointment is that the hard drive cable (part # L23187-001) is not currently available so I don't see a way to upgrade the M.2 to a higher-capacity ""regular"" and more affordable SSD.",0

"(Great computer): I got this on a black Friday sale and I feel it was a steal, the specs for the price are amazing all my games run perfect, no complains. Great pc.",0
"(Look NO FURTHER): I absolutely love this laptop. Waited a good couple months to review it. I agonized over a gaming laptop decision for awhile before I took the plunge. I looked at all the other typical contenders -- HP Omen, couple of ASUS ones... This one took the cake primarily because I prefer its unassuming aesthetic to the others that look like EPIC GAMER SPACESHIPS.It runs perfectly on every level I wanted it to. Boots up wicked fast, runs whatever I throw at it. Runs a little hot during intense graphics but every single other one does too (except maybe alienware). And the design is super sleek.If you know you want a gaming laptop but you're doubting which brand/model. Stop wondering. This is the one.",0
"(Great Value, has some shortcomings but still better option than what I could find in April 2022): I order this in April 2022. For $1.5k which is A LOT of money for me to spend on a laptop. I am upgrading from an Acer Predator Helios 315-52 which I got for $900. But hey... its not 2018 anymore. I upgraded to this for a better GPU, CPU and some quality of life features. I intended to use this laptop for Programming, 3D Designing, and some gaming.Remember that you DO NOT have to create a Microsoft account to use your laptop.

Any 12th gen i9 will thermal throttle. So no point in paying more for no real life benefit.- 3060 is good. I wish there was a 3070 ti version.- MUX switch- Thunderbolt 4 for easy docking. Not sure yet if you can charge from this port or not.- Most IO are on left hand side. Would have preferred having it on the back but this is okay.- Customizable keyboard color so it doesn't have to stay 1 gamery shade of rainbow.- Wifi 6 while still having the Ethernet option- Upgradable RAM and Storage- Comparable Acer Nitros were around $1800. Decided to save the money and use it for a color accurate monitor or new RAM- Adjustable fan speed.CONS:- Came with a scratch on the corner... Shrugged it off but not a good start.- Gets very hot while playing games like Witcher 3, Cyberpunk, Skyrim, etc. Kind of turns me off from playing games for long... but it does force me to be more productive. I've tried risers, cooling pads, both, and laptop alone. Nothing helps. I believe cooling the laptop does have an effect but the performance will just increase to keep it at the high temps. You cannot reduce the target temps below 70. I would rather have less performance with longer life, keeping it at lower temps increases lifespan.- 16 GB Dual Channel (8+8) but it was Single Rank. Before purchasing there was no confirmation on if it was Single or Dual Rank memory. I would have preferred they could have given me a single channel 16 GB so I could add another one. But oh well.- ASUS Armoury and Aura software is more complex than it has to be... and has too many terms to agree to before you can use your laptop to the fullest.- Not 100% sure but I have heard from others that thunderbolt cannot be used to charge the laptop. Will confirm when I get a dock.- Bottom shell has zigzags.... why? Doesn't this add complexity for no benefits?- Bottom plastic shell was very soft. My iFixit ""guitar pick"" tool bent and scratched it and clips on this shell already broke. I did not force it more than normal.- Metal clips inside the case will bend very easily. Honestly I don't understand why there needs to be clips on the shell if you have screws anyways?- Sharp-ish edges?- Noisy Fan but there is a silent mode",0

For my applications, it's the 8GB VRAM that matters, so the reduced voltage is not a concern.The laptop feels cheap and looks cheap,but I bought it for the spec, not the user experience, nonetheless, it seems that MSI spent the effort on garish non-essentials. The touch squeaks and flexes, the overall form factor is excessively large, the keyboard feels ok, but not great. The display is ok. The annoying sticker to the right of track pad started curling up on the upper left corner and constantly irritated my right palm. So I had to peel it off; now I have to find extra time to smooth out the sticky residues. The technical support of MSI is also pathetic, just plain awful.BTW, for fellow Linux users. Pop_OS installed on the GL66 smoothly and effortless, however, it (both 20.04LTS and 21.04) suffers from intermittent freezes that can only be remedied by power-down. Can you imagine running a long batch job w/ this erratic behavior? Solution? Anaconda on Windows...",0
"(Awesome Quality..Gaming Laptop without the big price tag): My 11 year old grandson loves PC Gaming and wanted a gaming laptop in order to play when he comes to visit and when they travel. It's awesome right out of the box, extremely fast and with no lagging. We did order and added 8gb of ram and 1tb of memory. Can't touch this ... For the price !!!",0
"(This laptop is nearly perfect.): I haven't been a fan of Dell computers in the past. In my experience they come bloated with extra software that can't be removed and are almost impossible to work on. This is the first one that I have owned in a long time and I was pleasantly surprised. The only bloatware that comes on it is Dells phone app that is a replica of the one built in to the OS and their support app. Both can be removed if you choose. Normally I would do a clean Windows install to get rid of all of the crap but I didn't have to this time.I read a lot of reviews that the touchscreen wasn't responsive but I haven't experienced any problems with it. I think that might have been fixed in a software update. The combination of Intel's 10th gen I-7 processor, 16gb of DD4 ram and M.2 NVME SSD makes this laptop blazing fast. The ram can be upgraded to 32gb and it has two free M.2 slots available. It comes with a 1tb M.2 PCI-E SSD and the other two free slots are easily accessed to be able to add more. Most laptops these days come with integrated graphics cards but this one has a dedicated Nvidia GTX 1650 TI. I'm not a heavy gamer so I'm not sure how it would perform with graphics intensive games but I think would hold its own. I've thrown multitasking with several excel sheets on different monitors and some light gaming on it and haven't had any lag at all.I would rate the battery life as average. Depending on how I use it and the screen brightness I can get about 6-8 hours on a charge. The good thing is that it doesn't take long at all to charge back up. 30 minutes of charging will net you another 3-4 hours.My only gripe about this laptop is the fingerprint sensor. It is built in with the power button and I often have to try multiple times to get it to read or end up putting my pin in. I would have like it better if they would have had a separate for the sensor. With that said though I absolutely love it. It is leaps and bounds above the Gen 2 Surface pro laptop that I was using.",0
"(That it's light weight, got anti glare, but the touch screen helps alot): It's a good laptop",0
(Easy to use.): Granddaughters loved them. Are well made and work great.,0
(One of the best value Laptops out there): I was looking for a Laptop around the 1300$ mark with a 3070 (130W). This is the best option for an RTX 3070 out in the market at this point in my opinion.,0
"(Great gaming laptop): Great gaming laptop, especially for the price! This pc will meet your needs. I'm a FPS gamer, and it runs everything on ultra with a smooth 60+fps.",0
(Best deal out there on a laptop that can be easily upgraded if needed.): Best deal out there on a laptop that can be easily upgraded if needed. Price is a deal.,0
"(Slower than Molasses in January): I absolutely do not recommend. This is slower than my 2014 HP laptop I bought for 400 dollars. I bought this because it had a big screen and looked like it would be decently quick to run simple programs, like a word processor.",0
(RESOLUCION): Tiene una resolución muy efectiva. Sus mandos responden rapidamente y es amigable su sistema. Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra.,0
"(For this price, out of competition.): I like this laptop. To keep the laptop quiet and not overheat in games I did folowing. Find on the Internet how to enable the ProcessorPerformanceBoostMode in Power Option. Then select ""Effectively Aggressive"" instead of ""Aggressive"". Gaming performance will not drop, the Laptop will not heat up more than 60 degrees Celsius and will be quiet even under havy load.",0
there is a lot of bloatware that this machine comes with,0
"(Best gaming laptop for the price): The best first gaming laptop , the only downside is the body is made of a ""fingerprint magnet"" plastic and it might feel a bit cheap but for the price and the specs is really good.",0
(Just a disappointment): Something in the screen literally burst it and broke the screen so my daughter can't use it after a month of having it.,0
"(Gift recipient seems very happy with the Chromebook): Purchased as a gift, so I haven't used it. Gift recipient seems very happy with the Chromebook.",0
"This is a very solid laptop, designed to be a thin and light laptop for gaming.",0
"(Excelente notebook para lo básico): Muy buena computadora y precio, el único detalle que noté es que la iluminación del teclado no es tan fuerte como se muestra en las fotografías, pero es agradable cuando la iluminación del ambiente es baja.Lo demás muy bien, la estética es increíble. Para la gente de latinoamérica se puede configurar windows en espa?ol y poder usar el teclado con ? y tildes.Me encantó.",0
"(5/10 stars, 1 thumbs up, perfect in every way (but 3/5 stars for QOL annoyances)): EDIT: This laptop gets WAY TOO HOT. I actually no longer recommend purchasing it. It is very capable and can do almost anything, but the cooling system is entirely insufficient. I consistently get temps of 80-90 degrees Celsius playing WoW Classic with nothing else in the background but Spotify. That game is a hundred years old and should not be taxing on the system, even at max graphics. Very concerned and disappointed about the investment I've made.If this is the only computer in your budget, I STRONGLY suggest purchasing the best cooling pad money can buy. I have settled on using an old, bulky laptop as a cooling pad which has helped. I feel bamboozled tbh.I love this laptop like Tom Cruise loved Katie Holmes before things went dark(er).It feels so much more expensive than it is. Sounds great, looks great, FEELS great.- Keyboard is wonderful. Display is beautiful.- Graphics are fantastic. I'm not missing the RTX 2060+ because I don't make a living being a caricature on livestreams.- Fan placement is logical (FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I CAN SAY THIS ABOUT MY LAPTOP) and runs VERY quiet, shockingly.- Fantastic for gaming, video editing, and everything I can throw at it, to be honest.I'm in love and will be sticking to Acer from now on.ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT:- Wavesys turns your camera on automatically by default so it can alter the sound when you plug in headphones. The idea is that the camera tracks the position of your head and adjusts the sound accordingly so you get a 360-degree experience. Great sentiment but super creepy and not something I asked for. I've disabled it. Not my kind of thing. There are so many things to set up/customize when getting a new computer and I didn't need this to be one of them.- Annoying startup sound/animation. Easy enough to turn off (you can google it and find instructions from Acer that are dummy proof bc I was able to do it) but still annoying and not needed. Again, there are so many things to set up/customize when getting a new computer and I didn't need this to be one of them.- Trackpad: I would have liked left/right-click buttons but I'm sure I'll get used to the single trackpad. It is very smooth and responsive but just FYI if you're switching over from a Macbook or something with actual buttons.Overall, a fantastic buy I'd recommend for someone looking to do everything well. If you need to do everything or something(s) at the highest level then look elsewhere. Please do your research and see if you really need to spend what YouTube channels or canned blog posts suggest. I almost bought a $2k+ machine for what this computer does incredibly well at roughly half the price. Treat yo self but don't give that sleazeball Bezos anything more than he already sucks out of us.",0
(NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS RESELLER): PRODUCT FAILED WITHIN 90 DAYS AND WILL NOT REFUND MONEY.AMAZON WILL NOT HELP WITH CLAIM.AVOID THIS RESELLER,0
The built-in equalizer in this device lets me customize the sound output according to my preferences. It's greatly improved my multimedia experience.,1
(junk): Would not start right after bought,0
Suffering from random FPS drops and this kills your gaming experience.,0
(Windows): Windows conflicts with the laptop consider changing it to windows 10 and maybe upgrading the network card as it isn't that great otherwise very good machine,0
It's fairly lightweight and has a sturdy feel to it.,0
"(Excellent Value): got it for $850 on a pre BF deal. The screen is beautiful with a 144hz refresh rate. It has an excellent processor and graphics card which makes it great for gaming and for routine office work. My only gripe is with the battery life which is mediocre esp while playing games. The keyboard is white backlit, would be nice if it was RGB.",0
"(Excelente laptop!): Excelente equipo, funciona perfecto con los programas de diseño y 3D, llego en perfectas condiciones, y llego antes de la fecha. (No trae Ñ en el teclado pero en la configuración lo cambias por otra)",0
(It's fast and it's ultra quiet.): Super screen. It's not a light weight but it's really fast.,0
(PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED NOT OPERATING): LAPTOP WAS RECEIVED AND DOESNT TURN ON... COMPLETED FAIL,0
"(Great laptop): This gaming computer has everything I need. Was easy to set up out the box, plugged all my accessories in without an issue. Only downfall is battery does not last very long off wall charger but I don't intend to use it that long on battery level.",0
"(Good pc but this is the worst battery): it's a great overall computer, but the battery is awful. After only 2 years my computer has to be plugged in to work, the battery just doesn't work.",0
(great product): great product and good service,0
(Revisar equipo antes de enviar): Revisar los productos antes del envío ya que mi laptop dejo de servir la carga a la batería y tuve que arreglar por mis propios medios,0
DOES NOT COME WITH THE LIGHT UP NUMBERPAD ON THE TRACKPAD,0
"(Disappointing): I purchased the laptop a little more than a year ago. The sound quality truly sucks but the computer was doing its job. I liked the touch screen, the small size that fits into my purse, and the fact the laptop is very light. However one of the keys fell out on the keyboard after only one year. I didn't expect Acer to be as sturdy as my Mac but after paying more than $1k for this laptop, I didn't expect that the keys would fall out. This has never happened with any of my prior laptops. Disappointing.",0
(Not worth it): Horrible device cant factory reset to fix issues with no space cant understand since nothing has been downloaded besides one game the my child plays i even tried uninstalling things and still nothing it constantly jumos off the wifi for no reason dont bother with asus it waste.,0
"(La mas barata que encontre con i3 de 11th gen): Me gusto la carcasa superior de aluminio. No me gusto Los plastics en general. Se compró en noviembre de 2022. Tenia windows 10 y se actualualizó a win 11, El problema es que desde que tienen win 11, SE ha calentado dos Veces hasta El Punto de apagarse y seguir caliente por UN largo rato. Tal vez aparenta estar apagada y Sigue trabajando hasta terminar la bateria.",0
(Mother board problems): Bought one year ago..mother board went out 3 days ago. Unable to repair according to technician.,0
"(Slow!): Slowest computer I have ever had. Only purchased to use adobe and editing software as I have a chromebook that does everything else but does not support adobe software. I have had HP in the past and hoped for a better experience since the last time I purchased an HP was in 2011 for college, however…. All other features are fine. Just, very slow loading ???",0
"(Wouldn't buy again): It just feels like it's build for the least amount of quality possible, but not so bad that it can't carry the Google name. We'll be buying a new one soon to replace the one we got our son.",0
"(Great for digital art and 2D animation): I bought this for school to make digital art and animation. It works well for those purposes, but I've honestly spent most of my time with the laptop playing video games. Pretty much everything from like PS3/360 era and before can run at high settings fairly stably. I don't think it can even launch most newer triple A games, so I haven't even tried.",0
"(Overall, a pretty good laptop): I've been using this laptop for almost a year now. I am pretty happy with it, overall. The touchpad is really finicky, some days it works great and some days it shudders constantly. The power supply is big and bulky. What good is a portable laptop with a non-portable power supply.Otherwise, it is fast, stays cool, and has a nice screen ( I did not want a touch screen, so I had to get the only non-touch option). Battery life is pretty good, even when running heavy-duty engineering software.",0
This laptop is fast and very responsive though it takes awhile getting it there so make sure you go through the Windows 10 settings with an fine toothed comb.,0
(perfect): My son is incredibly happy with this purchase. Thank you,0
(Awsome!!): My son loves it thanx!!,0
"(Battery stopped working, had to send it back for replacement): The laptop was good while it lasted (which was 5 months). Had to send it back because it wouldn't turn on, even after attempting to reset the battery. 2/5",0
(it was a gift): he loved it,0
"(perfect ,just what I wanted.): wow,for a chrome book it has a huge screen. I have always been a Samsung fan in the past. this Acer changed my mind !!",0
"(Great laptop, worth the money (for casual gamer)): I bought this gaming laptop for playing Steam games on the PC. I have to say I’m pleasantly surprised.The computer has a keyboard that glows different LED colors while you use it. It has 7.1 surround sound with headphones or just plain good sound without. It’s quick and quiet even without the additional the ram that everyone seems to advise (though I wish I didn’t have to take the entire bottom off to add more). I wanted a gaming PC for the casual gamer.., mission accomplished.",0
(great value): Very fast and lite weight,0
"(Very Happy with This Lappy!): This is a perfect little laptop for travel or home use. Love how quickly the Chrome operating system starts up. Camera is great for video conferencing. The RAM isn't high enough to do intense graphic design, but it will do graphic based document editing well enough.",0
"(Great buy so far but I just got it.): This machine, MSI GL65 Leopard 10SFK-062, is running great. I just received it today but doing everything I want it to at this point.Just a couple of questions that I need assistance with:1. What brand of SSD are people upgrading these machines with. I want to put another 1TB drive in but at a lost to what one. Thinking about the ""860 EVO SATA 2.5"" SSD 1TB"".Anyone got some experience with this particular machine ? I would really appreciate all the help I can get.2. Same problem with the ram. Figure as long as I am in the machine I might as well upgrade to 32 from 16.Please, any expert help from those who have done this would be appreciated.ThanksJim",0
"(An 'ok' product): OK product. Didn't like the fact that 'Caps Lock' was missing, and screen changed color after only one week. I had to return it right away and vet refunded.",0
"(What a piece of crap, wont charge.): What a piece of crap, wont charge. Acer needs a 10 days to send out new charger, might not fix the problem. NEVER BUYING AN ACER AGAIN. Also window s mode is a bunch of crap. Dont buy this. Amazon this is a problem.",0
(So far it's been doing great. I like the thin style and it looks ...): So far it's been doing great. I like the thin style and it looks like MacBook but with a cheaper price.,0
(Very happy with my purchase!!): It is exactly everything I wanted and I am so happy with my purchase!! I will definitely order again from this company!!,0
(Mmm...): So this is supposed to be a gaming laptop. I put music software on it and it slows it down and sometimes closes the program. I'm really disappointed because this laptop is not cheap.,0
(Great for gamers): I love everything but the battery. About an hour use when gamming.,0
(ITs TOP KNOTCH!!): It was a great buy and will HIGHLY RECOMMEND for others.,0
"(It's very slow): This turned out to be very slow. We bought it for my 2nd grader's remote schooling. He can't have more than a couple of browser windows open, and the zooms are very slow when there's lots of participants because the graphics slow down.",0
It has beautiful color and contrast and really impressed me as soon as I turned the computer on.,0
(AWESOME): What a great computer. Great directions on how to setup and most is automatically setup for you. You just sip your coffee and let the machine do it for you. Love it!You cannot go wrong with this computer.,0
(Good): I love it no damages towards it brand new hope it has a long lifespan,0
(No DVD player!): Disappointed that there is not a DVD player. Why wasn’t I told this?,0
"(motherboard problem- BUY THE PROTECTION PLAN): First review I have ever written. Two years after purchasing this, the computer died and needs a new motherboard. The repair cost is more than half the original purchase price. BUY THE PROTECTION PLAN. Seems to be a common problem for the this computer based on the Dell support pages.",0
(Pretty satisfying laptop): The only complaint is the screen is small in my opinion. It just makes it harder to play fps games that’s all.,0
"(Very useful!): Fast processor, lightweight, and small size.",0
(Súper recomendado): Rapidez y calidad,0
"(Not good ,I am from England): It will not allow me to download,and not suitable for the uk the plug is incorrect size,this for America.power. source",0
"(Great bang for the buck and solid customer service by Sager): So I bought the previous generation last year but that listing is discontinued so I'm writing my review here instead. The laptop is very high quality, games run very smooth and I personally really like that the video output ports are in the back so I can plug in my dual monitors without having wires coming out of the sides.A little over a year after I bought it it wouldn't turn on though. So I contacted the manufacturer and sent it for repair. Turns out it was a dead motherboard which is usually very expensive to fix. Thankfully they honored the warranty since it was due to faulty hardware and sent it back fixed 2 weeks later and so far it's working great again. Their customer service was very responsive and answered every question quickly.Will definitely be sticking with Sager next time I need a new laptop.",0
"(Blue Screens and Shuts Down...Constantly): Well, about three months in and four or five times a day it randomly and spontaneously just blue screens and shuts down. It has been miserable. You never know when it's just going to shut down on you! In the middle of drafting an assignment? Check. In the middle of making a power point presentation? Check. While watching a movie on Netflix at the end of the day? Check. And just as the warranty expire, too. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. For the price, it isn't worth it.",0
(Wondered why so many high reviews): I purchased this laptop because it had over 4000 good reviews. Like really highly rated reviews. But other than the low price I did not see any good preforming features. Overall a normal laptop that is pretty thin and light and cheap being the best features.,0
(Great): Very nice computer. Battery life is awesome,0
"(Una mala elección de compra): Es un laptop muy cara tiene problemas para la regulación de brillo de la pantalla, es muy complicado poderte poner en contacto con el proveedor y aún cuando solicitas la factura en repetidas ocasiones te mandan el mismo formulario de lo cual llenas pero nunca te mandan la factura, yo no recomiendo este producto.",0
(User friendly): Bought to work from home. User friendly. Gets the job done. Can't go wrong for the price.,0
Runs a bit hot on the surface when gaming and the fans a bit load,0
(awesome lap top!!): I love everything about this lap top!! it is very portable since it weighs less than five pounds!! everything works well on this laptop!! that's why I only buy from dell!! superior products and good support!! I would highly recommend this laptop!! five stars!!!,0
"Downloads are faster, as are software installs.",0
"(Speedy): Had it for over a year now. Boots fast, plays new games on max in 1080p with great fps.",0
The downside is the fans are loud.,0
"(Great laptop): Nothing I didn't like, this little laptop is perfect!",0
"(Best bang for your buck- so far so good!): For reference, I purchased the 32 GB RAM 1TB SSD laptop.I was hesitant to purchase this laptop, but after reading some reviews I bit the bullet. I was pleasantly surprised.My package arrived in two days and was neatly arranged. I plugged it in and everything was set up, all I needed to do was install Windows 10 (basically just follow directions).As of October 15th, 2020, this computer can run almost every game I need. The graphics card (RTX 2060) is powerful and effective. Whether FPS or MMO so far I haven't run into any issues running games.The screen is large and lightweight. Be careful when opening it, it appears as though the hinge where it meets the base of the laptop is susceptible to damage and/or bending if you put the laptop in a bag or if you handle it without care.There are two USB ports on the right and two USB ports on the left. Audio and mic jacks are on the left side, the power plug, ethernet, and HDMI are in the back. There is also a micro SSD slot on the right side I believe, I never use them.Biggest con (which is expected in a gaming laptop) is that it can heat quickly. I highlly recommend getting a cooling pad to help keep your system from overheating. Even when installing Twitch, Steam, and the Battle Net launcher, I noticed the fans perc up a bit and start blasting heat out the side vents.There are vents on the bottom and sides of the laptop so angling the back vents in the air may be best.I will update this review if I find any issues with the computer. As of now, I am happy with it and would recommend to other who are looking for a high end PC for gaming and work.",0
it has a pretty minimal battery life,0
"(screen not very bright, get the 2017 if you can find one.): I ordered the 2017 Samsung laptop model but they shipped the newer 2018 model. I wanted the 2017 because I had already read the newer one''s screen wasn't as bright and had tried out a 2017 at a BxxxBxx store a couple months earlier, and YUP, it is true. In the course of dealing w/ Amazon to ""exchange"" the 2018 model for the one I actually ordered, the price went up considerably on the older (and better reviewed) model, so I kept the 2018. It's ""okay"" for what I need, but not nearly as good as my old Samsung 2nd generation, which I still use but now has to be tethered full-time to the cord--so not too portable anymore...",0
"(Apple Pencil and IPad Pro go together like birds of a feather): Love painting with my iPad and pencil. Large screen (12/9) is nice. Fast responses, great enhanced motion.",0
"(Great computer. Battery life is abysmal): This computer works with everything I throw at it gaming-wise. My only real issues with it are the battery life and how it acts on the battery. Games sputter when on the battery, even games that don't need much resources like Rogue Legacy. I also added an extra 1tb m.2 drive and another 8gb of RAM",0
(One Star): Attention. This computer does not come with an SD card.. you can’t download things,0
"(Gaming laptop): Made for gaming. I've had no problems running various games at high setting with no frame rate drop. As far as everything else, no complaints. Gets a bit warm after a while, like any laptop made for gaming would. Invest in an external fan.",0
"(Could be better): The laptop is decent but what im upset about is the camera quality its pretty bad for. 1,000$ gaming laptop battery isnt the best but as expected for a gaming laptop.",0
"The trackpad isn't sensitive enough, and it requires a lot of force to push down.",0
The larger touch pad is a nice addition and allows easier movement across the screen without having to lift your finger and start again,0
The touchpad is very fussy about where you press it to get a left click or a right-click.,0
(Super Deal): Grandson loves it - uses it at school,0
(great!): Use it everyday,0
(GREAT VALUE): Extremely satisfied with this Dell Laptop. Perfect size. No issues. Running Great.,0
"(Faulty charging port): My Samsung chromebook had a faulty charging port, had to jiggle and hold the charging cord in place else it wouldn't charge. Good computer otherwise.Return this item for a refund.",0
"(Lightweight, quality laptop, mostly good!): Lightweight, quality laptop that's very good. Only problem is has is a super-sensitive trackpad that picks up extra mouse-clicks from time to time.Slim, elegant design, very decent batter life.",0
"(Just a glorified tablet, not a laptop.): Do not purchase if you have windows compatible hardware, such as printers, that you will want to use with it because they are not compatible. I have very limited needs with a laptop but this could not meet them. I had to look up how to turn on capslock because the keyboard doesn't have a capslock button.",0
(Deal): Grandson loves this,0
"(ASUS IS THE BEST): I LOVE YOU ASUS, THE BEST PC",0
"(Snappy starter laptop): This is a good budget/starter laptop tthat has great potential. I like the screen size and the fact that this is quick for having a lower tier CPU. I immediately upgraded the SSD to a larger 256 GB Drive. I have never personally had an Acer laptop but I have used them and worked on them in the past and this is one is on par with my previous experiences. The screen is bright and sharp and the OS is quick, at least until it gets bloated with all the junk we acquire. Over all, this is a really snappy machine and I'm pleased with it's performance. I tried set this to dual boot with Linux but I couldn't get it running right so I went back to just Windows. This is a great budget laptop with a crisp display, which is really nice for us older folks! I'll come back to update my review if anything changes my opinion on this unit",0
"I think that's highly misleading if it ships with 2x8GB, which is how mine arrived.",0
"(I received my laptop today and loved it. The only problem is that when I ...): I received my laptop today and loved it. The only problem is that when I plug in my head phones, it seems to not recognize it and will play the sound from the speakers instead. I have not yet tried it with any other head phones, but when I do and if they work I will change my review. If they do not work, I guess I'll just have to return it. Pretty disappointing.",0
"(Honestly...): I was hoping to better the workflow within Cinema 4d and DaVinci Resolve with this laptop, and it exceeded all expectations! Although it's at its best when plugged in, I'm more than satisfied with the results. In addition, what I really appreciate, is the screen with its refresh rate and color coverage, as well as the keyboard that looks and feels fantastic. Looking forward to challenging that beast with other real-world tasks, so might update the review.",0
(Pretty alright computer): Laptop is pretty solid if you have a low budget got a computer only issue i have experienced so far with it is the speakers were damaged when i got it and you may need to upgrade the graphic card which is an extra $30 but thats only annoying not something that “ruins” or makes the computer bad.,0
"(Best Laptop for the money compare to HP Omen): This replaced my HP Omen, very responsive, light and still enjoying it after adding my apps. Definitely would recommend to any techie. Doesn't has a CD ROM, for me it was none issue. Battery life is very good right now for the number of cell.",0

"(Fairly priced): Pretty standard , fair price",0
The screen is fabulous and the overspeed fan keeps it cool under pressure.,0
"(Great midrange laptop): Was able to do more than I expected with this laptop. I can play a lot of big title games with a mix of mid to high settings. The sound is about what you would expect from a laptop but nobody picks a laptop based on it's stock speakers. Says it has windows 10 but you will be asked to upgrade to 11 for free on startup. If you're looking for an affordable laptop to get started with PC gaming, I can recommend this one from my experience.",0
"The sound is tinny, which is unforgivable considering how huge the speaker grills are",0
the power cable that comes with it is short.,0
(New laptop): Nice computer,0
"(What I needed.): This was a great but for price paid. Great display, responsive keyboard, plenty of storage. It's quick to boot up, and smoothly opens programs with unnoticeably wait time.You'll wanna buy one for everyone in your household.",0
"(Gread device, lower metal frame it's a bit flimsy.): It's a great device! It's fast due to its ssd and video card. But you have to remember it's a Windows machine so it can only get to where the OS permits.I use it to edit photos in a very non-efficient program, Skylum Luminar, it loads faster than in my previous razer blade 15 2018 base model, but it's still Windows!It's very easy to carry around, it's light and fancy. Battery last long, really long for a device this size.MSI was nice to include a USB-C hub for additional connectivity and a leather-like carrying pouch -nice touch.Happy with the device? So far, YES!!!!!! I just wish Windows took advantage of the hardware of this beast.",0

"((UPDATE 8/4/2021) Extremely powerful, terrible battery life and LOUD fans (too be expected)): RTX 2070 and i7 10750 is a monster combo. Smashes through games like nothing at 1080p. This GPU could easily play 1440p above 60fps on ultra settings, for example Modern Warfare 2019 is over 100fps maxed out no RTX, World War Z is over 100fps maxed out. Any game you want. CPU gets toasty average around 90C keyboard doesn't get hot, but it is a very small chassis. The keyboard goes all the way out to the edges because there is almost no screen bezel. It's a super nice laptop build wise. Not built like a Razer Blade, but very nice nonetheless. Fans are LOUD when gaming, they work well.Overall it's a very aggressive, super powerful gaming laptop. You will not be disappointed in that regard. The battery life and fan noise you will be disappointed with if that bothers you. Battery life is a MAX of 3 hours. I have only got 2 1/2 hours web browsing with no keyboard backlight and display almost all the way dim.UPDATE 8/4/21:I purchased this laptop in May of 2020 for less than $1500. I DO NOT think this laptop is worth $2k. Wait for newer laptops to become available and for scalpers to stop well.... Scalping.Also speakers are the worst thing I've ever used on almost any device. LITERALLY zero base what so ever, sounds like they are inside of a large empty can. Keyboard looks like new still, Trackpad is starting to get shiny in the middle where it is used the most. It kept getting to hot in the CPU area playing Warzone so I put Kryonaut thermal paste and use Throttlestop to undervolt and lower frequency a bit to keep it around 80 Celcius.",0
"(Great laptop; I love it so far!): I've had this laptop for about a week. It's my first gaming laptop and I love it. I'm using this laptop for work, school, and gaming. It does all I need it to with some added flair.The graphics are beautiful and my games look better and run well. I like that it's light for a gaming laptop and it's pretty portable. I like the MSI has settings to help protect the battery life for those that are plugged in most of the time. The camera quality is really nice for video calls/meetings. I like that I can use bluetooth devices.Since it is a gaming laptop, I expect the fan to be loud when it's on full blast. This isn't much of an issue but it can get noisy for those in voice calls. It gets pretty smudgy even if i wash my hands kind of often. It took a bit to get used to the speakers being on the bottom, though I imagine as a gaming laptop it anticipates gamers having a headset.Again, lovin' it.",0
"(Solid Form and Functionality): Very happy with it so far. Love the matte finish and coming from a Zbook 17, this is like a feather; super light, but without feeling flimsy. The three mouse buttons below the keyboard are absolutely make or break for me for two handed navigation so very happy here, though I do feel that it doesn't always register some clicks. Also a bit disappointed that the function and control keys, though swappable, aren't physically swappable due to the different key sizes (with the control key coming up short after the BIOS swap).Otherwise the battery life is fantastic, typing on the keyboard is enjoyable, and no complaints about the trackpad. The home and end keys, which I use frequently while coding, are in about a good a position as they can be I suppose, given the area limitation.Lastly, the IR camera for face sign in is a subtle but lovely feature that almost makes me forget that it's doing any ""signing in"" at all. After a couple of times registering my face, it's very quick at recognizing me.All in all very happy with the purchase and am enjoying going about as far on a single charge as I do with my phone.",0
"(Nice computer, but kept dropping wifi): I got this chrome book and kind of liked it. The monitor is fairly big and very sharp. Though chrome is limited at a few things, I love how quick it is. I open it up, it's ready in a couple of seconds. The problem o kept having is that it kept dropping my wifi signal. When it happened, there was nothing to do other than restart it. It wasn't all that bad, because restarts are fast. After a while though, it just happened too often. I read it is a common problem with hp chrome books so I was left with no option but to send it back to Amazon. I'm ordering an acer one and keeping my fingers crossed.A couple of other things I didn't care for about this Chromebook were that the screen was actually a bit small for me. Also, the speakers are facing from the bottom, which works well on a hard surface, but if you lay this thing down on the couch or rug, or even on your lap, it's pretty hard to hear it.",0
"(Battery life is not good at all, no back-lit keyboard): Aside from not having a back-lit keyboard and having an absolutely terrible battery life, this computer does the trick.",0
"(EXCELENTE PRODUCTO): Excelente notebook, tiene un sonido de otro mundo, material que al tacto parece aluminio, la batería dura muchísimo, veloz, la definición de pantalla es muy buena. No tengo nada malo para decir. El flex funciona perfecto. 100% recomendable",0
(Good bang for buck!): I bought this for my son for remote college and he loves it!,0
it always blue screen when playing game and I try to fix it (e.g. update the driver or windows) by finding the solution on internet but the situation still happen.,0
it is very fast,0
(Precio-Calidad): Muy buena laptop..!,0
"(Terrible Terrible screen, ruining this unit. Worse than expected!): Terrible terrible screen . Worse than expected, color coverage across the entire screen is not even even when looking straight at this thing! God forbid you move your head more than 1/8"" when viewing a picture or video and you just got another set of colors.",0
"(At the beginning the computer was working fairly well, ...): At the beginning the computer was working fairly well, but later on, the blue screen of death started to appear, the video sometimes it flash, or get some sync error lines.In the last week the starting is becoming a disaster, the keyboard flash every 5 seconds on then 5 seconds off. I have disconnected all the cables and this Radom behavior continue. Today I have tried to start many times, the screen is black, sometimes give me the blue screen. From time to time it start, I have tried to backup my files, but the blue screen appear again.I have upgraded the BIOS, reseted it but the windows and the laptop is unstable.",0
(This one made mw happy.): I bought 3 different laptops before I was hally with one. This one made mw happy.,0
The battery can stay alive up to 7 hours depends on how you doing with it.,0
"(Solid gaming laptop with a few issues): I got this laptop(2060 SKU) in prime day deals and used it for 2 weeks now. Honestly speaking this device does have its own issues but most of them can be solved permanently or temporarily with fixes and workarounds. If you spend the time and tweak/tune it, its well worth the effort.Pros:- Very good and stable performance. 6 hours of gaming with no visible fps degradation. You need to put in another stick for dual channel though.- Chassis quality and hinges. It gives a premium feel overall. Very dense materials cause it to be much heavier than it looks. Solid and compact.- Nice panel, most units come with an AUO that has many calibration files over internet that u can apply but mine came with a similar quality LG panel. Unfortunately isnt as colour accurate out of the box. Still looks gorgeous in games, however.- Good keyboard if you can live with the gamer-y looks.Cons:- Asus bloatware. It hijacks your Windows Powerplan and causes kb rgb issues in some modes.- Some coil whine and backlight bleeding. But this is up to your luck and can happen with any other laptop as well.Other thoughts:- 2060 sku is much cooler than 2070. Mine hovers around mid/low 70s for both processors on average while running Witcher 3. Maybe low 80s on cpu for more intense games like BF 5. But many people complain about thermals in 704gw.- Myasus app allows you to change the battery charging profile. This can help with yor battery lifespan. Only useful software that comes with the laptop.- Amazon promotion isnt valid if you're not a US resident. Kind of a bummer but no big deal.Overall I'm happy with its performance. Runs cool enough so my Ocd self doesn't have to worry.",0
"(Pretty Good except the audio jack): Almost everything is perfect about this laptop, however, one of my extra bass sony earpods produces continuous white noise when plugged into this computer, another earpods had the same problem but the volume is much lower, apple's earpods doesn't have this issue. I guess there's some low frequency bug in this computer which seems to be a common issue of the xps13. The speakers are fine.",0
(Four Stars): Good for FPS games,0
"(Bought if for my small business and I made the right choice.): It's fast, durable, and does everything I need it to do. I thought about buying parts to upgrade it before I got it but when I started using it I decided against it. I killed the battery pretty fast using it for the first time so I usually just keep it plugged in but there are battery saving options for those that intend to use the battery and to use that keep it plugged in to preserve the life of the battery.",0
"(Great for a student.): I searched for the right small laptop for about 3 months. I was deadset on the HP Spectre before I came across the ASUS. The reason I chose this one over the Spectre, XPS, ENVY, LG Gram, or the Matebook was mainly because this thing is super sturdy. This ultrabook feels very solid. There is no give on the keyboard or the screen and everything about it screams quality. I've had this for a month now and I am very happy with it. It's really fast! I have had no issues with the fingerprint scanner, the screen is beautiful, and the touchscreen is great. I've used it for the visible body apps which are fairly intensive and they worked great. Battery life is long! I get through an 8 hour school day. It's a little heavier than the competition but the build quality really is so much superior. There is nothing cheap about this little laptop. It can also do some light gaming. I've played Civ VI , World of Warcraft, and Crusader Kings II on it with no issues. If I had to nitpick one thing I'd say the speakers could be a little better, otherwise A++++",0
(2019): Good 💻 fair price,0
"(Compact & great for gaming): Bought this for my son, who plays a lot of games on Steam. It's been great. The fact that it has a graphics card really sold me on this. It's been a great laptop. Well-made and easy to set up. We're all glad with this purchase.",0
The 16Gb of fast ram is nice,0
(Very Efficient and Works Well): The computer works great! It also came seven days early which was really convenient!,0
"(EVEN WITH AUTISM! ....THIS HAS BEEN THEE MOST USER FRIENDLY AND FAST!!!): WE HAVE TWO SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN AND A NOT SO TECHNICAL ME AND WHILE WE HAVE NEVER HAD ENOUGH TO SPEND ON A TRULY GOOD COMPUTER WE FINALLY WERE ABLE TO THIS YEAR. I SHOPPED FOR MONTHS AND FOUND THIS LAPTOP TO BE THE GREATEST VALUE IN A ROCKET FAST GAMING COMPUTER MY SON WITH HIGH FUNTIONING AUTISM CAN USE WITH NO HELP FROM ME!!! TO SEE HIM EXCEL IS A JOY. HE HAS ENROLLED IN COLLEGE AND IS ALSO USING THIS FOR CLASSES BOTH ONLINE AND IN PERSON AND UNLIKE EVERY LAPTOP IVE EVER BOUGHT HIM , HE HAS NOTHING BUT PRAISE FOR MSI !!!

(Good lap top): Looks good. Solid quality but the title says 14' but it's not. Specs say 11',0
"(Lasted 3.5 years, and then stopped working): In the first year I had this, the network card stopped working and I had to replace it. Then, after a little under 3.5 years, it would not boot up; a capacitor fused to the motherboard went bad, and replacing the whole motherboard it wasn’t an option. The tech guy tells me they see a lot of these models with the same problem after only a few years. Buyer beware …",0
"(First gaming laptop): This is my first gaming laptop and I did my research on what I should get. Obviously this was my choice, but I'm not disappointed in the least. The look, feel, speed, and overall features this laptop has blew me away. Definitely recommend this laptop to anyone who is getting into gaming or just needs a high performance laptop.",0
"(Great Product): This is a great product. I've had a couple of HP towers, and this Chromebook is very fast and responsive. I would buy it all over again!",0
(Great): Great product,0
"(For its price, a good value.): It has met my expectation.",0
(Sucks!): Worst laptop I've ever owned. I've had it a few months and have only used it 3 or 4 times. It runs so slowly. Takes forever to startup and most of the time the mouse cursor doesn't work. I wish I could return it. There nothing high performance about it.,0
(TRASH): screen went black and cast to repair is more then laptop. DON NOT BUY THIS TRASH,0
"this was probably a motherboard melting down, or some other small and unusual mechanical failure.",0
(Good product): It works fine for school work.,0
(died after 6 months): work good for 6 months then would not turn on. no support from company.,0
(Works great): This was recommended to me by a person who understands computers a lot more than I do. He has been using Chromebooks for several years now and swears by them. When I needed a new computer he found this one for me. It took a little getting used to but all in all I have been very happy with it. Learning the way it works wasn't much of a change from the Windows 8 I was used to. I had NO DESIRE to go to Windows 10....I had that and hated everything about it so this is a great alternative.,0
(for it to work): welp had trouble connecting to internet did total restart now its suck on wifi screen will not go any furtherwant tyo send back,0
"(Three Stars): Perfect overall performance, not so impreesing battery life, no backlit keyboard...",0
"(Publicidad enga?osa): Pros: La computadora es buena, su pantalla es excelente con buen brillo, la velocidad es acorde y lo que se espera por lo adquirido, el teclado es suave, teclado iluminado con opción de apagar, la calidad y materiales se ven buenos o duraderos, agrada la facilidad ara actualizar o mejorar la laptop.La durabilidad de la batería es decente, aun escuchando audio.Contra: Indicaban que vendría por la compra del portátil el Game de Call Of Duty Modern of War lo cual nunca sucedió, también decía que llegaría con sticker y no fue así.me preocupa un poco la durabilidad del pad mouse.Los parlantes para ser 7.1 no tienen la calidad de volumen que uno esperaria.",0

(Good value for price): Good value for price,0
(Laptop is not charging.): Very disappointing. The laptop is not charging and I bought it for my son who needs it for school. I plan on returning item as soon as I find out how to do so. Also in the title it says it was an Aspire E15 laptop and I got an E5. Don't go the cheap way unless you know the product is of great quality.,0

"The coil whine produced by the laptop is far too audible for me, and is definitely a dealbreaker.",0
"(Portable léger et rapide): Très bon portable, léger, rapide, tout fonctionne parfaitement. Livraison rapide et tout était bien emballé.",0
"(runs fine. Fans can be loud for others): Two months in, and not a single issue. Boots wuick, runs fine. Fans can be loud for others, but noise is directed away from the user.",0
"(Very good quality!!! Upgrades are EASY too): Loved: Durability, screen quality & speed.Disliked: Battery life.",0

IT IS MORE THAN CAPABLE OF MOST OF YOUR DAILY ACTVITIES WITH OUT THE USUAL BLOAT IN TODAY'S LOWER PRICED OFFERINGS.,0
"(Best laptop in the price range): I got this laptop after my old HP's hinge broke after 4 years of heavy use.In short, it's a great laptop and the best you're gonna find in the ""under $500"" price range. Will handle mid-range games and programs with ease and even some higher end ones as well. I benchmarked it out of the box and it can handle a lot of things you wouldn't expect from a laptop at this price.Can handle a significant amount of games. According to systemrequirementslabs this laptop meets the minimum requirements to handle 53/100 of the 100 most popular games out there. Among those are GTA5 and Fortnite. I've been able to run many mid-range games on this laptop in the past few games with a consistently high 50-60+ FPS on medium/high settings.Performance can be boosted on this laptop by installing the latest drivers (the ones it comes with are geared more towards power saving than performance) and changing the power saving settings to ""best performance"". This laptop isn't going to be running many modern day AAA titles, but it'll get the job done for most games out there. If you want to do heavy PC gaming, I recommend a desktop.In regards to everything else, the laptop is great. Zero issues so far since I've gotten it. You won't find anything better under $500. However, if you're going to go more into the $600-700 range, a laptop with an MX150 graphics card is better suited for mid-high range gaming. But again, at that price range a desktop is more recommendable.",0
"(BUENA LAPTO): La marca hace muy buenos productos, funciona excelente, pero por la cantidad que termine pagando hubiera preferido comprar una de 15.6 Pugadas, ya que se me cobro dos veces la importación. una la cobra AMAZON al momento de la compra y tambien le pagas lo de la importación al servicio de paquetería FEDEX México al momento de la entrega.",0
(Thinking about buying another one): Very easy to set up,0
"(10/10 value, esp. refurbished): Excellent in every regard, except outdoor brightness.",0
GS65 doesn't feel as solid and I would have expected a little more after shelling out $2000 for this thing.,0
"the keys seem completely flat, so I found it hard to center my fingers, and often hit two adjacent key simultaneously",0
"(Screen is dead in less than a year): In less than a year, I started to see dead vertical pixel lines on the screen. It started on the right side and started to spread everywhere. Then horizontal lines started to appear. The screen is all dead. When I contact with warranty service, they said that it was because of physical damage. They didn't even check the laptop, only replied by email, and refused to provide service. I don't even move the computer from the desk. There was no physical damage.Performance was good but don't waste your money with this plastic laptop. Get something more durable.",0
(Perfect!!): I have been wanting my own laptop for a while. This one is perfect size and I love the color white!!,0
"(Super fast, low battery life, great for playing any game): Bought this late last year for myself. Overall I'm happy with it. I went into it knowing it had a short battery life, was a little heavy, and possibly had a loud fan. The battery life is definitely really short, around 2 hours, so be prepared to carry around the charger with you. The fan makes noises, like any fan, it's fine. The backlit keyboard is nice and it's a really fast computer. Love the extra storage for my games. The sound quality good for the most part, I was expecting it to be a little bit better but no big deal. Overall very happy for my purchase. Make sure you know what things you're willing to sacrifice for a gaming laptop, because only the most expensive ones have everything you want.",0
(Love it): Great laptop,0
(Not good after two days): If it would have worked I'm sure it would have been an amazing machine. It came in on a Friday. Set it up and started downloading stuff on a Saturday. Needless to say on sunday when I went to get on the labtop it was flashing a white screen and I couldnt do nothing. Maybe it was just me but be careful.,0
"(Good Toshiba replacement. Not a touch screen like my old Satellite but knew it when purchased,): Like that I know when power is on, caps and numbers are locked. There are lights letting user know. Very fast. Thin and lightweight. Pleased with purchase.",0
"This penn is battery powered so you don't have to worry about charging it up to use, just swap out the AAA single battery and you are back up and running.",0
"(Wish it didn't have the number keys): Great laptop in soo many ways - weight #1, performance, good construction. But the number keys throw off your hand - particularly if you have adult size male hands. They should make a 2 models - one with the keypad and one without. I'm pretty sure but last I checked - not everyone is an accountant.",0
I have gotten was the screen bleeding once screen is dark.,0
(Great Laptop): I love the size of the screen and the quality of the picture. The initial setup was fast and easy and I am not at all familiar with Microsoft.,0
(Value): It was a great laptop for the money. I had an apple before. It wasn’t good as the Apple air. But it cost about 1/5 the price. Darn good deal,0
"(A fine piece of hardware): What I liked: Apple's construction quality is second to none. Unboxing this is a delight, it's just a beautiful machine. You can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done, which might take a few minutes. Love the display, bright colors, nice resolution, everything looks crisp. Keys are a delight to type with, real smooth. Battery life is the best I've ever witnessed, I just recharge this thing every other day, whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day (and I had for just one year).What I disliked: some of my favorite apps are still not ready for Apple Silicon or M1 chip. It's given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already. And coming from over 25 years using mostly Windows (and some 2-3 years using Linux) I feel like I have to rewire my brain to start using the fn, control, option & command keys properly.All in all, it's a really solid laptop although I feel like I still haven't made the most out of it. No heavy usage so far, except for some minor audio production work. Guess I'll do it eventually. Hope app compatibility gets better with time too, that's the reason for the missing star up there, otherwise, it would've been 5-stars all the way.",0
(For Moms Bday): My mother loved it for her bday.,0
"(good bang for your buck): Have only had it a short while but it runs smooth with every graphic intensive game I've thrown at it on ultra/high settings. It can get hot on the battery and the upper keyboard after an hour or so, but so will any laptop when gaming--hasn't effected the FPS. Screen and bottom part are both thin and lightweight, MSI does a good job keeping the screen border small so you get more viewing. Pleased with it so far. the gpu is the 85 watt variant.",0
