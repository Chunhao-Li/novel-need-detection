"Beautiful design, especially the rose gold edging",0
(Great Buy):,0
(Backspace key stopped working already. Just bought it in March): I loved it till the backspace key took a crap!,0
"(Warning! Windows 10 in S Mode installed on this Laptop!): Completely annoyed the sellers description did not mention this laptop comes loaded with version Windows 10 in S Mode. This nonsense version of Windows censors/restricts your downloads to ONLY those apps ""approved"" by the almighty Microsoft store. It specifically EXCLUDES the ability to download or install Google Chrome as your browser. You better be on-board with using Edge as your browser if you buy this. Solution? You must download MS Windows 10 PRO for $104 for the privilege of then being able to remove the restrictions on what you can or cannot install on your own PC. What nonsense. Had I known that in advance of ordering this, I would NOT have ordered this laptop as configured.",0
"(So far, so good! (Week 1 Review)): Overall, I'm super pleased with this laptop, and I am also really glad I went with the model that has the 16GB DDR4 RAM and the 512GB SSD storage space. The screen has great resolution, basically anything I've done on it is super fast, and for the price point, you're getting a lot of laptop.I'd heard that there were newer models of gaming laptops coming out later in Spring/Summer 2020, but with everything going on, I didn't want to wait, and I'm glad I found the Helios 300. Be wary of which version you are getting though, make sure you've done your research and you've grabbed the laptop with the specs you're wanting, otherwise you're going to have to upgrade this down the line.A solid plus to this computer is how up-gradable it is. There is an extra bay for a full sized SSD drive, so I certainly plan to get at least a 1TB drive to put in it. However, this does sacrifice the battery, and it certainly shows. This thing does not have much battery, and if you're using the neat RGB function on the keyboard, running the fans, and playing a game, the laptop is going to drain really fast. This isn't a major problem for me though, as I usually play plugged in, I just need the flexibility of moving around the house that a laptop can give over a desktop.One last thing, the 'turbo' fans on this thing are very, very loud. Not something I'd have on in the general living area of our house, but it does seem to keep the components cool!",0
(Returned): No sound nice Computer even if it says it’s renewed you whoever built it renewed it then put sound to it returned,0
(buena y atractiva): una pantalla facil de leer buenisimas condiciones etc,0
"(This is a really cool and a bit of a beautiful mess): So let's just cut to the chase. I like innovative different and unique ideas. As such, I wasn't unrealistic about the capabilities and limitations of so much hardware packed into a tiny space. For the most part, this unit delivers. When plugged into it's mobile dock, it can handle any graphics task you throw at it.The device is compact, similar to a microsoft surface, but dramatically thicker, which is to be expected. I'm quite disappointed in the window on the rear of the device. Yea, it's cool, but completely unnecessary. I would not mind it being there, other than it is not level with the rest of the device causing it to be uneven when placed on its back. That's just odd.The device reeks quality. The implementation is quite good. The battery life is meh. I'm used to a full-day of battery use from my surface. This, even at optimized settings will get you 4-5 if you're careful. So that cuts down on the portability to an extent.As far as performance, it's a bit buggy. I expect Asus to correct these issues over time with upgrades, but I've just had alot of weird, atypical issues. For example, the bluetooth stopped working for several hours and several resets, only to inexplicably start working again. I've had the unit freeze up, expecting to require a hard-reset, only to have it resolve whatever was causing the freeze and to go back to performing normally.But the BIGGEST disappointment by far is the keyboard cover. It looks and feels like the microsoft surface covver, with the same external quality, but WOW is this thing a wreck. I'm a mechanical keyboard fan, as I use my keyboard constantly, so I carry a small mechanical with me. But for paying $3,000, you would expect this thing to work. The keyboard just stops working Then starts again. And when you finally decide it is DOA, it comes alive again. I have yet to get a full day of the keyboard not completely malfunctioning. It's odd because the LED keys light up, but the keys simply won't work. Going into the device manager, you can see that there is some kind of USB error, which I'm positive is the keyboard, as it disappears once the keyboard starts working.Now..a warning. I have YET to figure out how to get service from ASUS on this keyboard issue. They have eliminated (to my knowledge) all direct chats and phone numbers, opting instead for a utility that supposedly gives a system check and, if it fails, will direct you to a chat to get help. Unfortunately, the utility doesn't recognize the keyboard failure. On the utility, you can reach out to chat, but NOWHERE in their list of products can this device be found, so you cannot proceed to chat with a Asus rep without it.What a terrible oversight when providing a $3,000 tablet!!! I have a mind to return it, as I can't figure out how to get service for the keyboard, but honestly, I don't use it much anyway other than to be a screen-protector.I hope this review helps you make a decision.",0
"(Great laptop!): Lightweight, beautiful screen, fast",0
"(Great little laptop for the basic computing needs): Great little laptop for the basic computing needs. Now that it has access to the Google Play Store, it is even better than before. The keyboard is not too small and I haven't had any freezing or crashing issues. It was extremely easy to set up and all my Google info synced up immediately. Really easy to to transfer data to the laptop as it has a micro SD card slot. Since I don't care too much about resolution, I do enjoy watching Netflix or Hulu on the laptop. I only really watch on the laptop when I'm out traveling, not for every day viewing. I recommend to anyone who just wants to browse the web, check e-mail or use when traveling.",0
(Touch screen nt working): Touch screen not working,0
"(Very good quality): The Legion 5 is a great laptop, with a well designed chassis, with a good cooling system and great performance. Howeve, the battery life is not spectacular.",0
(Review): I am very satisfied with my laptop. The price was well within my budget.Thank you,0
"(Do not buy. Never): Encourage you not to buy this item. The one I received came with an inherent defect. Fans are too loud and the laptop gets really quickly, which leads to horrible performance and FPS drop. The seller did not refund me full. Moreover, this cheap seller deducted money from me making me the one who damaged it. But I received the laptop damaged. Do not buy this rubbish guys, especially from this seller",0
(Again with the Cord): The plug broke in the machine... for the second time. Sending it back and won’t ever buy a Samsung because over and over they cheap out. Will be sending back as soon as I can get to UPS.,0
(Great for casual use): So far this laptop is great. It does glitch depending on how often you transition from only touch screen. Also does not have all the keys and takes a little time to get familiar with functions since it’s not like a typical laptop,0
"(Great, lightweight, and runs Linux like a champ.): After I got this, I installed Ubuntu Mate on it with no issues at all. Has been my daily travel laptop, replacingmy Chromebook. Haven't had any issues, and am more than happy with my purchase.",0
"(If you sick of Win10 constant upgrade/updates and constantly changing OS - this is the way to go, if it meets your needs.): First adventure into Chrome, husband (who is computer novice) was totally discusted with his slow and constantly changing Win10 system, so I got him one of these as it fits his needs perfectly. He is VERY happy with it.",0
"(Great laptop for the price): I needed an inexpensive laptop to do remote work. This solves my issue although I did add a an additional hard drive and more ram because I also edit video. For basic computer use, this was great. Did buy another one for my mother as well.",0
"(Great for everything): I love this laptop. Don't get windows 11. I found this laptop at a microcenter with a much better graphics card 3070 and a better battery life but I couldn't have it on hold as long as I needed to to go and get it. This computers battery is atrocious. Don't use while it's unplugged for a long time. It comes pre loaded with a lot of bloatware. I downloaded a third party application that makes it so that way you can lower the refresh rate to 60htz or your computer dies from full charge in 30 minutes. After making it so I can switch from 165htz -> 60htz the battery life lasts about 3 hours more. Like any other gaming laptop, it gets extremely hot. Oh and back to the refresh rate, this is advertised as 165htz which looks great but if you go to change it in window's settings, you can't change it to anything else. That's why I downloaded that other software. It's upgradable which is why I got it. I put in another ssd, of course you have to partition but it works perfectly. I put more ram in, and it's a beast, but with power distribution (because it's a laptop) the hardware will never be completely utilized to the fullest unless you overclock everything while plugged in. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE IT PLUGGED INTO IT'S GIGANTIC, HEAVY BRICK CHARGER IT'S COMPLETELY WORTH IT!",0
"(Good value for money Chromebook): A very good return for your money, fast and intuitive.",0
"(It died after only 8 months and they careless.): It died after only 8 months. I contacted customer service and they basically said sucks to be me.I buy lots of computers all the time, mostly because I prefer to have the newer better technology. I will never waist my money on another Razor or any computer they make. I can't believe it only lasted 8 months, I've never had that happen with any computer and I've owned almost every brand you can think of. Then to receive such poor customer service, removed any doubt.",0
"(This laptop works as advertised): This laptop is a good value, it works as advertised.",0
"(Affordable product comes with glitches): Ordered product in February 2019. Arrived quickly. After three months infrequent screen glitches occurring. Camera/webcam and microphone defective. Did not realize until end of March because had not tried to use before. Tried trouble shooting from web and contacting ASUS support, but no fix and will need to send back for servicing. Disappointing experience.",0
"(I feel like this is the best gaming laptop for this budget): I’ll keep it simple, i love the design, the specs are really good especially for this budget (i got it for 999$ on sale) and overall it is a great gaming laptop. Love it.No more upgrade for the next 4-5 years.",0
I noticed that the area next to the trackpad was dirty - as if someone had mud or dirt on their hands and touched that area.,0
It really has fine metal finished chassis and I love the way it looks.,0
"(My review): Using the laptop for a week. I am a student not a gamer so use it only for running code.It does the job for me, though there are some annoying issues.pros:Looks and feels good, runs fast. keyboard has nice feeling when typing.cons:The letters on the keyboard seem weird to me, used Lenovo before and prefer their design.The camera constantly blinking when used.When running code, sometimes there are lags in simple task such as adjusting volume or moving the mouse.",0
"(Muy bien el producto ?): La computadora está muy padre y a mi hijo, le encantó por ser muy rápida ..",0
"(It works): I like because is no heavy, I used for homework",0
"(Just keep it plugged in): This product was used by me as a replacement desktop cause it was way less expensive and movable.For the games I play which really aren't huge name titles, it works amazingly well. When the fans kick in, it really doesn't change the volume that much. Two things I'm kind of disappointed about was the storage and battery life. Because I use this as a replacement and not a daily driver for traveling, I keep the laptop plugged in and it works great. However, as soon as you remove the laptop from the power brick, you immediately notice how fast the battery drains. The other thing was storage. This version only has 256 gigabytes of SSD which as it turns out, isn't a whole lot. You can either get a different model for more with more overall storage, or you can buy this one and pay just for a cheap hard drive with storage space which is what I did. Speaking of, getting the back cover off is a pain, but the computer is great for upgrading",0
(Easy to operate): Personal,0
"(No issues): Had no issues. Product was fine, and shipping was quick.",0
The per key lighting is awesome.,0
"(Good for gaming): Overall impression its a great mid range laptop for the money. Highly recommend that you upgrade to 32G of ram first and foremost. Secondly I added a 2tb Samsung SSD along with another 2TB Samsung M.2 Drive. Laptop has connectors for the additional ssd slot along with one open m.2 slot. The laptop comes with 16g ( 2 x 8 ) so I ended up buying 2 x 16 crucial 3200 for a easy going price. Great PC, make sure you get yourself a cooling pad and you won't need to worry. Great build, CPU GPU.",0
"(What I was looking for!): Beautiful, hight-quality and light for travelling!",0
(Excellent computer): Completely closed and never used. Excellent but excellent laptop. Great investment,0
the temperature is not from the GPU but the CPU (over 90 Celsius spikes) that causes the fan to kick into turbo mode and super noisy,0
(watch out for warranty problems): just got this 2 weeks ago and the warranty date started in aug of 2021...so they have been sitting for 7-8 months. Submitted a ticket to have the warranty date changed...if they don't change it im sending it back.,0
(nice): Pretty good,0
"(Dependability): This was the second time I purchased this chrome book. Last was was several yrs old. I like it so I bought the same one and recieved it the end of February. Recently, the beginning of May I used it in the morning and it was fine. Later I turned it on and had some difficulty with the screen being distorted. There was no physical damage to my laptop and know reason why it should have an issue. I Contacted support who recommended sending my Samsung Chrome book to them for diagnostic repair. They recieved it and can fix it for a charge and claiming it is not covered under warranty. I had it less than three months and due to no fault of my own it does not work . I have always purchased Samsung products but will no longer. A very disappointed and dissatisfied customer.",0
(Complete Trash): Lasted two weeks before it presented with a blue screen error that said Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC. It can't do a system restore because it won't allow you to select the drive (even though it displays it) and you can't even reset the computer because that fails too.,0
"(Two Stars): I have had it for about a month and a half, and the keyboard already completely stopped working.",0
(Best value I have ever seen in a computer!): It’s amazing how much you get for your money with this. It is small - including the screen - but does everything I need.,0
(Light weight): Notebook was delivered with 8 MG RAM instead claimed 16 MB!,0
(slow and difficult to use): This computer freezes constantly. I used it for literally one day and it froze at least a dozen times. It's also not easy to use. I am returning this.,0
"(Came with Defective USB Ports, Details Below): Any USB device we plug into this thing won't so much as power on. At first, we proceeded to make sure that everything was up to date. We started with the USB drivers, then we went onto the support page for this model and updated the chipset and all other recommended drivers. We then confirmed that the BIOS was already up to date and even updated Windows 10 to its latest build.After all that, the problem still persisted. We checked our USB devices by trying them in 2 other laptops...they were working, no surprise there. We spent a few more hours researching the issue online and double checked that we did everything we could, including adjusting the relevant power management settings in Windows, but still nothing.We consider having functioning USB ports a big deal on this model, since it doesn't come with all that much storage, and you would likely want to use a USB device at some point when you're on the go. All in all, we had to spend 5 hours of our time just to confirm that the manufacturer sent us a defective unit.We're not even going to try and wrestle with ASUS and their customer support this time around. We've had a number of ASUS products fail in recent times and have never once gotten them to accept any kind of responsibility. We have always been patient and polite with their customer support, but they seem adamant in not wanting to fix or replace their products.From our interactions with them, it was also clear that the agents weren't reading through our support tickets properly, often resulting in long, drawn out conversations where we would have to ask them the same question over again, so that they could notice days later and eventually conclude that they can't do anything to help.It does sting a bit that we are loyal ASUS customers, easily having spent thousands of dollars on their products over the years, and right now, having that count for nothing. We definitely cannot recommend buying their stuff if that's how they treat customers, especially when the problem is with their product to begin with.",0
(like the big screen): Arrived with everything I needed to get started. Easy to set up and t use.,0
(Impressive): Arrived in a timely manner. Excellent customer service.,0
(Good quality): Excellent item. Well recommanded,0
(Excelente para tareas): Excelente para uso escolar o laboral,0
(Five Stars): Love it. 100% Recommended.,0
"(and at first I absolutely loved it. It is extremely small): I got the laptop, and at first I absolutely loved it. It is extremely small, lightweight, and fast. The 4k screen is insane on the 13 inch screen. I am typing this review on my old computer, because, 1 week into use, the laptop screen broke. I was using it for school, and one row of pixels down the center of the screen shut off, never to turn on again. I did a hard reset and everything I could think of to try to fix this issue, but nothing worked. I ended up having to pay $56 to ship the laptop to best computers, and after about 2 weeks I received a refund. It would of been a great laptop if it would have not broken 1 week into use.",0
This laptop would begin the same test at 50 and drop down into the low teens for WiFi connection.,0
these edges dig into your legs (if you are using it as a LAPtop) and it quickly becomes uncomfortable.,0
"(Quality is good and shipping time delay): I like the quality, packaging, are very goodShipping it dealy",0
"(Hardware malfunction causing blue screen error): I’ve had it for only 2 years. Hardware malfunction causing blue screen error every 5 mins. Troubleshooting is not helping, eventually found out it’s hardware error. Still looks very new because I’ve taken good care of it. Just disappointed!",0
"(Compact without compromise!): I love this chromebook. It has a premium look and solid build, and the power of the m3 processor ensures that everything runs super fast.I highly recommend this chromebook to anyone considering it, it really is a well thought out package.The S-Pen works quite smoothly too, I take a lot of notes by hand and this chromebook is up to the task.",0
"(Solid Company, Mediocre Laptop Model): 3-*from AZ-Shooter on June 18, 2020Solid State Drive provides quick start up. Top heavy screen makes for unbalanced and awkward use on knees/lap. Exaggerated battery life in the on-line description. Bluetooth and WiFi are solid. Internet connection set up was quick and easy.Pretty disappointing. I'd expect better for the price.Windows 10S is a bunch of restricted Google-centered baloney. It's good that a conversion to Windows 10 Home can be easily performed.The sound incredibly weak. Even my Android phone's sound has better volume. Even at full volume, the speakers (located on the underside of the bottom case) lack volume. This shows that even a good company can design a dud product.Despite the quick turn on/start-up and immediate program loading, the lackluster screen and the poor sound volume are sufficient for me to give a disappointing review.",0
"(Five Stars): Great computer, but had to return it for a reason that has nothing to do with the computer.",0
(Shame on HP): This Laptop on the first charge got extremely hot and so did the keyboard. So I gave it a second chance on the second day and the same thing happened again. Needless to say I returned the laptop for a refund! The only good thing out of this was that UPS came and got it from my home. Saved on Gas!!!,0
(Buy it now!): Amazing!,0
"(So close to perfect.): Just got this laptop and have been using it over the weekend. Forwarning, this may be long-winded.Update 10/6/2018: Still having touchpad failures, and now my bluetooth mouse is becoming disconnected. Turning the laptop's bluetooth on and off indicates the laptop is deciding not to see the mouse. Yet another problem with this computer. At this rate, I'll be unable to control the cursor with anything but the touch screen. Lowering the score a star.tl;dr/summary: Overall performance great. 4k monitor is the bees knees and also ankles. Style makes you look like a wealthy startup CEO. Obnoxious touchpad issues. Battery ""meh"". Runs hot but tolerable.First, of course is the display. 4k in a 15 inch screen is crazy. I can put my eyes up to the screen as close as I can focus, and can just BARELY make out the individual pixels. I bought this for photo editing so I think it will work well. I'm not quite sure on the color acuracy yet. Shortly after booting for the first time, I noticed the color temperature of the screen changed. I looked around everywhere for what might have caused it, but couldn't figure it out. Night mode wasn't on, adaptive bightness wasn't on, I don't get it. There is an Intel application for changing RGB hue and saturation, but it doesn't give the results I want. It's almost like the color temp of the backlight changed. Quite odd. Honestly though I wouldn't have noticed the change if I didn't see it happen. I am still confident that I'll be able to edit photos acurately. First thing I did when I booted up was open a white image to check for any dead pixels. All good!I briefly want to mention the color of this thing. Oh my god does it just ooze class. A bit of a fingerprint magnet, and the surface below the keyboard can look gross if you're typing (like I am right now), because the laptop is almost always warm and causes your palms to get a bit clammy. Thankfully, I'm not too picky about stuff like that and don't mind wiping it down every once in a while.Backlit keyboard is on point, and I like it just like the Asus laptop I used to own. They shine through under the keys with white, and the button lettering is like a light beige. I'm assuming if they tried to match the gold accents too closely, they would look like an ugly yellow. I think this color is quite good.Touchpad. I'll be honest, I have a huge problem with this thing. When moving the mouse around the screen, or scrolling, sometimes it just stops responding, or it will let me move up, but not down. I don't think it's lag, but for some reason it's just not registering my input. I ran through all the bases trying to troubleshoot this. Tried several drivers, checked to make sure windows gestures weren't interfereing, tried downloading Asus Smartgesture, tried cleaning it, and of course double checked that they didn't put some super-thin protective film on it. Still having the issue. I mean, I'm a mechanic by trade, but I by-no-means have grizzled old calused hands. I really don't think baby-soft fingertips should be a requirement for using the touchpad. This could probably be solved if there were a way to adjust the sensitivity of the pad. Asus customer support, I appretiate your assistance, but before you respond, I'm not talking about pointer speed. I mean the sensitivity of the touchpad registering an input. The sensitivity either needs to be increased, or give us a utility to increase it ourselves. That is, assuming that's the problem. My bluetooth mouse works flawlessly with no issues whatsoever, so it's undoubtedly a problem with the touchpad. Who knows, maybe it's just a problem with only my touchpad, but I really didn't plan on spending close to 2 grand just to immediately send it back, and possibly have the same issue. If anyone else has this problem, I would greatly appreciate if you commented and let me know how common it is. For now, it's not unusable, just occasionally quite frustrating.Battery. (update 9/18/2018: Have generated several battery reports that put the battery life around 4 to 4.5 hours of general web browsing and video watching) I haven't timed the discharge rate of it, but I'd put it around 5 hours just surfing the web and watching videos. Not great, but I'm by no means complaining. Driving a 4k monitor takes a lot of juice, and I probably wouldn't have an issue with the battery life unless it were under 4 hours. Bought this thing to be a powerhouse editor, and occasional light gaming computer. I would never expect to be able to to do those things all day on battery. That's just unrealistic. You might be able to increase battery life by setting a custom resolution of 1440, or 1080p, but I can certainly live with it right now.Noise/Heat. When I first booted the computer up, I was honestly surprised at all the noise it made. Fan noise is one thing, but this thing has so much coil whine when completing tasks that I took the bottom off to make sure I didn't get sent a unit with a traditional hard disk drive. Solid-state, and no moving parts aside from the fans, but this thing clicks and whines more than my $2500 desktop. It got a bit better once it wasn't constantly installing Windows updates in the background, but it's still there when under slight load. When you start to stretch it's legs, the fans spin up and sound like little jet turbines. A bit loud, but I wouldn't say obnoxious. In a busy environment, like a coffee shop, you probably couldn't even hear it. It definitely heats up though. The fans honestly do a great job at keeping the top of the laptop cool, but the cooling effects don't transfer to the bottom very well. When using it as a LAPtop, it will definitely keep you warm if you're taxing the system. It hasn't gotten so hot that I need to take it off my lap though. Handled Cities: Skylines okay so again I'm not complaining.Oh, SPEAKERS! Wow they're definitely the best laptop speakers I've heard, though it's not like I'm a laptop speaker tester. They have great bass that holds out until volume level 30-35 on Windows, after that, the bass stays the same and the treble just gets louder. For watching some netflix in your room, they're top notch. Playing some music while you clean your whole house, might want to get a bluetooth speaker. For entertaining a house party, that's a terrible idea and you're probably not a good DJ anyway.Overall, the touchpad thing is really my main gripe with this computer. My last laptop was an $800 Asus and I honestly had no complaints about it, so I was really expecting the trackpad to be much improved since the one I bought ~5 years ago.Can't think of any more topics to touch on, but please feel free to ask any questions. Not sure if Amazon sends notifications when someone comments, but I'll try to check every once in a while since I seem to be the only reviewer so far.",0
"(Looks New): A brand new elite book is thousands of dollars. When you unbox this one, you will think it was right off the assembly line. The quality is amazing.",0
"(Great Product): This is a great product. I've had a couple of HP towers, and this Chromebook is very fast and responsive. I would buy it all over again!",0
(Facts:): The product was received in good condition. Good size and also good quality. It worked well.,0
(Second one and it broke too): Purchased April of this year and it’s Sept it quit working last night. If I could give zero stars I would.,0
(W): Useless POS Windows 10 S mode (nanny mode) & you can't disable it. Will only run apps from Microsoft -- couldn't run Canon scanner/printer or allow me to install software for it -- only reason I bought it.,0
"(Stopped working a week after return time line. So disappointing): Lasted about 2 months, waist of money",0
"(Great buy. Powerful components): I especially like the cooling potential during high stress use. I had never seen so much vent area on a laptop. The battery life is a joke when using extreme performance mode. However, the battery holds up fine for browsing the internet for hours in battery saver mode. I like the per key rgb lighting. I can adjust both color and intensity of the keyboard. The portability is great and the number pad is a must for work.",0
"(Is it a phone? A computer? Doesn't know.): This computer doesn't know if it's a phone or a computer. Very difficult to use. Everytime I try to do something, like a spreadsheet for my home business, the only place you can save, if you are using Chrome OS, is in the Google 1 cloud-- not on the local computer. Gives me worries about stolen figures and personal data.",0
"(A good budget computer with a horrible display.): I'll keep this one short and simple: while the computer itself is good, the display on this machine is absolutely awful. I'm guessing it's a TN panel but let me tell you, it looks like it's straight out of 2011. If you aren't in desperate need for a computer, give this one a pass and go for something a little more expensive. Your eyes will thank you.",0
(No customer service): Brand new laptop and 2 keys already broken and no way to contact seller,0
(Awesome laptop): This computer is AWESOME!!! I was not sure to buy it on Amazon but I was wrong! It’s a awesome laptop it’s super fast and the graphics and downright beautiful.,0
(Cant download anything and vudu.com movies wont play): Beware if u use sites like VUDU.com. I have over 40 movies on VUDU but can't watch on this. Apparently according to Samsung you can't download any apps or movies even tho you tube is already on here.,0
(Good value): Gift,0
"this particular version must not be the ""Special Edition"" and as such does not come in the huge wooden box, or, more disappointingly, the nice suede laptop sleeve.",0
"(Excellent Value): got it for $850 on a pre BF deal. The screen is beautiful with a 144hz refresh rate. It has an excellent processor and graphics card which makes it great for gaming and for routine office work. My only gripe is with the battery life which is mediocre esp while playing games. The keyboard is white backlit, would be nice if it was RGB.",0
the pen is a fantastic addition,0
(Nice laptop): I am very satisfied with this lap top,0
"(Fantastic products！): I upgraded from MBP2018 15"" to MBA 2020 , simply too good value, much lighter in weight, but the running speed is actually my old computer is still very smooth too, the screen improvement is obvious",0
"(Charger doesn’t stay in, zoom and Netflix don’t work): This chromebook is awful. First of all, the charger doesn’t even stay in. Even when I’m level to the group, it won’t even stay in—it only charges if I’m literally holding it into the port with my hand.Secondly, Netflix and Hulu and any other streaming sites don’t work properly. At first, they didn’t load at all. I updated the chromebook twice and finally the videos would load — except, it was SO glitchy. And it’s not because of my internet connection. It’s because of this chromebook. Zoom meetings are also very glitchy and I fear that it’ll crash one day because apparently it’s too much to handle for this chromebook. My last chromebook worked so well with Netflix, Hulu and zoom. That one ate the dust when my dog spilled coffee on it and I thought this one would do well but I was very mistaken. I will be returning this in hopes of finding a better laptop.",0
(Great little laptop): Ordered this for my kids to do learning games and websites on it. So far on PBS kids website it is working out perfect. Some people complain about the screen but I think its great for the kids. I kinda want one for myself to download games from google on it lol. For the price you can't beat it. I was originally wanting to get them a desktop (ages 5 &7) but came across this affordable laptop and couldn't pass it up. They are really loving it and it goes super fast! We aren't planning to add anything to it.. Only for educational purposes only :),0
Everything runs so well and the design is so sleek,0
"(Great for tethered VR experiences): I really liked this computer, until it stopped working. I've owned it for 15 months now and I thought I'd leave a review. The performance is solid. I installed Windows 11 with no issues. However, after a while, I noticed some performance issues that affected the whole computer, as well as poor sound quality. I thought it was Windows 11, so I installed Ubuntu. The problems still persists on Ubuntu. I believe that I have a hardware problem. Right after the warranty expired. How nice. I didn't like the screen quality on this computer, but it's better than my previous laptop, so it may just be the state-of-the-art and I'm just unfamiliar with laptop displays. I never had memory or performance issues (other than the freezing described above) with it, though. It's also very fast.",0
(Perfect): exceeded my expectations i loved better investment.,0
(Nice laptop): BOUGHT for my DadHe loves it,0
"(PRETTYYYY GOOOD): Honestly, I know absolutely NOTHING about computers. I have only had a chunky old microsoft something or another in like 2007 that didn't even connect to the internet. In senior year of high school we had chrome books, and those were so simple to use. When I got this computer, it was intimidating and I struggled to figure it out. BUT even without support of microsoft amazon or hp I was able to fix the error code myself. The screen display is beautiful, bright, and perfect for me. I can't wait to see how it does for my college courses and sims! I recommend it. It's a perfect size, and VERY sleek girllllll (or guy I won't discriminate lol)!",0
"($1500 Brick): I bought this laptop at the end of March of this year, without having used it much until recently. It required Windows updates as well as driver updates. A few days ago, when I went to boot it, all I received on the screen was a ""Republic of Gamers"" logo. I restarted it multiple times, and received the same thing every time. There is no way to access BIOS, and now I have a nice $1500 brick. I will be contacting ASUS tomorrow to get on with my warranty, and will update as the process goes along. To say that I am less than pleased with this product is an understatement.Update 7/29:The SSD failed and was replaced. I've had it for about a week and haven't had any issues so far as I can tell. The warranty process took a couple weeks and if it was my only computer I'd have been far more upset than what I am. I will continue to use it and give a better review after I've had it for some time.",0
(Had this6 Months so far.. LOVE IT): Its a great computer.. Its for gaming I think but I run my business off of it as I do some photoshop and wanted more performance...I like it!,0
"(Great device- probably my best computer ever.): Light, easy to use, fast, easy transition from a life of windows devices.",0
(Windows): Windows conflicts with the laptop consider changing it to windows 10 and maybe upgrading the network card as it isn't that great otherwise very good machine,0
wouldn't get past the Blue Setup Screen,0
(Good product): Good quality,0
"(Returned it, issues with the battery): I returned it. I had issues with the battery after two weeks of having it",0
"(Practical solution for most people): I switched to Chromebook a about three years ago. This is my second Chromebook and is a replacement for a Toshiba Chromebook 2 that was damaged. This thing does everything I need a laptop to do. It has long battery life. I can stuff it in a backpack and use it overnight without charging. I can watch several Netflix movies on it and still have juice left to check email and do other basic tasks. The screen is nice and bright. It isn't as sharp as my Macbook Air, but after you start using it you don't even notice. The keyboard is not bad. Again, after using it a little while you won't notice anything's different. I use the Google Drive for storage so very little gets stored on the laptop. But if you need more storage you can put in a cheap 32GB MicroSD card and you'll have plenty of space. About the only thing I haven't been able to do with the Chromebook has been editing photos. But, I recently got Snapseed on this machine and now I can edit just about any photo to my satisfaction.Overall, if you are like most people and just need a laptop for routine tasks like email, surging the web and viewing online media, this thing can't be beat for the cost.",0
"(It’s what you get for the price, it very good.): It’s the best budget gaming computer",0
(No cords in the box): No power cords were included and there was no mention that the cords needed to be purchased separately. I had to purchase a power cord,0
"beautiful, clear, and colorful screen with touch capability",0
(Nice travel computer): Works well.. looks good.. good travel size..,0
"(Happy with it after a few settings changes): Loving it so far but the auto adjusting screen brightness is super annoying. You have to go into the BIOS (hold delete on startup) then click setup bios > display and turn off adaptive brightness and that fixes it. If the webcam was on top of the screen and with this settings fix, it would be a pretty perfect machine. Will update after having it for a bit.",0
"(Decent mid tier gaming laptop): This laptop should never come with anything smaller than 12GB RAM. But if you do get this with 8GB ram, buy ram and add it. 8GBs make it impossible to run multiple programs or even one game and chrome without significant frame drop and lag.The ultra-fan setting works pretty well despite how loud it is.The laptop will let you run most online mmorpgs at 30 FPS with medium settings. Will barely run graphics heavy games like Tera, BDO, and most AAA games.It does however, work pretty decently for F2P games like CS:Go, TF2, Valorant, LoL.The camera is absolute garbage whether or not you can get a decent webcam software and comes preinstalled with a crappy program that will almost seem like adware.Battery life is decent and the computer doesn’t get too hot with general usage.",0
"(2 HUGE flaws!): The battery life is great! Maybe the most redeeming quality. I personally like the way the backlit keyboard feels (layout and key travel). Performance is also great with the 8th gen CPU and SSD. Boots up and off in less than 10 seconds. Very portable and sleek looking.CONS:There are TWO very big cons I have!!!The screen has good specs for the price and it shows it. HOWEVER, the screen FLICKERS very often. Ive tried resetting the drivers and even deleted ALL foreign apps the laptop didn't come with. Still happens and it's only gotten more frequent. The TOUCHPAD stutters and STOPS RESPONDING every 15-20 minutes. Using the laptop is very difficult with this flaw.",0
"(The core processor): The i3 processor is pretty slow for a laptop around this price range, quite sluggish.",0
(works great): i got this for my mom she likes it and says its very nice,0
"the laptop got painfully hot, and worst of all the lag.",0
"(My purchase): I am happy with what I got,so far..,.",0
(Groovy pc bro): Very fast but low quality sound,0
(Price is right): Screen could be better but for the price it is great. Last one I had lasted years.,0
"(Edit: My Bad.): I just received my package and wanted to immediately upgrade the hard drive. Much to my utter shock, the most important piece of the laptop was missing, the hard drive. It was just empty there, nada. I have called the customer support for help and they have transferred my claim to another department, so I will have to wait 2-3 business days for that call. It sounds pretty crazy but this is where I am right now. I paid this much money to have such an important piece of hardware missing.*Edit Turns out that empty space is for you to add additional memory. Heads up to you non tech savvy buyers. Don't freak out that part is empty. It works and has an SSD, a different form of memory.",0
"(Good performance overall buuuuuut......): The laptop's performance is good for running games that require strong specs/ hardware but the only downside to this is the battery life. The battery life on this laptop is extremely bad. It starts dying at a rapid rate when the only application/ task running is Google Chrome. Laptop's are supposed to be portable but how is that supposed to happen if the laptop's battery only lasts about two hours. For now, I will just keep it plugged into the outlet.",0
"when playing video games, the fans run even at higher speeds, w/o pressing on the area it will make that weird sound and will be really loud when pressed on",0
(Five Stars): Perfect,0
(Best laptop out there.): Best thing I've ever bought on amazon. Beats the crap out of my friend's gaming DESKTOP he built for the same price.,0
"(Smells like a damp, musty basement): Not sure where these laptops were stored but the musty smell was overpowering when I opened up the box. The main culprit was the power cord. I went online to find a solution and found multiple complaints about this model’s cord. LOVE the computer….hate the cord smell. Luckily it stays charged so long that I can put it in another room to charge every 3rd day.",0
(Espectacular): Excelente,0
"(Works very well.): As with any chromebook, it is great for most users.",0
"(I like pc/laptops, I also really like gaming): I like pc/laptops, I also really like gaming, smash those together and it creates this. I really like this laptop, It gets the job done!",0
The speakers are located at the bottom of the laptop which tends to muffle the already lackluster audio coming from this product,0
(It is a great computer for the money): I love it.,0
"(Nice laptop with lots of memory): After setting up my account on the OTVOC laptop I turned it off to reboot it and was immediately impressed, as it only took 14 seconds to boot up and ready for my password. The system comes loaded with Windows 11, with a free trial offer for Microsoft office. The 15.6 inch screen truly has 15.6 inches of viewing area with great quality when watching 1080p video. Conversely, the speaker isn’t the greatest, but probably what one should expect from a laptop computer. One reason I purchased this laptop was for the 512 GB solid-state hard drive, which I found has 510 GB of memory, with only 35 GB consumed by the operating system and apps, resulting in 475 GB of free space. The mouse pad is large, which is some thing I will need to get accustomed to when typing, but I found the sensitivity of it to be set up appropriately. Overall, for the cost, this is a very nice laptop with 512 GB SSD memory that meets my needs very well.",0
(Four Stars): A very nice lightweight laptop that does everything I need it to do at a very affordable price,0
"(Simple): It was a gift for my cousin so not sure about the gaming. But, I was able to set it up for him and had no problems. I think he will like it and it will help him thru his college courses just fine :)",0
"(Screen Not Ready for Primetime): I'd love to give this laptop a better review, but I can't, because it never got past the initial setup. The first one I received within a couple of minutes had numerous discolored vertical lines in a two inch slice of the screen, which persisted through reboots and were visible in BIOS and in a separate boot environment. The replacement I received looks to have been previously returned based on the manufacturer tape being split and covered with regular shipping tape, and it too had a screen issue. Backlight bled up from the bezel, which may not be a dealbreaker if this was a $300 laptop, but I'm not paying $1800 for a laptop with a screen with ANY defects.Once is a fluke, two in a row is probably indicative of a manufacturing problem.I have an existing Asus ROG laptop and have used Asus parts for numerous gaming desktops, but this quality control issue is seriously worrying. I would not recommend buying this for another generation or two.",0
(Delicate screen): Have started observing spots and lines in my screen within months of purchase,0
The low bezel screen looks gorgeous and feels solid.,0
(Funciona a la perfección.): Totalmente nuevo.,0
"(Very good according to its price!!): The equipment is very good according to its price, it has 2 slots for ram memory, and 1 additional option to install a hard disk. I like it. But the screen resolution is not very good.",0
"(Not as described, but has some strengths.): In terms of performance per dollar, this is a pretty nice machine. There's not a lot of other devices where you can get a quad core 7th gen processor and a GTX 1050 for 800 dollars.But some of the information on the product page is a downright lie. It does not have a 178 degree viewing angle screen. In fact, it's one of the worst displays I've seen in a laptop in a decade.It does not have an Aluminium unibody. The lid and palm rest sections are made of a thin sheet of aluminium, strapped to a mostly plastic frame. Overall, the construction is cheap.Overall, this is an average machine that would have been a good buy if not for the misleading information provided that had me expecting something even better.If you want something that can do double duty for work and gaming, and can manage a screen with washed out colors and bad viewing angles, it's a good purchase.For just about anything else, there are better options.",0
"(Will probably only last you a year if you use it often): EDITED: It's been 11 months since I've had this computer. It just snapped in half this morning while opening it. The plastic that the hinges are screwed into apparently crystallized. So, it is certainly not a durable computer. I won't be another ASUS.It's everything that I needed. Fast, great specs and affordable. The only cons are that the speakers are really low, and that it gets really noisy if you try to use it on your lap while it's charging. I would buy again and recommend. If you're considering this laptop, get it!",0
(Super fast): This is the fastest laptop I have ever used. Video quality is amazing and it has enough storage on its 512gb SSD to hold all my games and videos. A must buy for gamers at a price that doesn’t break the bank. I will buy another as a gift for my husband.,0
(Price and quality): My grandson loves it for school. It was a great deal.,0
"(5 months in, already dead.): Well here we are 6 months later. The laptop stopped charging or working about a month ago. I’ve tried to find other chargers for it and that didn’t work either.",0
(Mother board problems): Bought one year ago..mother board went out 3 days ago. Unable to repair according to technician.,0
"the 6th month comes around, the screen just loves to black out frequently.",0
(Battery life is a bust): I’m enjoying this laptop but the battery life is the worst of any tablet or laptop I’ve ever owned.,0
(Not easy to apply): Not easy to apply. I still have bubbles that I can't get rid of in the corner. You'll have to be fairly experienced with applying these kind of things to get it perfect.,0
"(Warranty): We took out the extended warranty on this computer, never received any paperwork. Does it come from Dell ?",0
(Returned for credit): It was a very old computer that had lots of wear.,0
"The introduction of computers with holographic display technology is truly a game-changer. Imagine the capability to project 3D holograms that you can interact with in real-time. This innovative feature is poised to revolutionize various sectors, including design, gaming, medical imaging, and education.",1
I also received a gift card from them,0
Fans get really loud while gaming so better to use headphones.,0
It is blazing fast with the intel 720p 512GB and a 2tb for mass storage.,0
(Great Laptop): This laptop is amazing and well worth the buy. Its great for everything from casual everyday stuff to high end gaming.,0
"(Web Cam from WW1 😒): This laptop is beautiful and works very good but the web camera is so bad you cant even imagine, the quality image is so poor and it runs at 480p/60hz, i attached two reference pics for comparison, one of the actual laptop and the other one of a very old computer. Pd Im a computer geek, so trust me. Also dont mind my ugly face 🤪",0
(Not bad for the money . Just a cheap everyday laptop . But a few little personal issues): Not a bad laptop for the money and dose all I need being as I do not game.Screen is of reasonable resolution and brightness only odd things is for the best viewing it seems to need to be at a larger angle than you would expect.System responds quickly and battery life I would say is avg and lasted about 3 1/2 hours for me under full load streaming HD video. The volume seems a bit low but that might be because they are under the laptop.Note! This is a USB-C 3.1 and not 3.2 and will NOT display videoThere are a few personal issues.FIRST the microSD slot is not the kind that you fully insert the card into so it sticks out. This for me at least is annoying as I use a 256GB microSD for storage.The SECOND issue is only if your going to run Ubuntu. The laptop uses Intel Rapid Storage Technology and that needs to be disabled. When you change it in the BIOS windows will not boot since it can no longer find the C drive. I ran thru the steps to try and correct this however that failed so I had to reset windows completely after I disabled RST in the BIOS. So if you are going to run Ubuntu do that before you do anything with windows as you will have to reset it.,0
The laptop came in a nice sleek box and a nice fabric sleeve.,0
"(A great overall laptop but not perfect.): There are a few minor problems.The USB-C port on this laptop doesn't support display output. The model with the intel chip does. Additionally, the type C port doesn't support charging. It's for data transfer only.The placement of the charging port can be inconvenient when plugging in other accessories, as the cable blocks the other ports. (Video Provided)If you can look past those issues, the laptop is great.The screen is bright and vibrant since it's an OLED display. There is software to allow pixel shift to avoid burn in, so the display should last a long time.The keyboard is responsive, backlit, and has a number pad.Fingerprint reader works well. There was only one time when the drivers for it turned off by itself, but that was a simple fix, and it hasn't happened since.The trackpad is large, responsive and feels great.The webcam is decent and has a privacy shutter.I'm able to get 6 to 7 hours of battery life from a full charge on an average work day. My results are based on balanced mode with brightness around 60%. If you lower brightness and optimize for battery efficiency, you can definitely get more out of it.Charging is fast on the included charger.I've only played a few games on it so far, but I'm able to run modern games at medium settings at 60fps. Older games like Tomb Raider 2013 and Assassin's Creed 2 run 60fps at high graphics.",0
"(vERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE): I bought this laptop three years ago and never had a problem with it until recently, but then the sound started to go, and I contacted the maker about it, and unlike Microscoft they have refused to get on line and take remote control of my computer and fix thee problem. I have tried to fix the probem myself but no avail. This company doesnt even have a 1-800 number to contac them directly or any sort of number in fact, i had to communicte with them through facebook messager. Its been a good laptop for all the 3d modeling and animation ive been doing, but ASUS's customer service is by far the worst I have ever encountered. Its just a shame they make a great laptop and yet refuse to offer any kind of decent customer service for when things go wrorng with it.",0
"I run hard Cuda workloads, so I need a fast machine with an NVIDIA GPU.",0
"(Not really Refurbished): ...at least in my opinion, a cheesy job. Excess wear has been literally masked over with vinyl covering. Arrived dirty. Power supply looks new, but is running really hot.Also, there is confliting information in product claims. Just to be clear, youre NOT receiving a 2018 machine, it is NOT 2.9ghz, and it is NOT as pictured.",0
The laptop was well packaged,0
(Best chrome book): Solid,0
(Great choice for a laptop): Love the quality of this laptop and for a very reasonable price! Only con is the battery doesn't last long.,0
"(Alexa build-in? Higher price????): I like the laptop very much and planned to buy it for my son’s Christmas gift, but the price just keep on increasing and I start to think if there is other options. I have decided to just build a pc since it is cheaper and have a better performance anyway. I am leaving a comment to remind the buyers to see if the price keep on increasing then just buy the i7 one instead. The i7-9750h (way faster cpu) come with gpu rxt 2060 (bang on the money) and 16 go of ddr4 ram (no upgrade needed.) Only thing is to add another ssd or hhd (2tb recommended.) Hope if this help!",0
It has a powerful four-core Intel processor,0
"(Works Well, No Issues): I got the ASUS gaming laptop for my young son who likes playing various games like Roblox, Fortnite, and Mine craft, etc. I figured it also would be useful for him to have as a backup for working on school projects and other research since he could take it with him wherever he goes.The ASUS laptop seems well built and very sturdy. It was easy to set up and get going, even for the people with just basic computer skills. My son really likes the multicolored keyboard and the graphics quality and processing speeds have been adequate for his gaming needs.We've been using the laptop for several months now and don't have any complaints. I had recently purchased a Lenovo desktop computer, which started having software related issues just weeks after using it. Despite consistently updating the audio driver and software from Lenovo and software from Windows, our desktop computer continues to have occasional audio issues and will freeze during use. I was worried I might experience the same with this laptop after my history of computer problems. Very happily, I do far have not had any issues to report with the ASUS laptop, which is a relief to me because I am not tech savvy and reading or watching Youtube videos until I can try to find a fix is not my idea of a fun time.In summary, my son and I have been very pleased with the ASUS laptop and I'm glad we got it.",0
(NO RAM): Its a nice laptop but its extrmely slow. Should give the option to increase ram.,0
(Death of screans): NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!! I have purchased 2 of this model first one screen lasts 4 months. The last one screen lasts 20 minutes.NO MORE HP FOR ME,0
(A very good overall laptop): Well I have done a lot of research before I bought this laptop and let me tell you that after months of searching for something in the same budget there is nothing that comes close to this laptop. The screen size was an important factor for me. I have only had the laptop for about 3 days now and I work on it mostly for video editing and till now it's perfect. Just a heads up I had to install a new copy of windows 10 Because the version it came with was lagging and full of bloat ware.,0
(Easy to use. I really like this chromebook!): I didn't like moving the cursor around with my fingers. That is why I bought myself a wireless mouse. It is easier for me since I am older and used to a mouse. Otherwise I love it. Wanted to use it for ancestry.com. So much better to have a larger screen (15.6) than a small one that I was using on my Kindle.,0
Battery life is decent for the specs.,0
(Great product): Great little computer for my 9 year old!,0
(Pretty decent): Good value for the price but the graphics are not the greatest and some apps can be glitchy. The battery life is great and it’s easy to use. The touchscreen works fine.,0
"(Powerful little laptop!): I have purchased 2 of these little laptops for myself and my boyfriend. Overall the laptop is amazing! It's very thin and lightweight, the screen is huge, and is appealing looks wise. It's very fast, and seems to be a pretty powerful little computer. We absolutely love these and are so glad to have purchased these.There is only one thing that I reeeeaaaally can't stand. The speakers are on the BOTTOM of the computer, so even when the volume is turned up to 100 it always sounds muffled...even on a tabletop surface.But, other than this minor thing we highly recommend these.",0
"(Perfecta Laptop): Excelente, es muy rápida justo lo que necesitaba",0
"(Nice laptop): Had it for about a month now - so far so good. Tons of battery life, thin, bright clear screen, fast processor. Not ""overly"" loaded with bloatware - the few programs I didn't want were easy to get rid of. As with all windows products they try to get you to open a microsoft account as you go through the setup process but you can choose to skip it at each step, so no problem there, just a minor annoyance. If you want MS office it only comes with the trial version, but I still think that for the money this laptop is an excellent value.",0

"(Great laptop!): This computer is light and has a huge screen with decent graphics that is perfect for work or streaming movies. Setup is extremely easy, you get guided by Cortana's voice through the process. After you setup an account you will be free to use your new laptop however you want. It has a an Intel Core i5 8th Gen processor that delivers quick online searches and streaming.",0
"(A good computer for the money.): I'm a HP fan. Since my current Pavilion dv7-6b55dx Entertainment laptop is nearing its life expectancy, I wanted to replace it before serious issues occurred. The new Pavilion is comparable to my older model, but much faster. However, all computers slow down with age. The old Pavilion seemed lightening fast when I first got it. It's a fair replacement. However, there is one issue that is a major disappointment. The battery is internal and not removable. Since I use this computer for my business, in place of a desktop, I like to remove the battery and keep the laptop plugged in 24/7. This is not possible with the new Pavilion. So, I have to use it till the battery runs down and plug it in again, Then repeat. Bummer! Also, the case is flimsy compared to my older Pavilion. Much lighter gauge plastic. Really don't expect the new Pavilion to last nearly as long as the old one",0
"It's a great keyboard, great design, great performance.",0
I love the ratio of the display and how comfortable the keyboard is when you type.,0
"(Nice Laptop): This is a nice laptop, runs clean, after first opening it, it stalled a few times, updated it though and everything is fine. Hoping this is good enough to do image editing. One problem I have with it so far is it has this thing called Lenovo Vantage and it is a great program to keep your laptop healthy but it does not show me what it fixed after it supposedly fixed something. I also get this annoying pop up asking me to pay for it and apparently it is free in the Microsoft store. I will have to remove this Vantage and download the free one in the Microsoft store. I do not know why it keeps asking me to pay for it when it states it is completely free.Only time will tell if this laptop will serve me well or not. I will come back to up date my review if I run into any problems. So far its fine. The price could have been better but the hardware for these laptops are not cheap these days.",0
(Easy to use): Very easy to set up and use,0
"(Easy Editing): This is the first Apple computer I've ever had and I adore my Mac. I originally bought it for editing my videos for my YouTube channel (Rae of Sun Asmr) which is still its main function. Now however, I almost prefer watching things like Netflix, etc. on here vs on my actual television. Picture quality on this thing is superior. Highly recommend.",0
"(Awesome Chromebook for a Great Price): Super fast shipping! I ordered at 1am and it arrived at 7:40pm the same day, I selected free 2 day shipping so I was pleasantly surprised. The laptop worked just fine straight from the box. I just turned it on and signed in to my Google account. It's very simple to use and fits my need for a school use laptop. I love the selection of Chrome extensions and apps. I'm in college and also use this for homeschooling my daughter. I use Google classrooms, which works great on this Samsung Chromebook. It's fast and user friendly. I have an hp desktop I use for gaming and other heavy duty stuff. This laptop is perfect for on the go lessons and homework. It is refurbished, but looks new and works like new.",0
(Had to return): Don't know if it was just mine but the very 1st day the screen started fizzing up and continued so I'll just have to return it and maybe go with something more familiar like hp or dell.,0

"(Dropping Wifi - awful unreliable rubbish.): We've had the Chromebook only a short few weeks, and already we're having problems with it. The Wi-Fi keeps on cutting out, and refusing to reconnect without a restart. A Chromebook without WiFi is pretty pointless. Looking to return.",0
(Stupid): Cant even see if I like the laptop cuz I cant seem to find a charger that fits. Why would you send some one a laptop with no charger,0
(Great Laptop): Been very surprised by the quality and power. Only complaint is you have to have it plugged in or the graphics and processing power sucks.,0
"(Slow): Runs very slow, and loud. Have a difficult time doing simple things like browsing a web page. Do not recommend. You can get a better laptop than this for half this price.",0
(Just right!): Perfect for the price,0
"(Great for gaming, but terrible Razer quality control.): Pros:I got my Blade in the 144hz, GTX 1070 version and I loved it. It is very fast and does everything I need it do. I use it at school for homework and such, and it is fine (only lasts for an hour or two without being plugged in). At home when it is plugged in, I can play GTA V no problem and get a consistent 110 frames per second. I also get a constant 110 FPS on games like Beam NG Drive. I easily get 200 FPS playing CS:GO on max settings too. I use the G-Sync so it only displays 144 FPS, and I do get 144 FPS on Minecraft and CS:GO.Cons:However, the speakers had a weird glitch where they sounded absolutely terrible, I recorded a video and it sounds like they are underwater. It sounded better when I turned off Dolby Atmos, but another issue was the charger. It broke and stopped charging my laptop, and I had to replace the entire order because I couldn't replace just the charger. I got a replacement laptop of the same exact type, but it has a dead pixel and the speakers cut out and in randomly when playing games. Oddly enough, this doesn't happen when I watch videos or listen to music, just gaming sessions like heists in GTA or long rounds of CS:GO. I already sent back my original laptop, and will send this one back too. Hopefully, third time is the charm, and I get a Blade with no quality control issues. The battery life is also pretty bad and lasts less than 3 hours at school, but if you bring a charger it is fine.The quality control should not be such a huge issue, but Razer has had this problem in the past and a lot of Razer Blade buyers have issues with quality control. It sucks that I spent $2,400 on a laptop to have to send it in and now i have to send the replacement in too.",0
(As good or better than expected): This does what I wanted it to do....,0
"(Great gaming machine): I bought this laptop for my wife, with whom I and other family and friends will often play online games. She was not entirely sure why I felt the need to give this to her since her experiences with laptop gaming had always been substandard, but I insisted that her work laptop needed replacing anyway and it was a decent price. She relented and neither of us have had any reason for regret since. The speed and power of this slick little machine is impressive for its cost point. It has also changed her gaming habits and she is much happier for it. The one thing that we have noticed is that the fan whines a little on the loud side when gaming, but it hasn't bothered my wife at all because it's not loud enough to be heard through her headphones while gaming. Everything else including its size and profile has just been lovely.",0

"(Great Laptop....But......): I was in the market for a laptop, as I felt it was time for an upgrade. Being a retired IT professional, I needed a laptop where I can use my 4K drone footage for video editing...and do some gaming as well. I knew what specs I wanted and what I was willing to pay...even if there was a trade off between specs and affordability.I also read and watched umpteen rated reviews and based on those reviews and while there are MANY gaming laptops out there, I decided on purchasing the Acer Predator Helios 300.The specs on this bad boy are excellent and fitted my requirements, everything works as it should, meaning that I have no issues with performance with hardware or software.Below are, in my opinion, pros and cons of this laptop -PROS -Price - $1183.00 (at the time of purchase) Value for money!!CPU speed is lightening - i7 Octa-core Intel ProcessorWindows 10 - Free upgrade to Windows 11Dedicated GPU - nVidia GeForce RTX 3060RAM - 16gigs DDR4HD - 512GB SSDBattery - 58WattsBuild Quality - Alluminum cover and keyboard chassis - ExcellentWiFi capability - IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/axLAN - Gigabit EthernetBluetooth 5.1Webcam - 720PPorts - USB Type-C port: USB 3.2 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps), DisplayPort over USB-C, Thunderbolt 4, USB charging 5 V; 3 AScreen - 15.6"" FHDRefresh Rate - 144HzUpgradeable - Extra 1 SSD & 1 HD slot availableRBG Keyboard with 4 zone lightingPredator Sense Software is greatTurbo Boost ButtonNumber Pad at the sideAlexa built-inCONS -Weight - 5.1 LBSFingerprint Reader - NoSD Card Reader - NoTouchscreen - NoBuild - Bottom of laptop has a plastic coverSome BloatwareMost importantly - Battery Life - Horrendous (I got about 2 hrs with light computing)Like I stated, I was willing to make compromises/trade offs on what was important to me in purchasing this laptop. I knew that I needed/wanted a fast CPU and a dedicated GPU, with at least 16gigs of RAM, great quality build with a decent enough gamut range for my video/gaming requirements.My trade off are with the battery life and SD Card Reader. Most gaming laptops are NOT noted for good battery life, as the power that's required to push the CPU, GPU and the screen's refresh rate, well, the battery is going to suffer. With that in mind, I knew that portability wasn't going to be an issue, as I would rearly use the laptop on battery power....as the laptop will be connected to the power supply (230W AC power adapter), so that really didn't impact my decision. For the SD Card reader, well, that did, as my drone uses a Micro SD card, but since there's the Thunderbolt 4 port that comes with the laptop, I would just purchase a card reader and connect it to the port and that too would be solved.Overall, this laptop is powerful, the specs proves that, but again...everyone's requirements are different from person to person, so do your research and make a decision that suits YOUR NEEDS as this suited mine.Hope this information helps and thanks for reading my review.Note - Now I have to find a way to get the Acer Predator Helios 300 away from my daughter...lol...she's the REAL gamer in the family.",0
(Gaming is not limited at all!): fantastic laptop highly recommend,0
(Great quality & value): Love the price and quality. Is working as if brand new.,0
(Was what I ordered): Great item,0
(Five Stars): excellent product.,0
"(Don't use this third part company): This item is garbage, my son is a student and the computer won't allow him to go onziom because it has a micro dot and added to it .ad my companies IT look at the computer. They said it is impossible to take it off and go on regular zoom. My son has already missed two zoom, college classes. He used his loan money to get a computer. The reply I got from the company is that it is my problem not there .They are so rude.",0
I like that there is a physical switch to turn off the internal camera.,0
(Connection problems): Is this a new laptop? It keeps logging me out of the internet. It’s happened so many times since I bought it. Can you please advise. I’m thinking of returning it.,0
(A1): A1,0
(Came in excellent condition. No problems yet. 4 Months.): Good value for money. I bought it as a machine for my teenage child to do homework and study with and its pretty good.,0
(Screen freezes): Within a few minutes of starting a game the laptop freezes and has to be manually restarted. Happens multiple times before I can actually play a game.I'm still searching for a solution.,0
it would've been great if it came with the Ethernet USB dongle and the USB type C charger,0
"(Great gaming laptop but too expensive): This is a great gaming laptop but it’s not worth the price, just get a desktop pc for 1500 dollars and absolutely 100% better",0
"(Fast boot-up time): Fast boot-up. ... Using crouton i installed Ubuntu 16, but there were problems, so i deleted Ubuntu and installed Kali-rolling which works. But with Kali i get (so far) no audio. For now, i don't need audio. Kali does work with USB peripherals like the HackRF and the Yardstick One.",0
(Great Laptop for the Price): Can't speak to battery life - haven't tried using it for long period on battery. Great for casual internet and streaming use. Bought mainly as it came pre--loaded with Windows 11.,0
(Great product @ a great price!): Very good!,0
(Gift to my wife. She loves it!): I gave it to my wife for communicating with her friends.,0
(Really nice): Perfect!,0
"(It is amzing): For one thousand dollars you can get a lot of great powerful machines that offer 2070 GPUs. Thought this machine doesn't have that high end GPU the trade off is quite fans, and smooth running games that never heat up the system. Lenovo hardware is built to last. If you are looking for a laptop that can game and works well for being a student this is the perfect fit. If you want the most powerful system go for a custom built PC as I have seen and worked with many Laptops that have ridiculous components only to overheat and be unusable. great quality great price",0
"(Great bang for buck): I've used this laptop a lot for gaming. I've had this laptop for almost 2 months now, and the cooling system is really great. I can play max graphics on the games I play (League, Valorant, Fortnite), get amazing fps, and my laptop is as cool as a cucumber. The only thing to be aware of is to have good airflow in the place you play. When I've played games for a couple hours in a closed room, it felt like I was in a sauna (the noise from the fan is quite loud, but you need that power for the cooling). The battery life on this laptop is not great, but it is a heavy gaming laptop. For the specs and the price point, this is a great buy. I would totally buy this product again. I haven't tried customer support, but I'll probably update this review again if I do use it.",0
(Purchase my first laptop.): I purchased this laptop a few months ago and so far so good. I love it! I have to get used to the Microsoft part of it but all in all it's been a great laptop for a great price.,0
"(Fantastic Gaming Laptop Under $1500): At a time and place where standard video cards are running $1000+ for halfway decent ""value"" cards, this laptop delivers everything it could for less than $1500. Was a desktop replacement for my son, who has it hooked up to a 50"" 4k display at 60Hz without any issues (It 'should' be able to run 120Hz, but the TV doesn't support it) The insides to upgrade hard drive and memory are generally speaking not very easy to get into and in practice, they really don't want the consumer to do it themselves, but we upgraded ours to 32GB and added a 1TB NVMe drive to the system and it's really set to do anything he needs for quite some time.",0
"(Review from gamers: A+!): The short version is that this is by FAR the best laptop I have ever owned.But to give some context: I am a middle aged working mom who primarily wants a good laptop because I am impatient with lag and because I take a billion pictures. BUT, I do play World of Warcraft once or twice a week so whatever laptop I use needs to be gaming quality. My oldest son just (last week!) graduated from Full Sail University with his BS in Game Design so he is obviously a very heavy gamer. He's home right now for the holidays and I had him give this beauty a good test drive overnight, trying it on WoW and on some Steam games he plays. Both of us LOVE it and my son proclaims it better than his Full Sail laptop.I LOVE:+ GREAT graphics. I can have WoW set to the max graphics and it looks amazing.+ SUPER fast processing - everything, every game, every site, everything loads in a blink. WOW what a pleasure.+ I love the keys. They are slightly elevated and have, I don't know how to say it, good differentiation between them. What this means for me is far fewer typos as my fingers seem to find the right keys unerringly. Also the keyboard can be set to be backlit, which I like.+ Great storage. 1 TB which is enough for all my pictures!+ 3 USB ports, also an HDMI port+ The power cord is in the back which I think is brilliant! I hate side mounted power outlets because what if it doesn't fit your set up (what if your power cord is on the left and where you sit the wall outlet is on your right)-- then you have to drape the cord around you and it's irritating.+ Slim, light (5 pounds!), and quietGAMER SON LOVES:- Easily handles 60 FPS at maxed our graphics- Runs several programs jointly with no slow down or fan use- 1 TB of available storage perfect for storing games- Sound speakers can play extremely loud- Multiple USB ports for gaming BOTTOM LINE: Powerful, beautiful, lightning quick, and a TB of storage. LOVE LOVE LOVE!Note: The specs are well documented on the product page which is why I don't list them in detail but in short: Intel Core i7 8th gen processor, 15.6"" screen, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics, RAM 16 GB DDR4, 1000 GB Hybrid Drive",0
(Check the datre): The google support expired just 3 years after purchase!,0
"(At the beginning the computer was working fairly well, ...): At the beginning the computer was working fairly well, but later on, the blue screen of death started to appear, the video sometimes it flash, or get some sync error lines.In the last week the starting is becoming a disaster, the keyboard flash every 5 seconds on then 5 seconds off. I have disconnected all the cables and this Radom behavior continue. Today I have tried to start many times, the screen is black, sometimes give me the blue screen. From time to time it start, I have tried to backup my files, but the blue screen appear again.I have upgraded the BIOS, reseted it but the windows and the laptop is unstable.",0
"Thermals are great and the hotkey to toggle between silent, balanced, and turbo is wonderful.",0
(Great Laptop. I'd buy it again.): It's fast and very responsive. Just what I wanted to replace my old laptop. I had a few questions and the J-Tech was very responsive. I would definitely buy it again. Boots in 15 seconds and Word runs in 5 seconds.,0
"(Good computer, perfect for needs but loud and hot): This computer has had no issues running any games, been playing the new call of duty at about 80-90 fps without changing any graphics settings. Also have been using the computer for a ton of school work and haven't noticed any issues. If it wasn't for the computer getting hot really easily (It's about 80 degrees when gaming), and being super loud with its fans, then I would give this computer 5 stars. The battery life is horrendous only about 3 hours, but I am always near a plug so it doesn't bother me. The only thing that I don't know why it occurs and it could be my internet, but every now and then videos/spotify won't work and I have to restart the computer. Again not big issues and things that don't bother me, but it could bother others.",0
"(Mine is nice but it has a really bad smell?): Only problem, mine has a hard smell like mechanics, what should I do? Is this normal? I can smell it in the entire room?",0
"(Best deal for a computer): Enjoy my games, picture is nice, long lasting battery",0
"(Good Producto): Good product for browsing the internet, watching videos and little else, it is more useful for someone who wants only entertainment, watching movies, reading the news, viewing images, making video calls, but not storing content since it has very little disk space, the quality is decent",0
"(creia que era mejor): no se poque me mandan a calificar la pantalla tactil si no lo es, el discu duro es pequeno, funiona bien para los juegos pero no estoy satisfecho",0
"(A perfect mix.): Between the 10th generation Intel processor and the outstanding Nvidia RTX 2070, the MSI GL65 delivers amazing performance and visuals for the games that I want to play. Right off the bat the GL65 has shown frame rates I have dreamed of for a long time and the added RTX is just the cherry on top. Anybody who is looking for a new gaming laptop to satisfy their gaming needs I HIGHLY recommend the MSI GL65 Leopard 10SFK-062.",0
"(No keypad or touch screen but my mistake): My bad for ordering. No touch screen, no number keypad but keeping it as a back up",0
(Excelente pc para juegos y dise?o gráfico. Es súper rápida.): Muy buena inversión a un precio bajo en comparación a otros equipos con menos capacidad. En cuanto a juego corre de maravilla con los gráficos al tope. Para due?o gráfico es una bala. La recomiendo 100%.,0
"(Was okay... I could see using it ...): Was okay... I could see using it for school. Just not what I needed, so returned. Ty Amazon for the fast refund.",0
"(Used for AutoCAD Civil 3D): So far it’s worked pretty well for the last 2 days in regards to drafting in AutoCAD’s Civil3D 2020. I don’t game at all but after a couple recommendations by others who have used similar gaming laptops with a hexa core intel i7 processorS, 16GB or more of RAM & NVIDIA GTX 1660 series card I figured I would give it a try. 15.6” screen is a little smaller for drafting which a cheaper wireless mouse. Fans kick up speed occasionally when I’ve built a DEM surface with a lot of definition. But definitely a nice machine so far for AutoCAD Civil 3D usage. Should something change in my experience I’ll update later",0
(Major Trackpad Issues): I had to send the computer back after spending 2 hours on 4 seperate calls with Asus tech support. The trackpad drivers and firmware needed to be updated. Even the last tech support agent at Asus recommend that I send this back. I did order the Asus Vivobook 14 inch laptop. It is slightly bigger but not by much. The hardware is far better for the price and the screenpad on the Vivobook is awesome.,0
"(Perfect Laptop For Me!!): I am a student, and also work, so I wanted a laptop to be able to do school work at home and on my work breaks. This laptop is perfect, as it is fast, great screen quality, quiet, lightweight, and not too big or small. I also like that it's touchscreen, though it's easier to use like a regular laptop. It did come dead on arrival, but that is not a big deal unless you have to use it the moment it arrives. The battery also lasts a very long time. Overall, I'm so glad I bought this laptop, and I think it's perfect for the general user.",0
"(Problemas con el monitor): El tamaño y el rendimiento es genial, solo se le harén RAYAS en el monitor y se quitan con el tiempo, ya me ha pasado 3 veces, sin recibir respuesta de garantía",0
(New laptop): So far it seems really nice. Have not had it long enough to give a good evaluation.,0
(Slo): The thing is so slow its literally sometimes almost funny,0
"(great overall laptop): great gaming /streaming laptop. The few games I quickly tested on ultra were at least 60fps.The pros on this laptop are the 144hz thin screen, GeForce RTX 2070, per key rgb lighting , great price/what you get ratio, great color accuracy .The cons I have noticed are the fan noise when gaming , I would have liked to see a 1tb Hdd inside this instead of a 512gb and possibly a metal body for this price. Games will fill this up quickly .Im used to using a mouse close to the right of the laptop but the 2 usb outlets towards the front dont allow me to . Fingerprints easily show but are quickly cleaned off with a slightly dampy guitar cloth . 95 percent of these issues can be remedied by the user though. You could undervolt the cpu slightly to get a temperature drop and use headphones , add another hard drive and upgrade ram, use a usb hub off the left for extra usb for mouse, etcthe battery life is said to be 5.5 hours I havent tested it yet but im sure it varies depending if you are browing or gaming .",0
"(Okay device): The DVD writer never worked from day one. When I contacted HP technical support, they gave me a charge to fix it; thus, I never used it. This was disappointing because this was the deciding factor for purchasing this device.",0
(Great laptop for gaming): I am extremely pleased with this laptop. Games run smoothly and look beautiful! You won't find a better PC for the price.,0
(this was cheaper than what you can get for at Walmart): there was nothing wrong at all with this item,0

"(Excellent Laptop): I bought this for my 16 year old son, and he Loves it! He says it great for gaming and for doing his school work. He is very happy so far.",0
"(Very nice...): My experience with the Lenovo Flex 5 started about a month ago. At a glance the laptop itself looks beautiful. It has a sleek design and a crisp screen that makes videos look as if you are actually there in person.The graphics of the computer, however, leave some room to be desired. This is not a laptop you will be playing games on as it barely scrapes by to make the requirements for Civilization 5, never-mind any newer games.There are a few features that I have enjoyed in the last few weeks. First, the fingerprint sensor makes logging in fast and easy. It is very reliable and almost always recognizes my fingerprint on the first try. Second, the keyboard has a comfortable feel to it. The keys are crisp enough to have satisfaction when you type while not so loud that the whole neighborhood can hear you crunch the keys (as with some mechanical keyboards.)The battery life is satisfactory, but not the best I have seen in a laptop. Keep in mind that the screen in this computer is huge, and that alone can create a strain on the battery. Those people who like to go long periods of time without charging may find themselves out of luck and stuck in the abysmal battery saver mode.Focusing now on the flex part of the product, I don’t see myself using the tablet version too much. One way that feature is extremely useful, though, is for reading or watching a movie. Instead of having a heavy laptop sprawled across you (and the laptop is decently heavy), one can easily hold it in a more natural position to help facilitate hours of Netflix binge watching.Overall, my experience with this laptop has been a positive one. This laptop deserves a hearty 4 out of 5 stars, and to those inquiring into its purchase I do recommend it for students, businesses, and non-gamers.",0
"(Buen equipo): Llegó antes de la fecha indicada, muy buen equipo excepto que no tiene una luz que indique que tiene el Mayus activo pero en general todo bien.",0
"(Cheap Construction): This computer was milled to be basic. The mouse pad feels ""meh"". (It clicks like pressing on the top of a tin can would sound). The keys are budget & gives ill advised responses with the slightest touch.... :(I got it (as an option) for 2,3 programs that only use MSoft programs & 2 test using controllers. Oh yeah, The screen looks is a bit grainy? matted? ish?",0
(Great little notebook): Great little notebook,0
"(Great for our lil family !!): Awesome, great !",0

"(Great for the price and is upgradeable): I bought this laptop for gaming and to handle editing/drafting software. Its light-weight, has great construction, and feels good to type with. I am used to mecha-membrane keyboards and I was worried the transition to a laptop keyboard would feel funny. But this feels natural enough for me not to think about it or worry about it. I love the fact that I can buy this laptop in this day and age with the option to upgrade it if i wanted to. Love this laptop.",0
(Great value): This laptop really is fast. The graphics are intense. Excellent value for the money.,0
"(Nice laptop alternative): If you don’t need a full blown laptop this is a good choice. The speakers on at the front on bottom so sound quality isn’t the best. Battery life is great for reviewing adobe forms and web surfing, pretty good for YouTube videos.My only issue is the WiFi likes to randomly turn off then back on.",0
"(Perfect Balance of Power): This is a perfectly balanced laptop. By that I mean the Price, Specs, Looks and Everything else are just perfect! It has awesome specs that can play most games with ease and even plays older games that support ray tracing like Minecraft etcCPU- the Ryzen 5800h out performs intels 10850h all day, and run significantly cooler (I also own an Alienware with that cpu and an rtx3080) it gets HOT! Not this bad boy though, runs cool!GPU- RTX 3050ti the newest iteration of the rtx series, it’s only 4gb which is a bummer, but it performs well. Most shooters on medium hit over 100fps and even the 165hz refresh on competitive settings. Can play AAA titles in high all day with a solid 50-65fps.Ram is 16gb running at 3200mhz which is enough,l for gaming and editing easily. and it’s upgradable.Screen- very nice with the 165hz refresh rate. Some random boxes (like install wizards and system managers) are blurry but everything else looks great.Color- says it’s blue, but only in very bright light. Otherwise looks straight black to me. Only con is its a fingerprint magnet.Price- $1,049. Super great deal. Some laptops at this price have a 2060 which is slightly better, but they don’t have an 8 core 16 thread cpu, mostly i5 and ryzen 5s at best. Better trade off for people using it to game and do editing and content creation.Overall a solid laptop, with great specs and looks. Easily in the top 3 under 1200 all day.",0

"(great product): bought it for my high schooler son. He loves it, easy to use fast enough and very light.",0
"(Still test driving, but I am very pleased, excited given the great sale price!): I am still experimenting with this little girl, but I am very pleased. I do not game, so didn't enter a comment. Very smooth operation, speedy - I've not used this version of Windows, so taking my time to test drive newer applications. BUT, very pleased. Would recommend.",0

"(Muy buena compra): Llegó bien sellada, totalmente NUEVA. Empacada súper bien. Llegó antes de la fechaMuy satisfecha con la compra y kn el vendedor",0
(Verdict is still out): I was quite impressed with the specs and price point of this computer. I got the 1tb version hard drive. After about 10 minutes of the first starting up of computer we got a blue screen error. I proceeded to call Acer and they had me do any updates on software that were available. I think the update helped a little but we have had 2 more blue screen errors since. The computer has been in use less than 2 weeks. This should not be happening and as one reviewer stated he had to send computer back after major failure. The cause was supposedly a motherboard issue. Im just afraid that this too may be the problem with ours. Im going to monitor situation and read new reviews to see if this becomes a major issue.,0
"Use it for just browsing the web, researching, that sort of thing.",0
(Great specs): Gets hot quickly. Heavy computer.,0
(Don’t waste your money): This has been on my screen for the past 3 days. There’s no way to turn off the computer and I’m afraid of taking out the battery because the computer is still on. Idk what I got myself into. Pls don’t waste ur money on this.,0
"(Solid Laptop Hits Most of the Checkboxes): Im an avid gamer but bought this for work. Big fan of ASUS products in general and havnt been disappointed with their products with the exception of paying a premium for them. Its a decent gaming machine if you dont mind running at low settings or 720p. Much more situated for a casual game like Civilization or a City Builder rather than the latest frame bending triple A title. Definitely not my cup of tea for trying to game on it for more than an hour at a time unless I just had to out of shear lack of options.But its a power house for office work. Screen is bright and vibrant. Surprisingly even after heavy touch screen use it didnt get much smudges on it like a tablet does. Touch screen is very responsive. Movies look great with the 16:9 ratio and fill up the whole screen. I didnt miss a 4k display with this screen. It was fine.The keyboard didnt need much time getting used to coming from full sized keyboards it definately doesnt feel as squished as a 13"" laptop.Like others Ive had issues with the fingerprint reader. Its got about a 50% success rate on my use.Speakers have a wide range and can get very high or very low. Can be used easily in bed even if someone is trying to sleep next to you and still audible at the low settings. At the very high settings there's an atrocious amount of frame vibration after 75%+ from the speakers other wise the speakers are solid.Its a little big and clunky if you just want it for lounging around the house to surf the web, even in tablet mode. Its nice to have a full featured laptop light enough to carry around but its almost too much for just sitting on the couch. Much more comfortable on a desk or table especially if you plan to work on it for a long period of time.Overall a good laptop. For my needs Im happy with the purchase. Would recommend to anyone who wants light gaming experience but solid work computer. But for anyone that takes gaming seriously; look elsewhere.",0
"(Great): Not a bad laptop, wasn't for me, though. Perfect for surfing the web and very accessible to bring with if you travel a lot",0
"(One year later, haven't regretted this purchase once.): One year update.I bought this to replace my dinosaur Asus N53SV on a budget. After 5 years, it was still playing the latest demanding games without complaining, and the only problem being a dead battery, I decided to stick with Asus and see if their Zenbooks held up just as well.Long story short, yes. Expectations exceeded.The first thing I noticed out of the box was the quality. The aluminum body is sleek and beautiful and just puts the Macbook Air to shame, IMO. It's incredibly light and just the right size to fit on your lap. And even considering that, it's surprisingly durable. This thing has taken two or three major falls (including one where it was dropped 4 feet onto tile, hit in the corner hard enough to totally bend the metal) and keeps on going like nothing happened.The keyboard is a huge improvement over the one on my old Asus laptop; it takes little effort to type and has a satisfying click. The adjustable backlight is a great bonus.The touchpad, on the other hand, is another story. This is one of the few criticisms I can even make about it, but it can make the laptop a little frustrating to use at first. It took me months to understand just where to touch to use the right-click function, and spent some time annoyed when I'd try to open a link in a new window just to end up clicking on it instead. Once I adjusted to this, it was fine, but it took longer than it should have.My only other gripe is the screen. The matte finish is lovely and the wide viewing angle has come in handy far more often than I thought it would. However, the subtleties in darker tones tend to get lost...pictures of my black cat look more like a silhouette. It's not bad in most situations if I turn the brightness all the way up, but it can make editing pictures a little less accurate.Where this laptop really impressed me is performance. My old Asus was a quad-core i7 with a good dedicated graphics card, and the UX330 slaps the crap out of it (until you really push it with graphics). I can go from opening the laptop to being on the desktop and ready to go within 10 seconds. It's responsive like a sports car and doesn't hesitate to do what you ask. It multitasks like a champ. I was worried that the integrated graphics meant no more games for me, but it hardly even stutters when playing The Sims 3 on a huge open world.Honestly, my only regret is not saving a little more so I could buy an even better Zenbook. But for $750, I almost feel like I stole this laptop.",0
(runs like a champ!): Works great runs like a champ. I've had this for about 3 months now and its amazing ?The battery life is kinda short though ?If your looking for a good gaming laptop this would be the one ?,0
(i got my package and exactly on time to the min. thank you): thank you the package was on the porch next to the door. very pleasing and grateful.,0
"(Great Gaming Laptop, but some screen issues.): I've had this for almost 6 months, and it runs everything perfectly.There's only one problem and that's the screen burn-in. Now I have the Google Chrome search bar burned faintly into the top of my screen. It's only noticeable if on a gray or brown screen so it's not devastating but I know some people will hate it if it happens to them.",0

"(Wrong Laptop Twice): First time received the wrong model. It was an 11"" non-touch screen black tablet. The second time I received a XE520QAB-K04US vs. the XE520QAB-K02US on the link. Difference that I can tell is the processor is a Celeron vs. an M3.",0
Wireless performance was very lag spikey with the included wireless module.,0
(Light weight): I love this computer. It is very light and easy to travel with. It is not air cooled so not hot bottom or the noise of a fan cooling system. Was super easy to set up.,0
"(Screen doesn't work after about 5 months): This laptop met all of my expectations for the first few months, however one day the screen just became black. On start up I can't even see the logo. I only used the laptop about 15-20 hours per week, so it can't be an overuse issue.",0
"(Has 8gb of memory contrary to uneducated reviews): If you don't know anything about computers, don't write a review speaking about specs. This computer has the 8gb of memory as stated. 4gb on board, 4gb on a stick. That adds up to 8 I think. Snappy little computer. Got it for my 9 year old to do his zoom stuff for school. Thanks libs.Don't expect it to blow you out of the water, but more than capable at a price point that doesn't hurt. Highly recommend. This is my first anything but an HP laptop. So far, so good.",0

Connectivity is great. The screen is bright and crispy, good for watching movies or Skype. I don't play games. I use this laptop for productivity and it is great. I downloaded VirtualBox for VM and have no problems. I can use Chrome productivity apps or Microsoft ones and it's just as fast and capable. So far I have no problems or complaints. I would highly recommend this product, especially for this price.",0

The mouse pad is great too for when you’re not using a gaming mouse.,0
(Disappointed): The screen image appears blurred and the screen glitches continuously.,0
(good): very happy,0
"(Did NOT have all the features I wanted): so we had to return it.... it was returned without difficulties. It had no drive to install programs, no ethernet jack for wired internet/network use. Logging on required a Microsoft account. All these contributed to the necessity of returning it.",0
(Used under guise as new): My fault for not contact cs sooner. This laptop is actually still attached to another person. Be cautious.,0
(Broke after 4 months): Broke after four months,0
"(Great laptop, really happy with it.): Great laptop and great value for money. Only one thing which i think might be software problem or something the wifi some time disconnects for few seconds then connect again (sometimes not automatically and i have to connect manually) i don't know why but only this laptop do it my other devices at the same time never did something like that. The other thing which isn't a big problem is when i use mute function key then try to raise the volume from volume up function key it supposed to unmute and raise the volume it but for some reason it shows that on screen but actually remain muted till i use the unmute function key (this only happens one time after u power up the laptop if u repeat it again it will unmute using the volume up function key) and that's it. Over all great laptop and i think those two problems are only in my unit or in rare units and might be fixed if i reinstall windows or with some sort of update it isn't a hardware problem i guess.",0
"(Nightmare laptop): This has undeniably been the worst laptop ever. Everything on this laptop conflicts. Screen flickers, freezes, etc. Have to reboot most of the time to do anything. Need to take it in and get it reconfigured, possibly different Windows will help. Been a nightmare.",0
it's a little off-putting when you have your game drowned out by the sound of a noticeably loud whirring of laptop fans.,0
(Where do I find instructions????): Very fast. Keyboard is very sensitive. NO instructions in book form or any other form that I can find!,0
(Don’t. Waste. Your. Money.): Don’t waste your money. It’s slow and never turns on. I’ve had it less than 3 months.,0
"(Excelente): La laptop cumple con mis expectativas, es tal y como lo describe el vendedor, muy rápida a la hora de encender y cargar el sistema operativo, su batería dura alrededor de 5 horas, es liviana, altamente recomendable para aquellos que buscan una laptop para trabajo o juegos.",0
"(Decent gaming laptop with ok performance.): Powerful gami laptop, expect to run almost everything at medium and up settings. But expect it heating on the right side of keyboard, cooling system is decent. Temperature never goes up more than 75°C.",0
(Great laptop!): So fast!,0
"(Works for down load content but no way of making own cds DVD or own music): Not sure if this is standard now days ,but no cd drive, no DVD drive, so if your USB or other software issues come to play you will have to get an external cd dick (Update to disk reader not dic ,hoping your USB still works or seek a professional to repair which is costly",0
(Awesome Chromebook): Received it just in time for my son to begin remote learning.,0
(Weak charging port): Computer worked well until the charging port bent from normal plugging and unplugging. Of course it’s not covered by the warranty and Samsung quoted me $200.00 more than I paid for the computer to fix it. Consider a different chrome book. Very disappointed,0
Screen resolution is excellent,0
(Doesnt work.): I got this laptop on that day as described. I charged it for 30 minutes and then tried to turn it on but it wasn't booting. Lights were turning but no noise of fans or anything. Had to return. The package didn't come as new. I guess it was opened before and it was refurbished before. Anyway I got refund. Went to Microsoft and got the new for the same price. Mine right know working fine and I'm happy.,0
"(Mixed Feelings But Overall Satisfied): I definitely have mixed feelings about this computer. There are both positives and negatives that I have discovered in my 2 years of use (purchased March 2020).Positives:On the one hand, it is very powerful. I use it for 3D modeling and rendering and it works so well. Things I did on my last laptop that would crash don't crash on this laptop and successfully complete. I like the keyboard, it's kind of big so it took a bit to get used to but now I actually prefer this size. The screen resolution is great and I like how big the screen is.Negatives:On the other hand, the battery life sucks. I'm lucky if the battery lasts 2 hours off charger and when I'm running 3D modeling programs it's even less. It's also way too heavy, I'm a student and have to carry it around all the time and it hurts my back. And the camera... The camera is terrible! The resolution is ok, but it doesn't consistently work! Fall 2020, so like 6-8 months after I got it the camera just kept repeatedly shutting down randomly and eventually stopped working entirely (which was terrible because I was working from home and needed the camera). It was still under warranty so I sent it in and they replaced it. From then it was working fine until like 2 weeks ago (April 2022). In the last couple weeks it has randomly been shutting off during use and not be able to restart until I restart the computer. I'm worried it's going to break completely again.",0
"(Absolutely fantastic! The best laptop you can buy for less than $1000...): Everything is so snappy.Great screen, amazing battery life.Windows users, do not hesitate on getting this. After more than 10 years using windows and in certain years of college Mac OS, this runs like a f1 car.Trust me, if you want to buy a new laptop, this is it.",0
(Buen Envío internacional): La pedí con envío hasta Honduras (s traves de casillero postal en Miami y llegó en perfectas condiciones. Me encantó. Es súper rápida ?,0
"(Air Review): I've owned two Mac's (one Pro one Air) prior to this one and only purchased a new Mac because my last one was too old and could no longer support Google Chrome, videos, etc. In two months there have been several hairline cracks develop on my screen and the trackpad has cracked without any impact. My previous Macs have been indestructible so this change must be from the new construction. I was told there's no way to prevent the same damage to the trackpad in the future which makes me relatively concerned about ongoing cost if the same problem continues to occur. I would purchase an older, more durable model before this one, or be sure to get AppleCare+ because they aren't quite made to last as they used to be! Without these issues it would be a great computer, it's fast, light, portable, and holds long battery life, but the constant need to get costly repairs just doesn't offset it!",0
"light weight and has most of the connections u need, screen colors are good",0
(Ordinateur): Il est super . Rien d’autre a rajouter,0
"(can't believe this is Apple's product): I like the light weight, unbeatable.but this is what I found1. The keyboard is defected. the key "" and key @ are misplaced.2. the light on the charge cord doesn't turn to green (to indicate is fully charged).3. there is a freeze popups after using a while.4. the keyboard edge is considered sharp to me, after using a while, my wrists show lines of marks and feel irritated5. speaker is not built for music.",0
"(Excellent to use as a work laptop): I use it mostly for study and coding. It has been 2 months since I bought this and this has been working like a gem. The battery life as well as the screen is really good. If you are looking for a working laptop under 1000$ for work purpose, I think Dell XPS is the best option.",0
I’m just worried about how the heating might damage it in the long run.,0
(Five Stars): This is really amazing. Thank you so so much,0
"(Worst Purchase - No RAM Upgrade Available): Absolutely the worst purchase I could have made. This laptop does not allow you to upgrade your RAM memory. The RAM is soldered onto the hard drive with no way of replacing it for an upgrade. The amount of system memory on this device is so small that I am unable to adequately even use the computer with the computer telling me it is running low in space. I don’t even have Microsoft Office installed on this computer or even use it for gaming. I use it only to surf the web, and it still tells me I am low on space. It also doesn’t allow you to download Google Chrome or anything that isn’t a Microsoft product unless you switch out of “S” mode. You have to jump through hoops to even use your laptop the way you should. If I were you, I would simply upgrade to a more expensive laptop. You will be glad you did.",0
"(The lightest and best to type on.): After going through several xps 13 and x1 carbons (I sell electronics) I replaced my XPS13 9370 8250u laptop with this X1 carbon ultrabook and overall i like this one better. The xps had brighter screen and better color reproduction, much nicer design, better battery.The x1 carbon has the same weight as xps 13 which was a decisive point for me, and as a bonus a bigger and more usable 14"" screen. While the trackpad on xps 13 is slightly better (both are great) the keyboard on the x1 is absolutely amazing in comparison to xps 13 which is also good but nowhere near as great.The X1 carbon has a worse thermal solution than the xps 13 and as a result is obnoxiously louder and runs hotter. I solved this issue by repasting the heatsink with noctua nt-h1 paste (i recommend this one, it's easy to spread compared to other paste) After repasting the XPS13 i couldn't hear the fans anymore, but on the X1 carbon they where still on more often than i like.There is a software called ThrottleStop that helped me lower the temperatures down , improve the battery life and make fans silent. It can be configured to run minimized automatically on windows startup (task scheduler)Before temps where at ~38c Min - 65C maximum. Now they are at 27c Min, 44C max.For reading PDFs and using Office Word on this laptop i turned off turbo boost and undervolted a few option settings. The cpu now consumes as low as 0.1w power and 3.75w max.I wouldn't recommend any ultrabook that has a 4k display or i7 CPU. (i previously had both on xps 13 and carbon x1)While the 4k is very nice to look at, it makes the ultrabook run a lot hotter. The same goes for the CPU which is also a waste of money in comparison to an i5. If performance is important you shouldn't buy an ultrabook at all.",0
"(runs fine. Fans can be loud for others): Two months in, and not a single issue. Boots wuick, runs fine. Fans can be loud for others, but noise is directed away from the user.",0
(I have always had good success with Dell computers): I have always had good success with Dell computers. This one arrived with a malfunctioning hard drive and I had to send it back. Very disappointing!!,0
"(Corrige fallos de generaciones pasadas): Soy de Ecuador y al inicio estaba un poco dudoso de importar la laptop a mi país o no, al final lo hice con miedo por los malos comentarios que tenían estas laptos en sus versiones pasadas y por lo dificultoso que sería para mi tramitar una garantía. Pero sin duda esta portátil tiene un buen desempe?o:Para trabajos cotidianos esta sobrada.Para juegos si nos subes todo al máximo o si lo haces pero juegas a 1080p, no da problemas en lo absoluto.Contras que en lo personal veo:Cuando estas realizando algo pesado, el cpu suele subir a los 90 grados, si tienes configurado que los ventiladores no suban a su máxima capacidad.Eso por consiguiente hace que caliente mucho la parte de arriba del teclado, pero no es nada que no hagan otras portátiles.Cuando los ventiladores suben por arriba de los 4000rpm el sonido de las elices es un poco fuerte.Y por último la autonomía de la batería conectado un monitor secundario viendo videos o series en Netflix o Amazon suele estar por las 4 horasNo es perfecta pero ronda en un 85%",0
(Broke): All I have to share is that hinge broke after 6 months of use. Didn't save the box it came with and i cant find no serial number in The notebook. Without it asus says cant do anything to help me. Sad.,0
(Speakers dont work anymore): The speakers keep making a high pitched screech and doesnt work anymore. The screen keeps blacking out and it has to be restarted every time.,0
"(Very good computer): Good value,I use it for music productionJust get a 16Gb memory for a better experience.",0
The processor is a bit slow,0
It is a super-dust magnet.,0

(To little for too much): Had this 2 days and already know I will need another laptop soon. it is NOT as advertised and is slower than my 20 year old tower. Over all quite dissatisfying.,0
The keyboard is fantastic,0
"(Great Gaming Laptop for the Price): I ordered this product with free shipping and it actually arrived 2-3 days earlier which I really appreciate. I’m inlove with the keyboard because you can adjust the backlight and that’s what I was really looking towards. The cooling system isn’t the best, it does heat up when playing games. Just make sure you have it on a flat surface and not cloth. Also the speakers aren’t very loud but it’s very do-able for the price. I would recommend in a heart beat.",0
(califica muy bien para el trabajo en casa): muy nítida,0
"(Fast, light and a sleeper): **Year long edit**This laptop is still going strong. Just as fast as the day It arrived. Adobe CC (AfterEffects, Premiere, Lightroom, Photoshop) all work like a champ. And when i'm not working, COD Warzone gets an average of a whopping 200fps. Was not expecting that, but glad to have it.Lightwave and Maya also render much faster than the old machine I was using as well.Given the chip shortage, this is definitely a contender to a Mobile WorkFlow.Eventually, I'll get around to swapping out the 512GB boot drive to either a 1 or 2TB m.2 and upgrading the RAM, but so far, I don't see the need to.A hard deal to bet, even in 2022Had this for about 3 weeks now and it is Fast!Runs all my adobe CC programs with no issue, and gaming to boot!The 1660Ti really shines.I added another 1TB SSD for more storage, bit still have about 70% freeBattery life could be better, but what I've read, you can get a bigger one and swap it out with little issue.",0

"(Fantastic hardware for this budget): I’ve had the laptop for about two weeks now and have absolutely loved it.Pros:Screen is amazingPrice for the hardwareRTX 2070, what’s not to loveGames run super wellCons:Storage space-games aren’t small files, 500gb isn’t enoughMolded plastic is unfortunate-added a 1TB SSD for game storage, and during disassembly, I believe 1 or two of the super frail retention clips broke because it doesn’t quite fit as perfect as it did from the box which seriously irks my OCD.Dragon center is borderline uselessBattery life could be better-still working to find out which settings best fit my usesOther notes:Still trying to optimize the i7-10750H for best performance.Had a weird crash which hasn’t reoccurredParting shots:Love it so far at the price for what I received. Will update the review if there are significant changes.",0
a bit heavy for an all-around laptop.,0
(One Star): I got one and it doesnt have fingerprint sensor and you should check what screen is included. Powerful laptop!,0
"(Touchpad Inconsistencies): I like the keyboard, but found the touchpad to be hard to manipulate smoothly, even when using a mouse. I could not find any way to turn off the touchpad when the mouse was in use. This resulted in ""mixed messages."" I wish that I had chosen a touch screen. That wouldn't solve all issues, but would likely have been a better choice.",0
"(NEVER get ""Windows 10 S""): This laptop originally came w/ Win10 S which was supposed to be secure & fast but only allowed apps from the Microsoft Store. After transitioning to a FULL VERSION of Win 10 Home Edition, I have to shut off any extra features in the system tray just to operate at a ""normal"" speed w/out waiting. Excel can barely highlight cells to clear data or whatever. The solid state drive is cool and I trust the HP name... Make sure whatever you get has all the RAM you need to operate, esp. if you plan to upgrade to Win 11 coming out soon. One RAM vendor's site couldn't diagnose IF this laptop could take more or is upgradeable or not. My daughter can use this laptop for Minecraft, etc., however you my have to click click click the mouse to hit your next button.",0
"(Don't run Windows on this.): I've had this system for over 3 months now and it's great. Wait, I'm giving five stars, saying it's great, and telling you not to run Windows on it? Yes. If you have 32 GB eMMC and 2 GB RAM to work with the best way to go is running a lightweight Linux distro; neither of those metrics are enough to have a good experience with a modern version of Windows. I've run Lubuntu 16.04 through 19.04 at different points and the only problems that have come up have been ones that were OS-related, not system-related. About anything Internet works perfectly, I can use basic dev tools, retro games are fine, very quick startup, worst-case scenario I connect to my desktop with VNC...if that sounds good to you, it's worth it. If not, you might want to up your price range by about another 150 bucks.",0
The keyboard font is goofy and the track pad buttons feel old school,0
(User friendly.): N/a,0
(Terrible Laptop and Terrible Service! DO NOT BUY!!!): This laptop has gone through 3 Repairs/Replacements in less than half a year and still does not work. The Customer Service is a joke as well as they do not take my claim seriously enough to take drastic action to fix it offering at max 30 days of additional QUALITY SERVICE. The Company does not view my laptop as a FIRETEAM level issue after 3 repairs. Do yourself a service and do not buy Lenovo junk.,0
"(Five Stars): Great machine, amazon send the laptop ok",0
(Not a easy to use or set up computer): Heard Mac was different but how is unreal nothing your use to doing is easy to find on this system. Be sure you can operate it I could not sent it back for normal laptop.,0

"(Surprisingly Enjoyable): One of our windows laptops was unbearably slow (especially with windows 10 now) so we bought one of these as a spare for the kids to use. And it's surprisingly fast/responsive and ENJOYABLE to use. No it is not a premium machine but the screen, snappy response and 10 HOUR battery are great. And it's so light it makes our other laptops seem like rocks. My main machine has to be windows, but would definitely buy another of these in the future as surfing device, light work, email, kids school work, ect.",0
Being under 5 pounds makes this laptop very portable and doesn't fatigue your legs over long gaming sessions.,0
"(My smartphone and gadget-obsessed 12yo daughter loves it): It was free with my phone, so the price was phenomenal. Solid Chromebook. My daughter says it's way faster than the ones her school gives them.",0
(Defective): The wifi settings disappeared and i thought i was crazy until i had my coworker look and she notice the wifi setting wasnt there either. This laptop was defective. I returned it the very next day.,0
"(Computer problems): I ordered this 17 inch HP computer because I have had 3 of the exact same model in the past. I liked them because they are very fast ,have a backlit keyboard and a big screen with very good resolution. The computer I received was very, very slow. It took forever to try and get it set up. The keyboard was silver and the letters on the keys were white so I could not see them. The picture of the computer on Amazon had a black keyboard with white letters and backlight. The backlight on the keys kept going off. I gave up on it and removed my info from it and sent it back. Shipping too and from has been very slow. I am waiting for my refund.....",0
(Great condition): Great condition!,0
(Excellent!): An excellent computer. No complaints at all. Monitor is great!,0
"(but it is lightweight and has good image clarity): With the11.6"" diagonal screen it seem much smaller than my standard laptop, but it is lightweight and has good image clarity...Still learning Chrome software which seems simpler than Microsoft..Just wanted a unit that was basic and easy to operate...",0
trackpad is loose and rattles when touching.,0
(Did not turn on!): It doesn’t turn on. I purchased it several months ago and now when I finally really need it due to the Covid situation and schooling from home. It doesn’t turn on. Went through all the steps with Samsung to reboot it. There answer was since the war entre is expired (I purchased it in July!) I have to send it in so they can replace some parts to get it running. Ridiculous!,0
"(Great!): Love this chrome book - perfect for everyday stuff like browsing web and general home computing activities. My first chrome book and can’t believe I never had one before, like much better than my laptop, and fraction of the cost.",0
"(instructions): Would have preferred setup instructions in paper form also, so I could have been more prepared at set up.",0
(Great for sales and service): Great product and great service!!!,0
(Great value for student): This is a great option and great value for a student - bought this to replace the school-issued Chromebook for our high school son. It has a little more memory and few more features than our older basic model so this was a nice option and great value for the money. So far it's working great!,0
(I wish I had bought another make): I went out of my way to buy a Samsung Chromebook. But I am disappointed to find it rather chunky and not a sleek as I expected.. Software rather unstable. For some reason I am having big printing difficulties.,0
(Had it a year and 8 months and screen doesn’t work!): Had a year and a half and no drops or anything and the screen is flickering and is impossible to use. Dell needs to pick up their quality won’t buy another Dell,0
Large ips display pefect for movies and a fast refresh rate for shooter games.,0
(Five Stars): Worth every penny.,0
"(Light and easy to travel with!): Love everything about this, except for no backlit keyboard. I think I like it better than my Yoga 730 13.3""! Although the text on the 730 is crisper for some reason (even though they're same resolution screen). The fan on this 720 hardly ever comes on after the BIOS update and all the Windows 10 updates. Two thumbs up!!",0
(Item as described): Item as described,0
(Not a Touchscreen But it is Fast): The title says Touchscreen but it is not. I didn't buy it because it said touchscreen I just thought that would be a plus if it did so it is not a deal breaker. It is fast it uses 5g and has a 4k display.,0
(Best gaming laptop for the price): Ive had 0 issues with this computer and it runs almost any game at max settings with 0 performance drop offs,0
(On board mouse is a nockoff): Touch screen doesn't register like a faulty connection. Though you may as well buy another and just break even. Opening it voids all warranty so in SOL. Would not by again.,0
(Five Stars): We are Loving this chromebook! !,0
"(Terrible Performance): It is completely impossible to have two tabs open at once. I use this computer for school, and only use google chrome. However, it is difficult to use google chrome when I need to view a textbook and write a paper at the same time. Every time I switch between them, the page refreshes and takes several seconds for me to return to where I needed to be. I cannot listen to music while I work, I cannot watch a video, I cannot do more than one thing at once. And the performance for even the one tab I need is terrible, loading times are insufferable, and response time is very slow. If you want to do anything productive on your computer, definitely opt for something a little more pricey so that you can actually complete tasks. However, on the plus side, I love how integrated Google Drive and Chrome are with the system, as well as the battery life. I can watch hours of video on here without a problem, as long as I am not pausing it, changing tabs, or interacting with the device at all. In conclusion, buy something else, even a newer Chromebook if you don't want to spend a lot of money. Almost every computer on the market can handle more system stress than this.",0
"(Good Value): Looks really impressive, and very good value for money at this price point.",0
(The mouse didn't last month for me): I received this laptop April 22 2021… its now May 17 2021 and the mouse has quit working. I don't want to even bother with the return because it'll take over a month just to get a replacement… if u buy this u better buy a wireless or usb mouse!!,0
"(Excelente equipo pero...): La computadora es my buena y ligera.Hubiera preferido qué fuera de puro metal y no solo la parte superior.Teclas iluminadas.Carga rápida.Bateria de 12 hrs de uso seguido como estudiante. En google meet.Windows 11 qué va a todo dar.Me gustaría poder mejorar el ram sin embargo no lo necesita.256gb no es lo mejor aunque sea solid state, afortunadamente se ouede mejorar hasta 1tb ssd.Ahora solo tengo una duda directamente con el fabricante.Es normal que cuando quiero usar mi pc cargando (por que a veces si es necesario) que esta se caliente demasiado ej el area de carga y el ventilador comienza a sonar muy fuerte?.",0

"(great): great for fortnite, 144 constant fps",0
After all was said and done I got the blue screen 3 times,0
"(Heavy, thick, bad touchpad, sharp edges.): This is not a portable machine. I would categorize it as a movable workstation.It is heavy and thick. The pictures do not represent how thick this machine is because it is a wedge.For the ""aesthetics"" of a wedge they removed a lot of space for a battery and stuff.Also, the wedge has a lot of sharp edges around.If you plan to carry it around, invest into shoes with steel plate protection for toes.It may be handy in fighting off any competition at the office, as I suppose this featureswas designed for instant decapitation.For the thickness, they could have put 20 USB Type-A ports all around this laptop in 2 layers.But there is none. Turns out, the whole world still needs Type-A.The point of USB-C was to make the machines thin, so what gives?There is an intake at the bottom, which requires a straight, hard surface to drop this chunk onto.No hugging it in bed or on the beach. It is to uncomfortable anyway.The touchpad feels like cheep crap. Clicks randomly, wobbles, does not respond,comes in touch with everything due to its size, etc... worst experience ever.There is a big gap between it and the housing, which makes you wonders whatwill jump out of it.The power brick is relatively small but has a thick and cumbersome AC cable.Also the cable requires a ground support, which is ridiculous as USB-C poweradapters made to specs do not require grounding. Something odd here.As for the software.... its Windows 10 Spy-Bloat-Ware. No need to comment that.[Setup takes hours and you need to plug a cord into your brain and upload your consciousness to the mothership.]",0
"(Slim and elegant): I found the design of this laptop to be lightweight and elegant, taking up little space. Though the laptop itself is slim and compact, the touchpad is pretty big and the keyboard has large buttons, both of which is convenient for me because my eyesight isn't very good. The top of the keyboard also features the video control buttons (such as play, stop and volume controls) which make it convenient to control from the keyboard instead of the screen, as well as a keyboard illumination button, screen button, etc.The touch screen display is responsive and worked with no issues. I found the overall image quality to be superb and the sound quality to be decent. The camera quality wasn't perfect, but was okay for me. I also liked how the main screen was uncluttered and just had the internet browser and recycle bin on it, with the rest of the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Navigation was straightforward and I've had no problems with Windows 11. This laptop also features a fingerprint reader, for quicker logging in, which is nice. Overall, this laptop was high quality and I liked that even though it's small, it's powerful enough for my needs.",0
(Run great but…): Runs great but cpu gets extremely hot (90c) and hotter just running fortnite locked at 144 fps and medium settings.,0
"(Sleek..): It's a DELL! I have owned and used Dell for my personal computer and work computer since ~1993. Dell means quality. On this XPS the touch screen is smooth and very responsive. This XPS is fast. At 13"" its compact, light and thin. Get one.. ??",0
"(Not lockdown-friendly, freezes up constantly): This Chromebook freezes up constantly. We can’t have any other device on WiFi, and only one window can be open at a time, for my son to use it properly. And forget using Zoom on it - it never works. It’s fine for Google Classroom...unless you have to watch a video via Classroom, and then it freezes. Spend your money on a different Chromebook that will actually get you through the lockdown.",0

"(Be wary of Corrupt Windows): Cool laptop? No idea. Came with a corrupt version of windows and that I would have to wait almost a week for the Asus team to get back with me. Nah, I returned the product and nust went to Best Buy.This apparently was a widespread issue I was told.Windows is at fault not Asus",0
"(Meh): Overall it's pretty solid. I've had this laptop for about 2 months now and don't use it often but when I do it's almost always for gaming. I like the graphics for GTA5, Rocket League, and Fortnite as well as the videos played from my streaming services and external dvd player. What I don't like is the extremely short play time I get from the battery and the fact that this small white line suddenly appeared in the middle of the screen.I thought that perhaps I had accidentally scratched the screen at some point and didn't notice but after turning it off and looking at in the light I know that it's coming from INSIDE the screen not a blemish on the exterior. This makes for a bit of a distraction while watching videos. Wanted to give it a higher rating but I just expected more.*UpdateI changed my rating to 3 stars because, after 9 months of moderate use, I am now getting a ""no bootable device"" error when I turn it on. Tried updating the BIOS settings but it didn't work. Will have to find a repair shop near me.",0

(Laptop): I am just finding out about the touch screen but the laptop works great.,0
"(Keyboard Keys Can Stick Without Good Cooling Pad): If you game on this prepare to get a decent cooling pad to put in the middle. Once the center heats up it tends to make certain keys stick. In my case it was the spacebar. After popping it off, putting back on and switching cooling pads the keys don't stick anymore.Otherwise super satisfied with this laptop.",0
(Dell laptop): I love the screen very Sleek,0
(Cheap in price): Nice laptop like new,0
It does get pretty hot though when gaming so I am not sure of it’s longevity.,0
"(Great for personal use): I got this laptop primarily to run Path of Exile, which was tanking on my old custom built PC (no surprise there, all the parts were 7+ years old). I thought I'd be getting a moderate improvement, but I was pleasantly surprised - the graphics card doesn't have any problems running the game, even though it's one of the most complex (and complained about) that I could have picked to test it. I haven't turned down any of the game's default settings except bloom.The keyboard is big enough to play on, although I immediately disabled the touchpad - I can't type without accidentally brushing it. Would love for the touchpad to be more straightforward to disable, to be honest.One thing that I'm a little irritated by is that all of the ports (and the power connection) are basically on the right side of the machine, so I don't have as much space for my mouse hand. I can see putting a USB over on the right, but I'm pretty set on having the power cable attach at the back. For my purposes, it would be great if it had an SD card slot (so I could use it to set up 3d prints) but a lot of current machines don't so I can't really complain.It stays fairly cool, unless a cat is sitting on it. I did pick up one of the cheap little laptop stands so it doesn't sit directly on the desk and that seems to increase cooling efficiency.The laptop is also nice and small, and light. Very easy to manage.",0
It is completely modern and efficient computer.,0
(Very nice): Nice laptop. Runs well after the updates. My only complaint is the win updates took over four hours. That's with a good internet connection.,0
"(Exactly what I needed. 256gb SSD): I bought this laptop with the intention of using it for my hospital training modules and casual use at home. Although, I haven’t bought a laptop since 2009, I’ve used a variety of laptops through friends and family members. The look, the feel and the quickness when switching through applications is really is so so smooth. I’m not a techy guy, but if you want a laptop for school, work or travel, I think this is the best bet.",0
"(Acer delivered a quality laptop that does everything it advertises it can do. Acer did us right!): I bought this laptop for my daughter for college and for her leisure gaming. When it arrived (faster than expected), we were pleased that Acer added an upgraded CPU (no extra cost) since they ran low on the chip we bought. The extra speed permits gaming at its fastest! The laptop has continued to deliver quality response time, boot time, number crunching and of course gaming speed. This laptop is treasured and I will always keep Acer favorably on my mind! Thank you Acer, you came through for us!",0
"(Great speeds, so lightweight, efficient): Huge upgrade from my old Lenovo IdeaPad. Much faster for everything, and it barely weighs anything. Very convenient, looks slick, and I actually enjoy using my laptop again instead of getting frustrated with it.Some reviews online mentioned issues with the bottom of it being too thin and the mouse clicking when you're just holding the laptop - I've had it for 3 months now and that hasn't happened even once. I carry it around from living room to home office pretty often too. No issues with that.The only issue I've had is with using Citrix Workspace with dual monitors - I have a docking station and 2 work monitors hooked up to the laptop, and they work great with no issues most of the time. Using Citrix to remote in, only 1 monitor works; the other 2 are always frozen.",0
"(This is my second Lenovo Laptop.): I couldn't be happier with this laptop. Both of my Lenovo Laptops have worked without a single problem. The only thing I have done is upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and purchase an USB 3.0 DVD Drive, the Legion 5 only has USB 3.0 and no internal DVD drive.",0
"(Good quality for the price): I bought this 2 months ago and so far, it holds up pretty well. The browser is a little slow, but what do you expect from a laptop that costs less than $200? I purchased this to replace an ASUS Chromebook that I had purchased in 2016 that completely broke down for no discernible reason- I'm sure I can expect the same from this one in the next 5 years, but at least it doesn't have a touch screen that'll stop responding 5 months in. Works perfectly fine for all things web based- streaming on platform websites (not apps), Facebook, email, neopets. Not many Playstore apps are compatible with chromebooks and those that are are excessively slow. Again, the browser is a little slow, but nothing unbearable. Would definitely not recommend for any type of gaming- I can't even get roll20 to work so I can't imagine any other website with a heavier load would work.",0
"(Good For What I Need): It works for what I do, so I am very happy with it.",0
"(Barely functional, cannot run any complicated applications): This computer is bought less than a year ago, and I have these ongoing issues:-Shuts down unexpectedly and won't turn on except for keyboard lights (once wouldn't turn on for an entire week)-Struggles to open and run basic applications like Chrome and iTunes-Poor performance in complex applications like Serato and Ableton (often crashes, glitches, high latency)-Audio driver almost incompatible with audio workstations.This computer works fine to run Microsoft office and web browser apps, but struggles to perform even at a basic level with anything more complicated. This would be acceptable if it had costed less, or wasn't advertised as it is. I can't say this was anything but a waste of my money.",0
"(10/10 Amazing computer.): This computer is amazing, very reliable. Its not heavy at all, which was an important feature for me because I use it for college. I don't think I'll ever buy another brand.",0
"(Loved It!!!): Great led light keyboard, I love the matte finish and how quiet it is compared to my previous laptop. It was gift from my hubby so I love it. I dabble in WOW and RTS games and thos one does the job for the games I play, and then some.",0
It's significantly lighter than my last gaming laptop,0
"(Very smart purchase for a student.): Was a bit of a hassle setting up a color profile to change the yellowness in the screen, but it ended up looking just fine. Really good at managing a large load of tasks at once. Battery life is a bit short.",0
(x): good product,0
"(0ne major drawback. Does not have 1080 HD.): If all you need is a basic computer and are not a gamer, this one offers great value. Fast, efficient, quick battery charge.",0
(WiFi issues.): The laptop performs well. Heating can be addressed effectively through Manual Mode in the Armoury Crate. The main issue is the WiFi frequently disconnecting.,0
"(A bit of false advertising): This screen may or may not be 120hz as advertised but the computer only does 60hz out of the box. I havnt figured out a way to change that so if you care about frames buy something else. But that being said, it plays battlefield 4 easy and warzone with graphics at what would be medium. The vram is only 4gb. It does play it though. I say it’s a 5 star if advertised correctly. It does get the job done.",0
"(Buena Laptop): Tengo esta laptop desde hace mas de un a?o y la verdad es que es muy buena y comoda.La uso mas que nada para trabajar, uso programas de dise?o y te ha funcionado muy bien. Ocasionalmente juego y los graficos de verdad se ven muy bien y los juegos corren increibles.Creo que el unico contra y es que es pesada y el cargador es gigante y tambien pesado! Por lo que la hace una laptop incomoda para viajar.",0
"(This HP Laptop Did Not Disappoint): I must be one of the exceptions. This laptop, the HP 15-BS158CL series, is worth every penny. I have never had an HP before, but it seemed to me that the company was reputable. With the excellent reviews given the i5-8250U Quad-Core processor by independent testers, I gave it a try. I am not disappointed and have not had any problems at all. It is extremely fast, arrived as specified, and runs like a well made Swiss watch. I have not encountered ANY of the problems detailed by other reviewers of the same model. I could not complain if I wanted to.",0
"(Great!!!): This is a wonderful computer, especially for the price...It was easy to set up...and is great to use. It's light...the screen is brilliant...it's just what I wanted. I highly recommend it.",0
"(If you plan on expanding storage via 2.5 SSD good luck finding the correct SATA ribbon connecter.): Performs well, and not terribly loud. Marginal gains from overclocking at the expense of a dramatic increase in noise. Display is not quite as bright as I would like for a room with lots of natural light but the refresh rate is a plus. RAM and M.2 expansion is painless, however 2.5 SSD expansion is effectively impossible without finding the proper cable. After calling Acer, they pointed me to a third party that produces the proper cable. Too difficult to navigate their web page so I gave up. I have been through two cables from amazon, and they did not work.It wouldn't be so frustrating if I hadn't purchased this model for it ease of upgrade. I'm sitting at 32 gigs of ram and 1.5 TB worth of M.2. Sure wish I could have a 1TB SSD as an extra storage drive for games I'm not currently playing. COD Warzone alone ate up almost all of the original 512 with the help of windows spyware, I mean bloatware, I mean diagnostic algorithms.",0
"(Calentamiento.): La laptop es buena, pero se calienta mucho incluso cuando está en el escritorio. Si la quieres para jugar tampoco es buena opción ya que HP le pone un límite a la VRAM de 512 MB, lo que reduce el rendimiento en juegos.",0
It looks nice and handles real good,0
The boot time is fast due to the SSD hard drive,0
"(This is not a touch screen.): This is not a touch screen computer - it states that it is in the description, but it is not.",0
(Waste of money): 3 months and the laptop will not turn on. After a week it had notifications that there is not enough memory for windows updates.,0
(Don't know): Was DOA. Returned and bought something different,0
"(Great gaming laptop): I haven't had a single issue with this laptop. Love the look and feel. I have run many modern hardware intensive games at high detail without any issue. I have only occasionally had to do minor tweaks to the graphic settings. I've tried No Man's Sky, Green Hell, Subnautica, Apex Legends, and Skyrim as some examples of hardware intensive games. Again no problems with any of the games.It is quite heavy for some people but it kind of has to be for the performance. The battery life is what one would expect for a high-end gaming laptop and depends on the performance setting. At high-performance battery can be drained quite fast. Low-performance it can last quite a while, however you will need to bring to high performance to play games.The only thing I didn't like about the design is the camouflage design going diagonally across the keyboard/trackpad area. The LED rainbow lights look sweet and really gives the feel of a gaming laptop.I do not regret this purchase at all!",0
"(To work.): I didn't like the laptop stopping working , replacing it and stopping working again.One year and the laptop is no good.",0
"(Laptop works great, but screen started messing up after a few days): Bought one and 4 days after receiving it, it looked like first 2 pics upon booting. Replaced it and the last 2 pics are what the replacement looked like after a few days as well. It would not happen every time, but it would have that white line around the edge for maybe 30 min and would fade back to normal. More recently, the replacement won't turn on immediately after hitting power button. The screen stays black and no response for 15 minutes or so. I wanted to give it one more chance, because I haven't read about this happening to anyone else and I received these two laptops right before Amazon went out of stock, so I thought maybe I just got bad ones at the end but, unfortunately, Amazon can only provide a refund and are still out of stock.",0
"(Best value as a desktop replacement laptop): Impression For the first week of useage:Build quality is well above expectation: the plastic construction does not feel cheap, is solid while having a smooth touch.Gaming performance is great, could play on ultra on most games and turn ray tracing on. According to passmark, the 2070mobile inside perform better than average with machines that has the same card. The ram and NVMe that comes with it is good Samsung stuff as well.Cooling is effective. High fan speed only kicks in under high cpu load and it can cool cpu down quickly althrough cpu itself can reach 90s degree easily, but no throttling experienced so far.There is a ‘cooler booster’ fan mode which kick the fans in max speed to make it even cooler, but it could be very loud and I would concern the stress to the fans itself so won’t be using the mode frequently.The weight itself is surprisingly not very heavy, but it still need to have its large power brick around to keep its maximum performance. Carrying it around for light tasks for 2 hours is still possible unless you accidentally use its GPU on the go.Overall, you are buying a Heavy duty performer for a pretty price. I don’t find anything that should be called cutting corners, and I am happy with the value it brings. It is the best value desktop replacement laptop you can buy so far, where you can easily lope this around while is a solid pc performer.",0
(Three Stars): I have found it difficult to use,0
(Two Stars): after a few months screen just cracked and i had a protector on it,0
(Perfect for my needs): Excellent little computer just what I needed.,0
"(Great customer service): What a value, and amazing customer service . Highly recommend if u need a great computer at a very affordable price",0
"(.): Need google account to start tablet. Recommend creating a new and different account for use with new tablet. I used my existing account and wound up with all the excess ""baggage"" from my old account on the new tablet. Now I can't give tablet to daughter as present because it is now loaded with all my email accounts, passwords and etc. Also uses touch pad, not touch screen and can't be folded completely over to use as a tablet as depicted in some of the diagrams and pics. I got the least expensive version so of course it does not have some of the features of the more expensive ones.I have no real complaints with it. Too new to comment on battery life.",0
(We really like this so far): We really like this so far. I got it for my daughter for high school and college course work and she really likes it. It is user friendly and seems to be what she had expected.,0
"(So here's the thing...): July 26 2019I bought this Acer Predator Helios 300 17"" version and it kinda slow despite the specs. Probably because for some damned reason the tech decided to install Windows 10 on the 5400HDD instead of the M.2 NVMe card. WTF?By the time the Windows 10 setup finished it was too late. Didn't know until I was diagnosing the sluggish startup. Now I have to reinstall Windows 10 on the M.2 NVMe and reformat the 5400HDD. What a noob mistake from the tech department. Will update.Note: This was a returned item, maybe there's something wrong with the M.2? I will update.",0
"(A bit disappointed.): My father gave me a Samsung Chromebook for Christmas. I liked it a lot and was pretty happy with it. However, in less than 6 months, the battery won't charge. Now I need to buy replacement battery.",0
"(Great purchase!): I love it. I use for basic things like internet searching, website updates, writing documents, etc. Very efficient and fast. Would recommend. Please note: I am not a techie.",0
the trackpad really isn't all that great--it occasionally just misses input,0
"(Love): I bought this laptop for my sister and she adores it.It runs really smooth, and I also love how the keys light up when you type.",0
"(Great battery life, plenty fast, awful finger print reader): Battery life: I've owned this laptop for almost a year now and regularly get 8 hours of battery life according to the windows battery usage statistics. I usually browse the web, watch Netflix and game now and then.Preinstalled software: This machine came with a bunch of pre-installed software, which I immediately wiped after setting up windows using the windows refresh tool. I'd highly recommend this as you don't need *any* of the apps Acer has pre-installed on this laptop.Speed: No problem here. This thing is more than fast enough for its intended use: youtube, facebook, netflix, gmail, etc etc. I've never had issues with RAM, even with quite a few chrome tabs open, and I've never had to wait very long for the machine to boot or resume from sleep.Build quality: This thing is feels rock solid. I feel confident picking it up by the corner of the base, and frequently carry it around with 1 hand when I need to walk around with it.Fingerprint sensor: The fingerprint sensor is god awful. It reads my finger about 1 in every 10 tries, which is rare enough that windows always makes me enter my PIN when I try to use it to login. Sometimes, I can get my finger in just the right position and it unlocks instantly, but it's super rare. I don't understand how my phone from 5 years ago could be so much better.Everything Else: I really have no other complaints about this laptop. Everything works just fine and stays out of your way so you can just use the laptop.",0
"(Great Value): Easy to get running. Long life battery, and plenty of power.",0
The single channel RAM slows things a bit.,0
"(good computer): A bit heavier than most, but sleek design. Battery life is not quite what was promised. Comfortable keyboard. The biggest issue is having the camera on the bottom of the screen - it looks into my stomach instead of my face. Why?? It makes NO sense. I am an online instructor, and had to buy another camera for webinars.",0
(Decent laptop): Great computer for basic needs.,0
"(Love this laptop!): I was in the market for a new laptop and knew I wanted something reasonably powerful with an AMD processor. This checked all the boxes and wasn't too heavy or big. I also knew I intended to upgrade the storage and memory straight away so I wasn't too picky about the M.2 or memory configuration.That said 16GB of memory is solid for most things you can do although I have no idea about the timings it is running in dual channel so speed is optimized right out of the box. I purchased 64GB of Corsair Vengeance SODIMMs (2x32GB) with CL20 timing and they worked right out of the box with no issues whatsoever.The disk space at 1TB isn't fantastic but most people could probably get by with this and be just fine, I produce music on the road and also play games to pass the time. I ended up purchasing two 2TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus NVMe drives and upgraded the C drive to 2TB and added a 2TB D drive as well. This isn't for the feint of heart as it requires you to reinstall Windows 10 and to reinstall all of the laptop specific/platform specific drivers. While it's not too hard, it's not a beginner friendly option. I can't comment on the performance between the stock NVMe drive and the replacements but I can say it boots insanely fast and run extremely well.I also upgraded Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro with a legitimate pro key from Microsoft for $99 on their website. I know you can find cheaper keys but I really don't trust them and anyway $99 isn't soul crushingly expensive and I like the peace of mind I get knowing it's completely legitimate and I won't ever have any problems with it. This process was smooth and super easy and took all of 5 minutes to complete.The keyboard on the laptop is probably the best laptop keyboard I've ever used, the key travel isn't much but it's tactile and a little clicky. I love mechanical keyboards so it's a nice touch here and the keyboard doesn't feel the least bit mushy like some laptop keyboards can be. I also must say the LEDs are bright and look fantastic. Though I can't help but feel Asus may have gone a little overboard with the RGB you can turn off unwanted RGB elements so I can't really complain about it and it looks amazing in the dark.Laptop thickness and weight is just fine as well as the overall dimension of the laptop and it's not bad lugging through airports on using on planes. My previous laptop was a 17"" and I wasn't in love with the size or weight. 15.6"" seems spot on for a laptop you intend to take with you everywhere. It's also extremely solidly built, there's no creaking or weird sounds coming out of the mechanical bits of the chassis and the hinges on the screen are extremely supportive and when typing the screen isn't jiggling around. You put the screen up and it's rock solid and that is fantastic as far as I'm concerned. The numeric keypad on the mouse track pad seems OK but I haven't really used it for much but it does function well enough though it kind of feels ""gimmicky"" to me. My only hardware gripe is I wish it has a couple more USB ports but that's minor as you can easily add a hub. I haven't used a laptop with a ""mux"" (I think that's what it's called) switch but I like that the laptop uses the built in graphics when it doesn't need all the power of the 3080 which helps with heat and power. If it gives up a few frames in a game I'm personally OK with that sacrifice to get more time when on battery.I can't comment on any bloatware that might come installed on the laptop as I removed the original 1TB NVMe m.2 drive before I even powered on the laptop and upgraded as stated above. I do however find Asus Armory Crate and Aura Creator lacking. The laptop stats screen is great and informative, but I feel the color settings are clunky and either lacking in much customization options, or overly complex in Aura Creator. With regards to Aura Creator it's apparently extremely buggy and I can't actually apply a custom created color which is annoying I get an error doing this. I don't like Armory Crate on my desktop and apart from the laptop stats page, I don't like it on my laptop either.",0
"(OK Baseline Computer - Does not support two external monitors!): If your job requires or benefits from having two external monitors supported by a laptop, do not purchase this computer. It only supports one external monitor. Not a bad product otherwise.",0
(Fast shipping and excellent quality...): Nice item...,0
"(ACER offers good support.): It was a real challenge to change from the Edge browser to Google Chrome and I had to call ACER support to accomplish it. But that probably had more to do with my own ignorance than anything else. I've had this new laptop for only a few days & so far I like it, but I wish the keyboard would light up the way my old ACER keyboard did. Other than that, I'm satisfied with this Aspire 5.",0
(Horrible.): Not good quality. Flimsy screen dead pixels.,0
The touchscreen is bit slow sometime,0

(Do not buy wifi does not work): I’m warning you do not buy I just got it and wifi does not work I’m being 100% honest it was working perfectly fine When I first got it but a couple of hours later it wouldn’t even connect to the wifi,0
(Excelente relación calidad precio): La potencia gráfica,0

"(Best Gaming Laptop I've Owned): This laptop is probably the best bang for your buck out there. A full RTX 2070 with an i7? Yes please.I've tested several games on this machine so far and the experience has been fantastic. The fans can be a little loud when gaming, but nothing a gaming headset can't fix! Overall I am very pleased with the laptop so far and would highly suggest that anyone who is looking for a solid machine take a look at this laptop.Pros: 144hz screen looks amazingRTX 2070, enough saidKeyboard feels good and the per-key RGB is very niceCons: Speakers are a little weak",0
(The computer has amazing performance!): This computer can run pretty much any game at a good and steady frame rate. It’s performance is unbelievable! It does tend to get really hot but that’s only if it’s used for long periods of time. Overall great computer I would recommend it to anyone thinking about buying it.,0
(Great product!): Great product for the price! Compact and light... just perfect for me needs!,0
(Good buy): Good buy,0
"(Worthless): As others have reported, it either won't power up, or it will shut down randomly. Returning after two days.",0
"(Transfer speeds are so slow its barely usable): My god you can not use this computer, its slower than computers I had 15 years ago.",0
"(CRASHES ALL THE TIME): I REALLY REALLY wanted to like it. I was REALLY hoping for a good experience with transitioning from Macbook PRO to chromebook since most of my workflow would be on the internet but 400 bucks down a hole and full of regrets that I hoped the chromebook could ""handle"" more than web browsing.LIKES: light weight, decent battery life and snappy with chrome browser. Also reboots fast with the reliable and regular multiple-times-a-day crashes.DISLIKES: anything more than web-browsing is sluggish (not surprised, sure but I had high hopes) but really the only reliable aspect of it is how it unfailingly crashes multiple times a day, reliably crashes and reboots. At least reboots fast.- Has done the chromebook wash multiple times- Got rid of all the extensions one at a time- Has deleted then re-installed Apps (only a few)Gotten to the point where multiple crashes a day is now just part of the workflow until the new laptop comes after a period of denial and disappointment.",0
"(Great for casual gaming and all other basic computing.): At the price of $580 or so (price has gone up but will likely fluctuate so watch carefully), this is a bargain. It manages to be a basic but not bare-bones laptop that can handle casual games needing at least an i5 processor and the screen is a good quality, pleasing experience with depth and no annoying glare or satin softness. Images are crisp and clean and clear; even low-resolution images are displayed at their best.The keyboard and pad work as expected and there is good button feel, plenty of ports in the right places (3 total USB, HDMI, power cord, etc.), and everything works as expected except faster, if you're used to an i3 or earlier. The only real challenge I've given it is LOTRO and Witcher 3 and both operate flawlessly with the stock set up, no modifications. So if plug-and-play is how you roll, this is an excellent high-powered option for the casual gamer in need of all the usual business software in a low-priced package.Sound is OK. Fans are a bit loud but they appear to be very effective and the unit doesn't get hot. Power On to fully functional takes seconds. Not more bloatware than average but you will spend a few minutes setting it up and getting rid of unnecessary apps.Acer makes solid products aimed at the lower end of the market and this one is quite good for what it is. They also have good customer service and as other reviewers have noted, their products can be easily upgraded. I won't need to do that with the Nitro b/c it suits my needs but there are plenty of options.Excellent gaming computer!",0

One day, I sat down to use it and the internet was not available. When you click on the ball to see you internet options - that screen is gone. I took it to a trusted computer repair store, and he said the laptop is not acknowledging that there is a wireless card in it at all. This was actually a replacement laptop for the exact same one that I bought at Christmas that did the same thing. Now I am past the return window. Oh, and I've bought and installed a subscription to Microsoft 365 - money wasted probably.",0
"(Hey, it's an Apple. What more needs to be said.): Saved $100 over the price at the Apple Store. Good deal for an Apple.",0
"(Impressive!): I purchased this laptop on a Black Friday sale for $1499, I had another touch screen laptop that I needed to replace, which was a Dell Inspiron 14 inch. This has been an improvement in almost every way. With Windows 10 requiring TPM from your CPU, my older Dell laptop from 2017 couldn't upgrade to Windows 11, also on the CPU front the Dell was using an Intel core i5 5200U which is a two core 4 thread CPU ( was starting to show it's age). The LG Gram 16 is using a core i7 1260P which is a 12 core 16 thread CPU using a BIG/little architecture essentially 4 performance or ""P"" cores and 12 efficiency or ""E"" cores for power saving. These newer 12 gen and above intel CPU's are incredible for both performance AND power efficiency which means much better battery life than you'd be used to if you were using previous Intel models.This laptop will handle just about everything you can throw at it, maybe even some light gaming however it doesn't have a dedicated GPU so emphasis on LIGHT gaming. I'd imagine this would do very well in video/photo editing and handles everyday things like checking email, browsing the web, and streaming video without breaking a sweat. The screen looks great, especially for a touch screen, and it's running pretty much at 2k or 1440p. The build quality seems great as well, very light weight metal construction with seemingly very sturdy hinges. I have run some benchmarks with this laptop against my M1 Macbook air and this PC was on par with the M1, winning in some areas and losing in others, truly impressive if you know anything about the M1. I would venture to say this would be worth the buy even at full price!",0
"(Best, most powerful, most beautiful laptop I've ever owned): From graphic speed to processor speed to hard drive capacity, I couldn't have made a better purchase. The Rose Gold is beautiful. This converts to a tablet with the stylus included - it switches without hesitation. It is a bit heavy, but only by ounces.",0
(Very pleased 🙂): It's fast and meets my needs. The sound quality is good. The size seems to be just right too. I would recommend this Chrome Book.,0
"(It GLITCHES!): Bought a certified refurbished chrome book and day ONE of use, it's glitching & automatically turned off. Christmas present for my kid, and it doesn't even work properly. Bought early, so I can't even return it. Complete BS.",0
"(Missing Numeric Keys): We didn't notice that this has no Numeric keys on the right. Therefore, good for my husband...bad for me in my work. I'll have to buy my own laptop.",0
The sound quality was better than expected and the sheer portability is king for a truck driver,0
(Good product): My boyfriend uses it all the time and has had no problems,0
(Slow to start): It is nice laptop but it takes a lot longer to turn on then my 7 years old HP laptop. I am returning this one.,0
"(Pretty good laptop): Bought this for my wife to use for school. Was expecting ""okay"" performance but this thing actually has pretty exceptional performance. Laptop is very responsive and will do your basic ""school stuff"" with ease. I've not tried doing any gaming, but given the specs I would not expect much from it.The lighted keyboard is really nice although a bit low quality. My work laptop has a backlight keyboard and its hands down better. However if you did not know the difference I think you would be super happy with it.Battery life is really really good. My wife is getting a good 6-8 hours of usage off one charge with the keyboard light on which I think is really good.100% would recommend to anyone needing a PC for school or office work.",0
(Good product): Good product delivered timely,0
"(Great Laptop): This laptop is like new, easy to setup. This computer is fast and performs better that I thought it would be. A great decision on my part.",0
"(Extremely disappointed): After using this laptop for only a day after I received it, the laptop proceeded to over heat and now I am unable to even turn it on. Had high expectations for the laptop based on the reviews I read but I would now can not recommend it to anyone in good conscience.",0
(Noise of fans is annoying.): Noise of Fans is annoying.,0
"(Laptop works, but issues with charger and pen): Overall this laptop is fairly good. The screen and keyboard are quite decent, and most apps from the play store work fine.The two issues we have had so far: 1 - the pen is quite fragile and breaks easily. On the Samsung site they are $40. 2 - The laptop charger died after less then 6 months. In order to get a warranty from Samsung, I have to send the charger and laptop back to them. Since I have been using the laptop daily this is a big inconvenience. I'll end up just buying a new charger myself, but I'll definitely avoid Samsung in the future with these types of warranty policies.",0
"(I trusted that one star review): I love it so far! It came neatly packaged and it's so pretty in person! I admit I'm not tech savvy, but it's good enough for the price you paid it for and can run new gen games (which matters to me, since my old laptop is about 5-6 years old).",0
transfer rates were excellent as were launch/use.,0
(Es lo que esperaba): Este genial para Autocad y programas de diseño lo único que flaquea es la ram pero tiene un espacio para agregar otra ram así que le puedes pone más ramY para el gaming no creo que sea lo ideal pero si sirve suena mucho y tienes que jugar en en calidades bajas a buenos fpssi no quieres que tú compu quiera despegar cuál avión. Yo la veo como más inversión para diseño y rendersDespués de más de un año de uso se descompuso el controlador de wifi y eso es por el controlador que trae que es muy defectuoso pero si lo quieres arreglar compra un adaptador de red USB y ya,0
(Great laptop but a little disappointed.): I bought this for my grand daughter for Christmas and she loves it however the ad listed it a a touch screen and it is not.,0
(bad): bad,0
(I LIKE IT!!): I am 80 but was able to get going on it right away!Seems to be just what i need!Thank you!,0
(Excellent computer): This computer got me through an applied technology degree and a deployment. Excellent computer! The specs aren’t amazing but they’re good enough for me. I am able to play all the games I want and do all my work. It was durable enough to travel along with me on my deployment.,0
"Visually, the laptop is appealing with the classic Alienware design and illuminated heads adorning a slate gray lid (with no latch).",0
"(Great Device): This is my first attempt and entry into a ChromeOS device, after watching and reading countless reviews I settled on this one, given that my last Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2"" Tablet lasted me seven years.I love the feel of this device, a little on the heavier side than I liked but it is a laptop kind of device after all.ChromeOS is performing reasonably well, it still has many bugs and needs to be refined a bit more, and the implementation of Android applications is brilliant even though most of the applications can be very buggy (The developers really need to get onto this)I would recommend this to anyone who was looking at getting into a ChromeOS device for the first time, you will love the Pen that Samsung supply with it as well, it is a great little device and handy as well.",0
"(Inadequate): I bought this computer after returning a cheaper HP laptop. But this low end laptop is still to low for me to recommend it. It appears to start up quickly, but it takes forever to be ready to display anything complicated (like a photo accompanying an email). It basically is very dim-witted. It responds slowly. It drops entire web pages. It does not reach the level of a sturdy simple computer, which is what I need. The battery life is much better than my old Dell laptop, and it is light weight. Those are the only reasons I ever carry this laptop. For anything serious, I use my ancient Dell.",0
"I bougt this laptop thinking in my daughter school homeworks, downloading and playing music and watching internet videos.",0
(Great): I love it ! No complaints.,0
(Good Product.): Did not realize it did not have the capability to use cd.,0
(Have to play plugged to the charger): Awesome laptop,0
"(Works great, but CPU gets HOT!): Great for gaming, runs just about anything at max graphics settings without issues. The RTX 3060 never struggles with temperature. However, under heavy load, the Intel i5-12500H does. It regularly reaches 180°F and sometimes higher, even with the fans at full blast. I got a cooling pad for it which definitely helps bring that CPU temp down a little, though it still can get pretty hot, which isn't good for its lifespan.",0
"gap near web cam left size is bigger than the right side, mouse in certain parts looks lower",0

"(Buena laptop por calidad precio): Muy buena laptop, llevo 1 semana con ella y no he tenido problema con los juegos ni realizando trabajos pero he tenido 2 problemas.1: la duracion la batería dice que son de 5 horas pero NO, la he usado con tareas normales y dura entre 1 hora y 30 hasta 2 horas máximo lo cual casi que hay que tenerla conectada porque se descarga muy rápido.2: aveces cuando se escribe el teclado tiene un retraso increíble como de más de 1 segundo por letra pero no siempre le sucede esoPor lo demás es una muy buena laptop para jugar y utilizar aplicaciones pesadas.",0
"(Es más de lo que esperaba): Buscaba un equipo que tuviera excelente relación calidad-beneficio-precio, parecía imposible y que jamás lo iba a conseguir hasta que encontré esta Laptop. A pesar que trae poco almacenamiento, yo contaba con un disco de estado sólido, el cual le adicioné y sin problemas pude expandir el almacenamiento. Súper recomendado para trabajar en múltiples ventanas.",0
(Great laptop): Laptop exceeds my expectations for a laptop. It runs every program that i need it to and start up is fast.,0
"(Perfect for students! Must have if your school uses I-Ready.): Now first off, this is not a powerbook, or any high end high power notebook computer. We have pretty basic internet and computing needs. We currently own 3 ipads, 2 iphones, ad 2 ipod touches. These and their predecessors have mostly served 100% of our internet needs over the last 5 or years. However our school aged children have started having some issues with homework. Our school district uses iready (funny that it uses a moniker similar to Apple), and iready does not work on any of our i-devices. It works with google chrome. Now there may be some clunky backdoor way to get it to work through a chrome page on an i-device, but that is just going to complicate the situation.I figured if Chrome is the preferred operating system, then a Chromebook would be ideal. Doing some math homework, and some reading homework, on a notebook is not supercomputer stuff, so these budget Chrome books really looked to fit the bill. Plus we prefer using ipads for most internet stuff anyway, so I did not want to buy a high end machine. I found a great deal on a brand new Samsung Chromebook (I know Apple fan, buying Samsung. I do own Samsung stuff:Robot vac, refrigerator, camera, on and on), and this thing is perfect for its intended task. Oh, and it is fun to mess around with on other stuff as well. I got the 4 GB ram version so I could do more stuff, more quickly. I opened several windows, and messed around on the internet for a while and I could not lag it down. Now we do have Spectrum 100/100 internet, and I get about 113 mbps via my Orbi wifi network, so my internet is very fast.My kids are finally able to do all their iready homework, including extra math. The results are showing in test scores. I wish I had gotten this thing last year, they would be way ahead of the game. We kept hearing iready will be apple ready soon. 18 months later, I gave up and ordered this Chromebook, and it is worth every penny.This is the perfect setup for students. It is larger than an ipad, but small enough to be easily portable. It is fast enough to handle most any task you throw at it. I cant ask for more!I'll update if the honeymoon period wears off.",0
(Do not purchase): Laptop stopped working two months after receiving it. It has power but will not boot up. I didn't buy an extended warranty so I'm out of pocket for the full price.Update 05/28/20. Now laptop will not power. Tested supplied power cable. It's good. Got another compatible power cable. Laptop will still not power on. I would give it no stars if possible.,0
(Does the job): Great for the price point!,0
"The laptop feels very sturdy, but it is very lightweight.",0
(Very happy): This laptop replaces an older ROG that I was also very happy with. In addition to the performance and spec improvements I love the smaller form factor. Personally I don't find the fan overly noisy even at it's highest setting.,0
(Garbage. Chronic problems.): I have had to wipe this stupid thing 3 times. I’m an engineering student and it is so frustrating that a computer this expensive can’t even handle excel files. I wish I bought a surface.,0
(MAC): Perfect size to carry anywhere! I love this small laptop. The screen quality is great and touch screen is easy to use!,0
"(GPU Fan): I purchased this laptop around April 2020. Within less than a year, the GPU fan started to act up. It would stop spinning and my laptop will start to overheat like crazy. I went to several stores to see what's the issue with the GPU fan, and they told me that I would've to replace the fan. It's crazy how a fan is broken in less than a year. I would highly recommend avoiding getting predator helios 300 laptop to avoid future malfunction.",0
(nice): personal use/home/school,0
(Best purchase for the year): The beautiful choice for gaming laptop. Also expensive. Why is expensive? Because I buy it on the previous year and that time price has been 600$ ?,0
"(Powerful lap top): Great lap top, very well built, tough as nails. Solid processor, decent display, handles most games well at 1080 60fps. Battery life is only ok but it's what you would expect from the power that it packs so it's relative. Definetly worth the money.",0
(lightweight and easy to use): very nice for the price,0
(Do not buy unless you want to constantly replace power supplies): Never seen a laptop with such a flimsy connector for the power supply. The port itself has been bent inside and literally have had two connectors snap off with very little pressure applied. Worst laptop design I've ever seen.,0
"I get the blue screen, the same day they brought my laptop to my home",0
the battery life sucks,0
"(beautiful design, and great screen): Does everything I need it to do, beautiful design, and great screen. My only reservations are that it does not run skype, the camera is horrible, and the earphone jack takes a little wiggling to make it work after a while. The actual put together of the laptop could be better, but I believe its not something a case for 20 bucks couldn't prevent. I am a little bit rougher than normal people (meaning I'm very clumsy) so the fact that it has stayed together has been great.",0
"(This is an awesome thin and sleek laptop): I actually was able to get this laptop through an Amazon warehouse deal for $900 (i7 16gb RAM and GTX 1050 4gb) due to the item merely being repackaged so it was a steal. After using it exclusively for 3 months for everything, here are my thoughts.Pros:-Looks and feels amazing, very thin and portable.-Has a really nice backlit keyboard.-Boots very fast due to SSD having OS.-The extra 4gb of vram in the GPU come in handy.-Edits videos extremely well due to the i7.-Played all my games just fine on high settings.-Speakers are awesome.Cons:-The screen is lackluster but not too bad.-The laptop scratches and dings VERY easily.-The laptop will run very hot and rather loud under load, however I’ve NEVER had it shut down on me due to overheating. It’s ran under full load for hours upon hours on end. Be sure to have on hard flat surface for good airflow.-Battery life is pretty bad due to the high performance components inside and the battery not being very big.Overall in my opinion the pros outweigh the cons big time here. I was going on a trip for a few months out of the country and needed a laptop that could play games and edit videos well. Safe to say I am not disappointed in the slightest. I love this laptop and would highly recommend!",0
(Great little computers): Great for kids to do school or for adults to do basic things.,0
"(Really fast laptop at a decent price..): I have a MacBook Pro 2017 fully loaded.. 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 4 USB-C Thunderbolt ports and Touch Bar.. this MacBook Air blows it away !! And it's the base model ! 8Gb and 256 SSD.. I am going to pass down my MacBook Pro or sell it.. these new M1/M2 Macs are way faster than the intel versions.. I sat them side by side and ran the same programs.. the MBA 2022 beat the MBP 2017 every time.. That's not saying the MBP is not a great computer I used it for 5 years. I even now it is a great computer for pro tasks.. because it is very cheap.. you can buy my 2017 on Amazon for about $450.. ya that's right.. and I took the $150 discount on Amazon for the new MBA.. It was well worth it.. this sucker is fast !! You can get a 30 day return policy from some vendors,, I suggest you try it if your not a supper power user.. and you will have the latest M2 chip and OS! Apple will eventually drop the intel compatibility to move forward.. it could be next year or 3 years,. but they will move forward.. Oh my wife still uses a 2013 MBP 15 inch.. ya they last that long.. I am giving her my MBP 2017 so she can have the new OS Ventura..",0
"(Extremely Disappointed): I bought this in 2017 for my mom, I have a similar Acer of the same price, the difference is the SSD. I wanted more space, so I decided to just get a regular hard drive, monumental mistake. It runs at about 10% the speed as my other Acer, which once again is the same price, I still use and love. Also, it is 2020 now and as technology advances, things become outdated quickly. That's not to say the previous technology is bad, it's just that the new ones tend to be better and with identical pricing or cheaper. If you're looking for a laptop without breaking the bank let me save you a lot of time and recommend one. I have built quite a few PCs and am pursuing a master's in data science, so I know a bit about computers. Check out the HP 15-dy1036nr, its specifications are nothing short of phenomenal for the price of $599.99. Granted I haven't bought or used it, I'm purely speaking from a hardware standpoint, it comes with 8 GB DDR4-2666 SDRAM, Intel® Core i5-1035G1 which benchmarks twice as well as the CPU on this Acer, and 256 GB PCIe® NVMe M.2 SSD which by the way are the newer SSD's that read/write at 7 times the previous generation SSD's which were already blazing fast to begin with. The laptop has two downsides, it does not come with an optical drive, which is outdated but still could prove to be an inconvenience at one point, however, it's unlikely that'll you ever need it. The second downside is that the laptop comes with a virus by the name of McAfee, uninstall it as soon as you get it. If you need an antivirus, I recommend Malwarebytes, you can get a two-week trial on the premium version to test it, I had premium for around five years, but honestly, the free version should be more than enough.Also, if you're looking for a powerful computer and don't need the mobility of a laptop just build it yourself, you can build one for half the price you would get from a brand such as Alienware. It is also a neat and fun skill to have, watch a couple of YouTube videos, or read some articles to learn how. It really is not difficult; I can build one in about 20 minutes.I acknowledge that this review probably contains the use of poor grammar or incorrect punctuation. I have avoided English classes like the plague my whole life, with that being said it’s probably not the greatest analogy since it seems that people don't avoid the plague at all considering my experiences with Covid.-September 2020",0
"(laptop powerhouse): This is one hell of a laptop. The fact that you can put that much horsepower inside a thin chassis like this is impressive.Always impressed with quality Asus is able to deliver for the price.One small thing, my unit as a small coil whine, but it seems to have gone away. Hopefully it stays like this.",0
"the case does creek a little bit, and the battery life is nothing to praise",0
"(Great laptop for the price): Bought this laptop and a 32gb ( 16 x 2 ) memory kit. Installed Solus Linux and I could not be happier.Love the keyboard and the overall profile of this laptop. It's not heavy and is very thin for a 15.6"" laptop. It does have a budget NMVe m.2 drive, so I will upgrade that at some point for some additional, faster storage.Linux runs great on this laptop. All of the function keys work ( screen brightness, volume, etc ). An AMD Ryzen 7 quad-core with 8-threads and 32gb is quite a bit of resources for Linux. Time to install Docker and get to work !!!",0
(Perfect entry-level gaming PC): The PC is very heavy but its perfect for every day use and i also use it for trading.,0
the light bleed at the top corners of the screen is a little too much,0
"(Not good): After 40 days I didn't want to work anymore. I tried to contact someone, but I haven't heard anything from them yet.",0
(Great buy): Purchased for work. Absolutely perfect.,0
"(One of the best laptop for it's price): very good to use, comfortable, perfect price and great performance",0
(Great laptop!): Works great. No problems.,0
(Great Laptop): I bought this used through Amazon. It came in like-new condition. My daughter uses it to play Minecraft and Star Stables. We've had it for a month or so and are very pleased with it. I highly recommend it and buy it again if I had the need.,0
(Great basic computer): Great little computer. Love the keyboard. Good screen definition.,0
"(nice pc if use win 10 on it , 11 to erlie to use): instaled win 11 , i think its to erlie to use it yet -still have bugsbattery lower then , other thinks is goodnice pc",0
"(Perfect Budget Gaming Laptop): Its the perfect budget laptop for gamers, the only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have bigger ram but you get what you pay for right?, but thats just personal opinion.It plays ram intensive games on high settings, I can run doom eternal on medium settings, it won't run certain Triple A games such as Battlefront 2, or Skyrim on Ultra but for a little less graphics usage its pretty damn good 👍The Screen is also pretty nice as well, no screen burn issues, and its color definition is great for drawing too for any digital artists use.",0
"(Absolutely SHOCKED): When I read the reviews for this laptop, I was skeptical if it would work well. Let me just say, this is the BEST laptop I have ever owned. My boyfriend picked this specific laptop for me because I like to play a lot of games and I am starting school this Fall and need a laptop for that as well. My boyfriend is BIG into gaming and built his own PC in 2015, and he says that this laptop has 2x a better processor than his PC. He also states this laptop has 12gb of RAM and 512GB of SSD, which is really good, he expects I would never use this amount. This laptop also has an amazing graphics card, which is important for rendering files and playing games. We initially thought that the 2 in 1 aspect wouldn't be great, and would make playing games more difficult, but I fell in LOVE with the 2 in 1 aspect of this, and now I am looking to buy a Dell pencil so that I can have easier use with tablet mode when taking notes for my classes, etc. I would recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for something with a lot of storage that runs very smoothly. Like I said, this is the best laptop I personally have ever owned.",0
"(Keyboard takes a little getting used to.): The speed is great. It is light and does everything I need. The missing delete, home, end and other keys means that I have to work a little differently, but not much.",0
(Compact size): Love it. Easy to take along with you. Compact size.,0
(Average): Average laptop for the price,0
(Good Computer): Bought this for my husband. He really likes it. Much faster than his old computer and it doesn't freeze like the old one did. He is very pleased with it.,0
The lag time when using touch was so bad that it would leave the user searching while giving a description several second later,0
"The keys are brightly lit as shown in the pictures, the keys also are good quality and give a good tactile feedback when typing.",0
(Motherboard died after 6 months.): The 3rd party repair shop wasn't able to fix b/c asus doesn't sell parts. Having difficulty getting the email for the rma. Process to resolve motherboard failure is taking too long.Update: The asus website is unable to process the serial number on the device.,0
"The screen is beautiful at 144HZ and it seems larger than it is, thanks to the thin bezel.",0
"(Awful computer, lasted a month.): I received this computer on 12/11/18 and used it for less than 5 weeks before it stopped working (I.e. wouldn’t work without being plugged in, wouldn’t stay on at all, lost all of the work done on the computer, etc.). This was also incredibly inconvenient timing, but my broken computer wouldn’t know that since it didn’t work.",0
(Great): Made the switch from Windows to chromebook and am happy with it.,0
"(My Parents love it): Good quality, 11 inches large with 13 inches screen. Very portable and easy to use",0
(Pretty good for the price.): I bought this laptop for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She uses it everyday.,0
"(Useless, product should be taken off the market.): Turn it on and it shuts off immediately, and repeatedly. Unable to use and after some research I found this seems to be a common problem.",0
"(Lots of issues.): This laptop served its purpose for a few years; I got it as a photography student to use PhotoShop. However, ever since I got it I had issues with it. I opened it and set it up, and I noticed the fans were pretty loud and the computer got hot quickly. I ended up swapping it out for the same model but it had the same issue, albeit less severe. A year or two later, the glue holding the rubber feet onto the computer started melting from the computer's heat, causing them to start slipping off. I tried to attach them again with more glue, but it proved ineffective. I ended up just taking the feet off and putting rubber doorstops on the bottom of the laptop, which unfortunately prevents the screen from flipping around fully, something that was rather important to me. Now, after 2 or 3 years of owning this laptop, it seems as if the battery is swelling. The casing of the laptop is being pried apart and consequently the mousepad is less reponsive and harder to click.I would not buy this laptop again, especially not at the price they sell it at.",0
"(Compact & great for gaming): Bought this for my son, who plays a lot of games on Steam. It's been great. The fact that it has a graphics card really sold me on this. It's been a great laptop. Well-made and easy to set up. We're all glad with this purchase.",0
(Waste of money): The computer did not work very long.,0
this laptop exceeded my expectations and is definitely worth the price.,0
"(Lousy DVD as well as CURSOR software): The cursor software causes the standard (pointe) cursor, the one most commonly used along with the other cursors as well to be erratic about 80% to 90% of the time; it appears to be some type of beta test software. Additionally, the DVD player, after thirty days, required me to purchase additional softward licensing to continue to run even the standard version of this softward, then it required something similar after another thirty day period. It left me with the sense I was being scammed.",0
(Everything good except camera quality): Everything works amazing. Although choice of camera has very low quality.,0
"(Great and Convenient for Gaming): I ordered this laptop as a way for me to still be able to play my favorite steam games and stay connected with my friends while I travel.Firstly, they shipped this very fast it was very impressive. Not sure if these kudos goes to amazon or the company.The laptop was well packaged! There are many slips and covers from MSI that it was shining and so sleek when out of the box.The screen size is a great fit for portability but it’s not too small either. While I don’t like laptop keyboards, this keyboard is very nice so far. I do have a mouse I use externally because I do not like to use trackpads at all, so I can’t really say how well the trackpad works.I think usb slots are somewhat awkward to be honest but overall the placement isn’t bad or a dealbreaker.I’m very happy that there is a ethernet port and hdmi as well! This makes it super convenient unlike apple laptops that require accessories and converters.I haven’t had the most time to test the battery life yet so I will post an update to review other aspects of the laptop after heavy use.So far it’s a great, convenient laptop for gaming!",0
"(Great all around laptop that's perfect for games as well): This laptop isn't just a great laptop, it's a great desktop replacement. The CPU and GPU will get very hot. Turn off CPU boost, set the max CPU to 95%, put it in balanced mode, and get a laptop cooling mat with fan and it will perform just as good as all setting on. It's maybe a 5% difference but it isn't worth the extra heat and fan noise. It has an open slot for a 1TB SSD which takes about 10 minutes to install. I don't use it without being plugged in, so battery life is not much of an issue. But it's nice to know I can take it with me if I need it when on a business trip. This will play any game thrown at it if you're in the mood. Overall, I've very pleased with this purchase. Hard to beat a i7 with RTX 2070 for the price.",0
"Powerful- game performance exceeded my expectations, even with just 8 gig of RAM",0
"(Its ok): After a 10 hrs gaming session the cooling fans where working overtime. Had to buy a cooling pad, that really helped. We got this for multitasking and does great.",0
"(Great laptop for students): I'm a college student so I needed a laptop that was lightweight, portable, good battery life, and can run multiple programs at once (i.e. Excel, Word, Chrome). I've had this laptop for almost four months now and it has met all of my needs and then some! Battery lasts all day, laptop is extremely light, and I can easily run many programs at once. I got this to replace an older Mac Book Pro, and this is an upgrade in my opinion.",0
(working great): It works very well.,0
(Lenovo good job): Great product for a great prize. Totally recommend to anyone.,0
"(Four Stars): The design is perfect in my mind, the performance is good,",0
"(Battery life sucks, everything else is functioning ok): The battery dies fairly quickly which isn't the worst thing in the world. It is pretty big so a laptop bag is helpful",0
(Four Stars): Everything is so good. The minor problem is that sounds are not enough loudly.,0
(Microsoft Blocks Chrome and Firefox): The microsoft operating system blocks any outside software from running on the laptop. Literally you cannot install firefox or chrome. That is ridiculous as edge is a terrible browser.Other than that it is small and lightweight. Haven't used it much yet but I think it's going to be good for writing.But the fact that microsoft is locking the OS down and restricting downloads is just crazy to me so 1 star it is,0
"(Rápida y versátil): En general, la capacidad del procesador permite una velocidad de trabajo sin pausas, las imágenes se ven al instante, pa pantalla con buena resolución, en general cubre muy bien las necesidades de trabajo con programas de gráficos.",0
(Love it): Great laptop,0
The build quality is very solid and much improved from the 2018 model.,0
"(Pros and cons): Not app friendly, not much storage space (would highly recommend getting external storage if you decide on purchasing), no caps lock, no right click, and won't scroll on the mouse pad. If there are certain sites or programs that you use for work or school (or whatever reason you would need a fair priced chromebook) that would need to use anything other than Google Chrome, this is not the device for you.You can't use IE or FireFox or anything else other than Chrome since this product mainly uses Google EVERYTHING.HOWEVER, the speed is absolutely amazing and everything about this product, other than the above mentioned minor inconveniences, is very simple to set up and start using. Very easy to navigate between Google Docs, Chrome, and Gmail for all of your work, school, or online freelance needs.",0
(Pure fire 🔥): It’s good...,0
(Buy something else!): This thing was junk.Stopped working twice in a 6 week period.Returned and new one was shipped and that one crashed in a couple weeks too.,0
"(The computer runs great. We ran World of Tank Blitz (using a ...): Package arrived faster than the estimated arrival. The Chromebook was packaged well and we saw no defects (ours was used). The Intel sticker may have been hand placed, but who cares, right? The computer runs great. We ran World of Tank Blitz (using a game controller) and RoBlocks on the low Rez settings and experienced great appearance and ability to play.",0
(Dont Hesitate. Great Buy): Affordable and easy to use. Love it,0
(This laptop XPS is the best): Perfect!,0

"(Great for simple computing): I'm not a computer geek, so I can't give you any kind of computer lingo for this device. My MIL, almost 80 years old, likes to do some internet surfing, going through her e-mail, and playing solitaire. For her this is a great option. It doesn't have Windows so it is more secure as well. It was strange for me when I was setting it up for her. I had a hard time finding things (I'm used to a computer with Windows on it). But once I tootled around with it I was able to find my way around and knew this would work for her. My husband and I ended up buying an Acer tower and I love it. It does have Windows on it (I do a lot of word processing), and the browser is super fast compared to what we had.",0
This laptop is probably the smoothest and nicest laptop I have worked with in my life.,0
(CHROMEBOOK): THE PRODUCT WAS NICE. BUT IT DID NOT FEED MY NEEDS. IT DIDN'T HAVE WINDOWS AND MOST OF WHAT I DO REQUIRES WINDOW. I DID NOT KNOW THAT A CHROMEBOOK WAS NOT THE SAME AS A LAPTOP.,0
(Fast): Excelente laptop,0

"(Awesome MSI Gaming PC!): Amazingly fast response, smooth gameplay and a beautiful design. Love my MSI laptop!",0
"(Gets overheated and causes problems): Great little laptop but it gets overheated easily and then starts to run into bugs when it does which is annoying when you are trying to make a presentation or when working on Adobe premiere. It can make the program stop working or you can lose your content all together. If they could figure out how to keep it cool enough, I'd say it is an awesome little laptop. Battery life is short when running programs but if just surfing the web, it'll last long. Screen quality is amazing though.",0

"(Buena): Apresar de que fue enviada por Amazon EUA llegó un día antes de lo esperado y en muy buenas condiciones. La computadora es buena, pero hasta ahí. Por los 10k que pagué estoy satisfecho para un uso en casa y/o de tipo oficina. La adquirí debido a la necesidad actual para que mi hijo pueda realizar su escuela a distancia.Es rápida por su SSD, aunque es de 128 y sólo tienes disponibles alrededor de 80GB está perfecto para la escuela u oficina.Enciende en menos de 10 segundos, teclado retroiluminado, varios puertos USB de diferentes características, HDMI. Los altavoces son débiles y con muy poca definición; podría decir que suena igual que el altavoz de mi celular pero, cumple para lo que se necesita. La batería tiene una duración aceptable dentro de 4-6 horas dándole un uso ofimático.Por 10k no pienso que exista algo mejor, ya que viene con un procesador Intel Core i3 de 10ma generación y 128SSD (80 libres, ya lo aclaramos).",0
(a perfect gift for elderly parents or grandparents !!!): I bought this for my 84 year old mom who struggles to manage the computer. A laptop/desktop were too cumbersome and takes up too much space in her home. This is portable small and can easily be tucked away when she is finished. It is easy for her to use...very easy to set up and get her email which is why she wanted a computer!!! I enlarged the text and she now watches her soap operas and other shows. I also got her a wireless mouse which I highly recommend!! She now loves using the computer!,0
"(Only had a short time, but Great so far): Great so far, but I only used it a short time. We'll see how well it helps up!",0
"(Slower than my old macbook air which is 7 years old): I bought this laptop to replace my older macbook air. I'm shocked at how slow it is. I never had the spinning on my other one that I have on this one. I don't get it. I'm tempted to return it for a different macbook. I got a macbook because I hated how slow windows is. this is still faster than windows, but it acts like windows when you need to update it. This macbook is up to date so I don't know why it's acting like a windows computer. VERY DISAPPOINTED!Is there an update. I get more frustrated with this laptop than any windows I have ever had. My old macbook air, smoked this one. I never got booted off of wifi with my old one. I sure hope they have an update that fixes this issue. I told my friends to hold off on purchasing a new macbook air because no one has time for the spinning and getting booted off that happens constantly.I do not recommend unless they have an update to fix the problem.",0
"(It was defective from the beginning. Why am I paying a restocking fee?): The product didn't work right from the beginning. It would kick off in the middle of an application and it would shut down wifi. Also, it was difficult to turn and off.",0
(good quality laptop): the laptop is good quality it works well. the battery is still functional and hold power well. the problem i had with this was that the power cable/AC adapter that came with the laptop wasn't working and i had to purchase another one.,0
"(Stuck Pixels!): The performance of the computer is great and works exactly has expected! Able to play COD Warzone with reasonable normal/med settings and can get 100+ FPS. The battery life is okay though and you must pull some tricks when on battery but the Fn + q to blue led (power-saver mode) helps! The in-built speakers are exceptional.MAJOR ISSUE:Stuck pixels began to appear at the bottom right of the screen and progressed from right to left. I am disappointed for the durability of the monitor. At the moment, my laptop is under warranty but I can't send it in just yet since it is more school laptop as well. :/Is this an issue for others?Thanks",0
"(Slow, slow, slow): Slow, slow, slow - painfully. I love Chromebooks, but not this one. I don't do any high performance work on it (can't) but even loading normal web pages, and god forbid multiple tabs, is a test of patience.",0
(Works great): This works great and fits all of my needs.,0
"(Hot item, Just not in the good way.): So Im going to start this review with the ups.-Its fast and plays games like Fallout 4 on ultra settings-looks beautiful-Would be great if not for its major flaws which i will now list.-there is really one flaw but its so big it give it a 1 star and gets to be sent back. Plus 1 that is a direct result of that 1 flaw.-it runs HOT. i mean 70° to 80 ° on a simple unity game, it runs hot with Fallout games, it even runs hot with old games like Fallout 3 or Skyrim without mods. That is the kind of BS i have had to deal with. I had issue that also happened when when leaving chrome or firefox open for too long. I even bought a cooling fan with it because i wanted one to help with any heating issues.-to show the extent my fear was with this product. Durring the initial windows installation i could feel the heat coming off the keyboard. It got to the point i feared it would burst into flames.-the initial sign that helped me realize this was when the fans kicked in. Those fans ran as loud as jet engines and did a S!$% job at cooling. I ran Fallout 4 for about 10 min it took about 7 min to dissipate the heat. The inicial heat was 82°C that was the point i gave up and sent it back.-IF YOUR SYSTEM IS DOING THIS SEND IT BACK. THIS IS NOT NORMAL. I LOOKED UP THIS ISSUE ELSEWERE ITS A KNOWN ISSUE.I plan to avoid buying this again and will likely look more closely at these issues beforehand purchasing of another laptop. If this issue is as wide spread as it looks this system needs to be recalled.",0
"(Perfect for part time gaming students): I've been using this pc for quite some time now. There is nothing exeptional about this laptop. First It's just perfect for students that do part time AAA gaming yet stay discreet about it while doing some project in the library with your classmates. This thing won't scream LOOK AT ME I'M A GAMER from a mile away and yet run the witcher 3 at 30fps with the settings optimized between high and ultra. Second, the bad viewing angle is unnoticeable horizontally but a liitle annoying vertically but it's not a deal breaker. And lastly, the speakers, I honestly didn't expect them, they blasted some trap music till the students next door could hear it. The bass is just clean deep",0
"This is VERY light for the size, heck, its light for any size!",0

"(Great For Games): The laptop itself is amazing for what it was bought for to play newer titles at higher frames, it does so on ultra high settings running with vsync at the monitors good 144hz monitor, screen quality is great and the 144hz makes it that much better. If you want a good laptop for the right price with per key rgb with an rtx card and a newer processer this is for you, and RAM can be upgraded as well as storage. Very good laptop for the price.",0
"(Chromebooks are great !!): No complaints, no issues, no problems. Have recommended to many friends, coworkers and colleagues.",0
"(Bad battery): I really like this pc as it replaced an almost identical one, I bought 12 years ago except it was a 17 inchmodel and it just recently died. The only thing I regret is the battery. most places I shopped for arenewed laptop in this price range came with a battery that had at least 80% usefulness this one didnot. this one died from a full charge to just under 2 hours, which is lousy. I would like to keep this pc ifI could get a much better battery instead of returning it. Thanks, John",0

It feels super smooth while using most software for video editing and graphic design.,0
"(DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP): I purchased this laptop in April 2020 by the time it arrived and I was able to set it up as June 2020. I’ve use this laptop periodically over the past two years and for the most part it was in good working condition until it completely fried in July 2022.

"(Multiple Factory-related Hardware Failures): I've owned this laptop for 9 months and have had to send it in twice for factory-related hardware failure (once because the trackpad stopped working, and once because it stopped recognizing the charger). Asus was entirely unsympathetic to my situation. Buy any other laptop than this one. It's been a huge inconvenience. Very poor quality laptops. Very poor support. I'm never purchasing their products again.",0
"(Good laptop, but forget S mode): I bought this laptop at COSTCO on a black Friday special. It is everything I wanted except for the S mode. If you use Chrome or LibreOffice you will have to leave the S mode. It took me about 45 minutes with technical help from Costco, Hp, and Microsoft itself to get rid of S mode. Would give the unit 5 stars if it wasn't for the time I had to spend getting rid of S mode. The battery is ""built-in"", so that could be a problem in the future.",0

"(Good budget gaming laptop): Pros: -RGB lit keys -Crisp monitor -GTX 1600 series graphics cardCons: -8 gigs of ram but you can upgrade that with a bit more $$. -Rear exhaust is nice but not enough cooling under heavy load so might look into a cooling pad.Overall thoughts is that this laptop isn't your mid - high lvl gaming laptop, but it can handle most games you throw at it. At least for the ones I play like CS-GO, League, Minecraft, Terraria. I got this on sale for like $800 or so which is like the same price as their 15 inch monitor counterpart pricing. Lastly update the graphics driver before you play and set your browser to use the graphics card instead of the integrated version if you encounter any green flickering while browsing.2021 update: Laptop does what it needs to but only issue is the keys started to chip, and the paint peeled as well.",0
"(Hearty Laptop for Non-gamers Too): Sitting at a table in Busse Woods near Chicago, sipping a joe, watching people walk by, I typed a thing or two I'd forget in a week.""Do you want to play a game?"" she asked.

(Very happy with this): Very nice clean,0
(Great buy!): Great computer easy to use. glad I went with this brand!,0
"(Great for schoolwork and netflix): Does exactly what I need it to do, if a little laggy with how much I usually have open. This is great for my schoolwork with some light fun activities (Hearthstone in the Beta Android apps section runs okay at best, just glad it runs at all though).",0
The font on the keyboard is also not the most aesthetically pleasing thing in the world.,0

"(Got my momeys worth): Very portable, good battery life, and I love the touch screen!",0
(One Star): Only God to check emails and surf the Internet,0
"(Good for the pricepoint, short battery life.): I bought this as a lightweight travel option, If you are just watching movies on the plane and writing emails on the beach, this is great. However the battery life is short to say the least. I can see the life drain from the battery watching movies.For this pricepoint, it is a good machine.",0
great build quality and amazing keyboard and lighting,0
(Excellent): Excellent computer.,0
"(I've had it for a year and I mostly love it except a couple of things): I really like how this computer runs, I haven't really had any issues with games I've played and they all run pretty smoothly. The screen is also really bright and the backlit keyboard is nice as well. Bluetooth works well and have not had any problems on that front.As far as issues go, the volume at it's highest is not very loud and after about 8 months of having it I started having touchpad problems which started as my touchpad not working for a minute to it stopping to work most of the time. If it weren't for the touchpad problem, I'd give it another star. I got it when it was $700 which I regret because I waited and it was $600 before that. Personally, I don't think the laptop is great for the price I paid and wouldn't pay more for it because aside from the touchpad problem, the space available (even though you can install more but that means paying more) and the sound quality makes it feel like it's cheaper than it was to purchase.",0
"(Easy to use , slim takes very little space on my desk): I am in love with my lap top , slim and very easy to use .",0
(Love em): Chromebooks are awesome. This was the 3rd one i've purchased thus far.,0
"(What an awesome, light and powerful laptop!): I got this laptop to replace my squeaky HP which became noisy within a relatively short time after I bought it.This laptop is very light and very powerful, just as advertised.It does not have touchscreen capabilities; I guess that would have made it heavier?In any case, I really like the laptop and highly recommend it.",0
(Wonderful): Absolutely no issues. It does everything I need.,0
"(me encanto): muy buen dise?o, una bonita pantalla y gracias al ssd es muy veloz",0
(Reasonable price with fast and advanced technology.): So far so good,0
"(Bad Battery): Disclaimer: I bought this at walmart in store, not amazon. I'm not faulting the vender, just the manufacturer of the product.I know a bunch of you guys are raving about this product because you had it for years, but the newer ones do not last long at all. I had it for 3 months (the date it was made was 12/16, I bought it 02/17 and it wouldn't work on 05/17). I took excellent care of it before the battery would no longer charge. There's nowhere to buy the battery either, unless you want to go straight to the manufacturer and buy it for $50. I was thinking that I wouldn't need the warranty when I moved so I tossed it, before I had problems with it. That was a huge mistake. If you decide to buy it, keep the warranty. I'm not sure how they deal with fixing or reimbursing their products. I just don't want anybody who buys this from amazon thinking amazon is purposely sending faulty product. I've read countless reports on the newer ones having battery problems, so it's not just me.",0
"(It serves its purpose well which is for school.): For the money, you can’t beat this!",0
"(Potente y económica): Por este precio, un ryzen 5500 no tiene comparación. Tengan en mente el único detalle horrible: aparte de que la envían con Windows y el comprador absorve el costo (cosa lamentable) la lap no tiene entrada ethernet.",0
There were no setup or operating procedures in the box.,0
"(All 3 USB 3.0 ports finicky, borderline unusable unless laptop is on flat surface- Any solutions?): One month after purchase, all 3 standard USB 3.0 ports started having issues. Devices plugged into the ports will disconnect unless the cord was oriented properly and precisely (possibly a lose connection?). I've tried disabling USB selective settings, checking the drivers, and even physically trying to tighten the USB ports by pulling the USB port clamps up with a screwdriver. None of it seemed to have an effect.The problem mostly has an effect on the laptop's portability as moving it about causes the USB devices to disconnect and reconnect. On a flat surface like a desk, this problem is pretty much solved, but devices such as my Oculus Rift S VR headset seem to simply not work as Windows 10 ""doesn't recognize this USB device."" Hoping to avoid returning it, so if anyone has experienced this please let me know and how you dealt with the problem. Thank you.",0
MSI's customer support is a joke too. I submitted several tickets with little to no effect.,0
"(An 'ok' product): OK product. Didn't like the fact that 'Caps Lock' was missing, and screen changed color after only one week. I had to return it right away and vet refunded.",0
"After 45 minutes of gaming this thing gets soo hot, hot, hot. It was burning my fingers.",0
(False description.): ****NOT TOUCHSCREEN!!****So in the description they say Touchscreen and it's not. I bought it for my 12 year old's birthday and now what? Take it back? Wow.,0
(You get what you pay for): I bought this for my wife to be on the internet at home. It worked great for 6 months and now it is dropping wifi constantly.,0
(Excellent Value): Very pleased with this Chromebook. I gave this to the wife for surfing the net and other basic tasks. The OS was different from what she is used to but its efficient. Great looking and very light. Highly recommended.,0
(coolest laptop): By far the coolest laptop I ever have. The RGB visual effect is awsome and it is perfect for playing game. The design of keystone and numerical keypad is intersting as well. PS: The review is written for a warranty extension from ASUS.,0
"(Great laptop, high quality): This is a great laptop that is thin and durable. I would recommend a skin or case due to how lightweight it is!",0
"(So far so good): I have just received this laptop on time as estimated by amazon/UPS tracking. After spending hours doing research on different laptops, I was under the impression the most I could afford with a $1200-1400 budget was an RTX2060 or lower in combination with a decent CPU (Intel 9th/10th gen) or AMD Ryzen's new CPUs especially if I wanted a decent panel. Never would I have thought an RTX2070 would be available at this price along with more.Main pros:+RTX2070+10th gen Intel CPU+144 hz decently color accurate panel (ASUS TUF needs to step it up)+Decent ventilated design and buildMinor pros+Individual RGB lighted keys+Designated left and right click touchpad buttons+Bezel is decently small but still has quite a chin+Mini display port+USB-C portCons-Speaker (it's quite a tin-like sound with a severe lack of bass, worse than most speakers I would say) Stick with headphones for this one.-I mean most gaming laptops run quite hot due to the nature of the system so its not really a real con. If you feel like the temps are running too high, get a laptop cooling pad.I may update this review in the future depending on performance (maybe at the 6-month mark)?",0
you will find the most infuriating thing is the STUPIDLY PLACED UP BUTTON.,0
(Great computer for the money.): It has a fast Ryzen 5 2500U APU with plenty of graphics for gaming and videos. It comes with 8GB of DDR4 Sdram and a1TB HDD. Both are upgradable for the future.

"(It's OK for what it costs.): I bought this, and a few spares, for a 'don't care what happens to it' laptop for road trips, gifts, etc.I want it to surf, play netflix, and update my social status while travelling.It does this. Much better than the Dell Crap-top I tried first (Inspiron 14"" something).Sure you gotta navigate the Android enviro... but it seems to be much faster and stable than Win10.If you want a GOOD laptop, get a Dell XPS13 when on sale.If you need a crap-top, this is fine.",0
"(Great choice for web shopping, email, document prep): Best deal around and I don't need a laptop w/this. Especially love I have no software to update ! All done in the background.",0
The screen is bright and the touchscreen responsive.,0
(Five Stars): This is a smart buy!,0
"(A decent option for affordable gaming laptop, screen should be better for this price): The Victus line of laptops from HP is supposed to be for budget-conscience gamers who want a laptop that has decently powerful internals but forego some of the unnecessary things like RGB lighting and an elaborately designed case. I think that it mostly delivers on that idea, but this is still an $1100 machine and other brands like Lenovo are capable of delivering the same specs with a good screen and a little RGB (at least on the keyboard).The first thing I did when I got this laptop was upgrade the Ram to 32GB, mostly just to see if it would cause any problems using third party, 3200Mhz DDR4. I was really annoyed to see that there is no easy way to expand the storage. This laptop has a single M.2 slot and no place to install a 2.5-inch SATA SSD. The only thing that can be upgraded at all, is upping the Ram to 32GB (it will support 3rd party sticks at the full speed of 3200MHz).The Ryzen 7 5800H is one of the most powerful 45 watt processors from AMD, it is still quite good but it has been replaced by the 6800H. The difference isn't huge, but it's worth mentioning that you are getting a 2021 CPU in a 2022 laptop. The 3050Ti is still current generation, as it will be a while before the laptop versions of Nvidia's 4000 series GPUs are released. It has a 75 watt TGP, which is close to the top end of how the 3050Ti can be configured. I have used another laptop that has an 85 watt version of the 3050Ti and the performance of the two laptops is very similar and I wouldn't be worried much about it being slightly less than the maximum TGP.I really love the keyboard on this Victus, it's backlit but the only color is white. I think some people might prefer this look because it's more conventional, and kind of just looks like a regular laptop. The trackpad is really smoot and accurate, it's pretty large as well (for a Windows laptop). It's slightly off-centered, but it's not as bad as some laptops.The port selection is good, I wish they would have given us at least one 3.2 gen 2 USB C port, but all the ports top out at 5 Gigabits per second, not a huge deal, but it seems like another unnecessary feature to leave out. Just like the lack of power delivery charging via the USB C port, it's only data and video output only, no PD charging of the laptop itself. If it was available, it wouldn't provide enough power to allow you to play games, but it could work if you were using the laptop for anything non-gaming related.The last thing that I have to mention is the screen, it is 1080p with a 144Hz refresh rate, but the colors are kind of dull and disappointing for a laptop that costs over $1,000. It only has a 45%NTSC color space, which is pretty far from 100% sRGB. It's not awful or anything like that, but it's another compromise you have to make if you buy this HP Victus. If they could have given us a good screen for this price, then I could have forgiven the rest of the shortcomings. I just don't understand why they didn't try a little harder to make this competitive with other gaming laptops around the $1,000-$1,200 price range. It's like 85% of what you would get from the competition, assuming you bought wisely. So, in and of itself, it's a decent gaming laptop and you won't likely be able to find much better in the way of internal specs (CPU/GPU/RAM) for this same price, but you will find some with better screens and the same CPU/GPU that also have a 2nd M.2 slot for adding another SSD. It's up to each individual buyer to decide of these things are a big deal to them or not.Pros+Roughly the same price as other systems using a R7 plus a 3050TiNice, large trackpad and a good, backlit keyboard3050ti is configured at 75 watts (not the highest possible but close)HDMI port is version 2.1Nondescript chassis might be appealing to people who want/need a dedicated GPU without RGB and an over the top designCons-Screen is only 250 nits of brightness and 45% NTSC (you should get 100% sRGB and 300-350 nits of brightness for $1100 with these specs)No USB C chargingAll USB ports are limited to 5 Gigabits per secondNo way to add more storage short of replacing the drive that has Windows installed on it. What’s worse is that there was a place on the logic board for a second M.2 slot but HP chose not to install it on this version.There are other laptops for this price with the same specs, better screens, and with 2x NVMe M.2 slots for more storage (which equals more room to store games)Update: I realized that virtualization based security was enabled on this laptop, if you turn the “core isolation/memory integrity” slider to off in the Windows Security application, performance for gaming will increase by a substantial margin. My score in 3D mark went up by several hundred points.",0
"(Noise fan, low battery life, bad graphics and vague display.): I just got the UX330. The fan noise is very very big. And the fan keeps running for all time, actually I just only open chrome.When I unplug the power, the battery shows 100%, but it only supports about 6 hours working. But asus say it's 12 hrs, this is absoluately a Fake. And the amazon websiteAnd the screen is not clear, but I have update the graphics driver and update all and set all, but for lots of pages, it's very vague.This pc is Inter Graphics, but the amazon website shows nvidia GeForce mx150, another fake.At all, the display and noise fan make the computer hard to use.

"(Very Nice Machine, but Very Limited): It is a nice machine, but, not what I needed . Very important to understand that it is a Google Chrome OS platform (I did not) and you are somewhat very limited to Google App's and system. You cannot run any windows or any other type platform or programs, App's and games. They have a okay support center and will tell you they are working on making the chromebook able to run other type App's , but when?. Google has a very good secure type system and that seems to be what is at issue with adding other programs, app's, games, etc..",0
"(False Advertisement): I bought this laptop for my own personal use as a portable workstation when I need to work remotely for work. I have other laptops, but I believed that this would be a suitable replacement for two aging laptops with poor battery life.Problems I have with the laptop:The laptop you get has a 1.x ghz processor versus a 2.5 ghz processor as advertised.You DO NOT get 1-year of Office 365 at no charge with this laptop, just a one month trial.It does a terrible job of running Windows 10.After nearly a month of usage I have regulated this to a Linux workstation. I am currently running Xubuntu 18.10 on the device and it performs quite well given the actual specs of the hardware. Photos and documents load quickly and moderate web browsing is quite possible. The downside of running Linux over Windows is that you lose access to video streaming sites like WWE Network or Spectrum. It would have been nice to watch the football games over the weekend on my laptop.At this stage I am seriously considering a do-over on this purchase and getting a full refund.",0
Screen looks great and works well,0
"(Not good): This computer has had issues with connecting to 2.4 WiFi connection. Super slow connection and keeps going out when other device have no issues.The backlight is super dim, even at the brightest setting.I also struggled to get this computer connected to two monitors. May have been the adaptor, but the adaptor worked with two other computers.Overall, I got this one for the extra ram and faster processor, but it feels slower than my old one.Not sure what the overall problem is.",0
"(Great laptop with the latest tech and a beautiful OLED screen): I have always liked Asus's Zenbook line and this 14"" model is the best yet. It has the latest tech and a beautiful 90Hz OLED touch screen. The laptop is light and easy to take with you. Only change I made was upgrading the SSD with a 1TB model.",0
(Speed and peso.): I use this product for travel and teaching.,0
"(Excellent computer): Love the computer and how it performers. However, my adult grandson showed me the computer he has and I automatically ordered it not realizing it was a computer for gamers. I wish I had chosen a Surface pro for the usage I need. Don't play games with players on line. The surface pro would have been better suited to my needs.",0
I have had a few random black screens on the laptop it self.,0
"(Make sure you install all the windows and lenovo Updates): holly cow this thing is a beast. Playing doom at high settings i can get easily 140 fps. I started to notice some screen issues and found out it was lenovo, nvidia and/or windows updates. make sure to update everything!. Go to the lenovo website and install the radeon drivers too. this 1660ti is incredible. by far the most powerful laptop I've ever had (I am a macbook user so no surprise lol). it feels a bit cheap but the performance of this thing over weights everything. Geekbench gave me a score of 7500, the processor inside this puppy is by far the best cpu you can find anywhere, maybe the 4900hs, but I don't think anyone really need that much power. the 4800h is the sweet spot between wattage and battery life.",0
(Speed): I like the notebook very much. It is so much faster than my old lap top. The only negative is that the touch pad is a little to sensitive.,0
(No HDMI as advertised): I ordered this particular computer specifically because I wanted HDMI and it had HDMI on the description. I ordered 2 of them and neither computer had an HDMI port. This was misrepresented in the product description.,0
"(Less funcionality than an Android phone): Purchased a Chromebook to allow for basic word processing while out on the road. I have files saved to the Google drive cloud and, knowing I would be without wi-fi, I saved those files to the Chromebook disk and left town.The Chromebook will open the files, but will not save any edits to the files without an internet connection. To be clear, the files are physically on the Chromebook, but it will not save any changes. What kind of useless crap is that?I ended up having to use my phone's LTE connection and, at that point, there was no use for the Chromebook because the phone would access the files on the cloud and could save them as well.The screen maxes out at a 1280x720 resolution. It's fine for the word processing, but as soon as you run anything that you're used to seeing in 1920x1080 or better it looks like garbage.The keyboard is ""sticky"". I make no claims of being the world's best typist, but the Chromebook just doesn't seem to register all the keys pressed as one is typing. I get misspellings due to missing letters all the time, yet I don't with a regular keyboard. I know how to spell ""Amazon"", but when I type that into the Chromebook, I get something like ""mzon"". I know that I hit the ""A"" key twice, but it just ignored the input for some reason. Does it need the internet for the keyboard to work, too?Sadly, when this device stops operating, I won't even consider a replacement. It's overpriced and serves no purpose when I already have a phone and data plan.",0
Completely disappointed in both the product and the customer service available from Amazon and Samsung.,0
(works just like I needed it to.): exactly what I wanted.,0
The screen looks super nice with brilliant color.,0
(Five Stars): love it,0
"(Good laptop for lgihtweight gaming and coding): Before buying this laptop, I searched online for one month and finally decided to get this one. It was perfect for me. It's quiet, super responsive and light. I've seen ppl complaining about the delte and power button being next to each other. It wasnt a problem for me as I rarely mispress the power button for delete. Even if I do, you just need to press the power button again and it will turn back on quickly.",0
"(Ideal for College Students Who Game): This is a very good laptop pc used for gaming. Since it's my first I do not have much to compare it to, but mostly everything satisfies me.Good:It runs very quick with today's modern games. From GTA V to Cities Skylines, I have no complains to how it runs. The bootup is also good, only takes a couple of seconds. Screen is ok too with displaying colors, again, nothing to complain about. The best part is the service. The first laptop that arrived was defective. The screen was fuzzy upon startup so I needed to return it. After contacting Amazon they had me return it. The problem was that meant I was out of a laptop for a few days. However, they allowed me to purchase another laptop and wait for that one to arrive before I returned the other one.Bad:It's very loud, especially when you play high demanding games. This is good since the computer won't fry, but headphones are almost a must. The battery life isn't all that good even when I'm not running games, maybe a couple hours tops. It smudges easily by fingerprints all around also. It is kind of heavy and thick, which may serve as a problem for those wanting to fit in a lot of cases.Verdictit is a great choice for someone who needs a portable laptop that wants to play games for a low price. While one can build a PC for cheaper, this comes in handy for the college market.P.S. I made this review after having the laptop for a few months.",0

"(Calidad/precio razonable): Por el precio es un buen equipo pero la pantalla es terrible, no se pueden jugar juegos en donde sea de noche, no me quiero imaginar como seria jugar Blodborne con una pantalla tan mala jaja, recomiendo comprar una lap con pantalla IPS.",0
"(Blew my mind): I honestly never thought a laptop could run modern games, as all the ones in my life previous to this one were only good for simple games or semi-recent ones on the lowest possible settings. Absolutely no lag, for the first time in my life I get to play on ultra settings, and the keyboard lights are completely customizable with a simple add on. I'm so hooked, I'll be buying from this company for life.",0

The laptop is able to handle having a lot of tabs opened which again I need since I'm a college student. Very happy with my purchase and I definitely recommend this laptop.",0
(Great for iracing): Great gaming computer. Awesome for iracing,0
(One Star): After buying this POS laptop I will never buy dell again. It is no where worth the money spent.,0
(Average): 17.3 inch screen is good. RAM is Okay too. But the HDD failed within 3 months. To add to the pain there is no international warranty. Warranty was only valid for US. Need to spend extra $100 to get the new HDD. Lucky that Lenovo Singapore service center were quite helpful in reinstalling the Windows even though there wasn't any international warranty.,0
"(Wifi Drivers Barely Work): Barely two weeks after having received the laptop, the wifi drivers are barely working. The laptop consistently acts as though wifi does not exist and I am constantly forced to restart the laptop just to get it to recognize local wifi connections.Yesterday, no amount of restarts worked, and the wifi hub in the lower right completely vanished. I ended up having to completely factory reset the computer just to get the wifi drivers back working. Do NOT bother buying this piece of broken machinery. Sending mines back.",0
"(Beautiful and HOT): The laptop is powerful, colorful, and works wonderfully. I shopped around for weeks and this was the best value for the hardware in this computer. The fans get loud because it runs SUPER HOT, but I use a laptop cooler pad and CPU/GPU temps on a built-in monitor look good in games.Great value for under 2k!",0

(great): It is perfect!,0
(Charger stopped working): The charger stopped working after about 2 months. Reached out to the company twice. No response.,0
"(Way Better Than Expected.): I have only had the laptop a few days. So far I do like it. The screen looks much better than I had expected. It's bright and the 144mhz refresh rate is very nice. It's super fast. Has a couple easy ways to upgrade the RAM and add another SSD. 512Gb is quite limiting for gaming, so adding another SSD will help. It comes with 16GB of RAM, which seems to be plenty for what I am doing but I plan to upgrade that to 32GB as soon as I can. So far, the only two downsides are the battery life and the size of the power adapter. That thing is a brick. Also, I think the software from SteelSeries for the RGB is a bit clunky and NOT user friendly.I did play one game and I loved the fast refresh rate and the FPS I will getting. On par with my desktop because of the great CPU the 2070!If anything changes I will be sure to update! Thanks for reading! You can't go wrong with this laptop. It's priced affordable and really does perform.Edit: 10/04/2020 - I have had the laptop for several months now. I have added a SSD and upgrade to 32GBs of ram. This machine does perform. It's fast and plays most games very, very well. It's priced right. I am super impressed with this machine.",0

Amazon could not pickup the product from the Amazon locker where it arrived at the first place. I had to myself go to a far off drop off location to return the product. They Wasted my time. The seller on purpose sent a defective product and Amazon did not take any action to compensate for my waste of time. They actually made sue that I would suffer for their mistakes.",0
(Battery life is terrible and charging is a nightmare): I was super excited about this laptop the graphics are amazing but the charging and battery life are terrible.

"(Not worth it.): My aunt bought the same laptop and it worked perfectly for her, so she recommended it to me as well. So, I went and bought it, sadly it came in the day after my graduation. I was very much look forward to using it for class work instead of my old slow computer I’ve had for years. Once this laptop came in I was very excited to try it out that night, so I went through the set up process, with my aunt’s help of course, seeing as how she already set up hers. Once finished the set up process, I wanted to just play on my brand new laptop. So, I got onto candy crush with it, because the game was already on it, and I downloaded Spotify. It worked perfect for the 30 minutes I was on, but it was late and I was tired, so I went to sleep. The next morning I wake up early and go to get on the laptop. I go and type in my password, and it goes to log me in, then I go to use it to look up a few things, and set up a few things on it. The web browser doesn’t show up, so I click it again, wait a minute, click again, and then waited. Almost half an hour passed until it popped up, but by then I had already clicked whatever else was on the screen, just hoping it would work. After this I shut it down, and I must have tried it 30 more times until finally getting tired of it freezing and so many different times.",0
"(This is a really good laptop...): I've been using this now for a few weeks and have come to the conclusion that it's a really great device.It's lightweight and portable, yet packs enough power to make it a very useful machine. I am bummed that there is no way to upgrade the memory on this. I really wish there was a way to add extra RAM - but for the most part 8GB is sufficient if you are using this as a productivity machine.The processor is very quick and with the SSD - the computer overall is very fast and responsive.The housing is nice as it is a metal material. It's not in any way as well built and strong as other aluminum based computers I've used in the past - but this is much better than most plastic housing laptops out there. There is still a bit of flex if you push too hard on it or twist the keyboard - but it's probably a good balance between lightweight and portable vs heavy and rigid.Battery life is ok - not as good as I had been hoping, but it is pretty good.Touchpad / trackpad is nice and responsive. There are enough ports.I just upgraded to Windows 11 - and that runs well on this machine as well.Overall I really like it!",0
"(Moore's Law, and computer upgrades): Summary: My current desktop is an older Dell XPS 8920 from 2017, which has a i7-7700 processor.? It's still decently fast running Windows 10 Home.? I haven't had a dedicated gaming machine before, so I am very sure that this i9-12900 with the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti card is going to be insanely fast!? The last laptop we bought was a 13-inch MacBook back in August 2020.Observations: Asus has been in the computer industry for quite some time, and a quick Internet search shows them in the top 8; another search showed them as 6th in 2020.One feature that I'm looking forward?to is the ROG Intelligent?Cooling.? Laptops generally run HOT due to poor air flow; or you have good airflow, but lots of noise; neither being ideal.? Running your laptop on some sort of cooling tray (even a passive, e.g. no fan one) is better than sitting directly on a hard surface.Recommendations: When buying computers, it's generally not economical to buy the latest and greatest.? Moore's law says that processor speeds double every 18-months, and that has slowed down, and resulted in Moore's 2nd law, which says that semiconductor R&D costs are increasing exponentially.? For desktops, you can generally keep upgrading components, but with a laptop, you're pretty much locked into the motherboard, graphics card, and built-in components.Pros: Asus name brand; advanced cooling; killer gaming performance.Cons: Cost, at over $2000, this is a top of the line price (but everyone's budget is different).Conclusion: At $2050, rating this 5-stars.? I'll be updating this review in a month or two after I've had more time to use it.",0
"(Great Machine, fast and realiable): Great Machine, fast and realiable, the only issue i have is with the touch pad, no matter how i twerk the settings is still not as responsive as it should be.",0

(great laptop for price): Was everything I expected. Did put more RAM in it 8 to 16,0
"(Very good): This is my second Asus laptop quite pleased with it and the colour , very light and the battery life is great a great laptop if a person is just starting and its fast at logging in as well",0
"(Stunning Light Weight Super Fast Ultrabook!): This ultrabook laptop is definitely worth the money for a machine that is so powerful and lightweight. It has a super sturdy keyboard with a smooth touchpad. It opens and closes so smooth that it's indescribable and don't forget when opening it, the screen is at 100% sRGB (fancy scientific term for colors on the screen are extremely vivid and not washed out). When turning it on from sleep or hibernate mode, it comes back on in a split second. The speakers are loud enough that external speakers are not needed and decent in terms of quality - let's think for a second, Samsung is not going to put $500 top notch speakers into an affordable laptop - since there are laptops about the same price and the speakers are half as good. Plus, it has a headphone jack for a computer this slim! There's also 1 USB-A port so that not all ports are just USB-C (hint: Macbooks making you have to go buy several USB adapters).Now one of the cons of this laptop is it gets really hot at the bottom, so be careful if you like to put laptops on your lap. Another is the battery life is about only 5 hours when streaming video non-stop. Also, there are a lot of bloatware but they are non-intrusive so you don't need to actually get rid of them - do not get rid of the samsung updates and samsung settings apps though, they are the most useful. But the worst thing about this laptop is Windows 11! There's a compatibility problem with Firefox browser for whatever unknown reason and the bluetooth will disconnect at times. Had a previous a Acer laptop that was upgraded from Windows 10 to 11 and the damn thing shut off the bluetooth and all USB ports, kept thinking it was a hardware failure until downgraded it back to Windows 10 and everything was back to normal.But even with the cons, would still give this 5 stars. This rivals Macbooks that are just too damn expensive because this beauty's quality is just as good.",0

(Poor customer service): Received the product right before Christmas for my elementary kid’s e-learning. Not even 2 months later devised has a major error message “Chrome OS” missing. Tried to follow steps to reinstall it - next error message due to severe security module not working. Called customer service for support only to end up with the run-arounds. All I want is an IT who can look and repair it. I would never again buy electronics with Amazon. In the store at least I can have customer care look at it and repair it. Very upsetting.,0

"(Screen resolution is very poor & fuzzy): I was extremely disappointed and surprised to see and realize that the screen resolution is only 1366x768 and not 1920x1080 like my much older version of the same model CB5. You can see pixels and jagged edges, which makes even reading text very annoying.This laptop is totally unusable for serious work or any type of gaming. For just about the same price or $20 more you can get a crisp quality screen. I wish I'd checked every line of the specifications much more closely before purchasing this laptop.",0
(articulo llego roto): llego roto el producto en mal estado,0
"(LOVE IT!): My previous laptop just up and died with the blue screen of death. I had purchased the same brand - ASUS - for my father back at Xmas and he loves his. Super fast, great screen resolution, plays movies and music with great picture and sound, different model, his is a 15"".So I got myself one.This is fantastic! I might eventually add more memory, but what's on here is more than I need. It did come with the 'linkage' you need internally to add more memory.I don't game, so can't answer that question for anyone, and mine is NOT a touch screen (thank god!).Picture is super clear, good crisp colors. If you do graphic design and such, can't speak to that.Sounds are great, no echo or tiny qualities.Screen goes all the way to the edge!!!I don't have a problem with the keyboard color, yes it is just a few shades darker than the keys themselves, but it is back lit which helps. I type for a living so if you hunt and peck to type - this is not going to be for you.The power button over on the top right of the 10-key pad is a nice placement.The way the lid slides under the base gives it just that perfect ergonomic lift that really helps with typing.Plenty of ports for things, power plug is very low profile and unobtrusive (and long!).I surf the net, watch movies and youtube, work in a chat feature (like Teams). Pretty boring. But this suits all of my needs and then some.Setting up the internet was super easy.The only minor minor minor draw back is a lack of CD/DVD component, BUT - you can get an external CD/DVD drive for next to nothing and plug it in with a USB.If you just need a good basic work horse laptop and some extra oomph - this is a sure ticket to get.Would I recommend it for children, college students? Absolutely.Add more memory or an external drive if your college student is working in astrophysics, computer coding or a medical program and you're set!Will absolutely buy this brand again.",0
"(Great for gaming and video editing!): Wow, this laptop after three months of use, is great and capable. Every game that ive installed on this, works at 1080p ultra and more than 60/144fps . I've used to make videos as well with 4K footage from a a6300 Sony camera, with da Vinci resolve, works amazing for this hard tasks. The keyboard is amazing, and even when you will encounter a plastic laptop, doesn't matter, because the construction seems sturdy enough.

"(Junk): I've had it for a year now . . . and the problems started in the very beginning. Yes, I should have taken it back, but I thought the typing errors were my own. Then it got worse. Typing on one line while the text moved 3 lines above or jumped into an entirely different area of the page. Sometimes, I can't even find what I'm typing anywhere on the page.Now imagine this problem on a spreadsheet doing finances or business inventory. Do not buy this product under any circumstances. Turn it down even if someone offers it free!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"(Great laptop that has been reliable for the past 2 months!): I've had this laptop for about 2 months now and I'm happy with it. Thus far it has had great battery life (I can go a few hours without a charge), all ports work fine, it is incredibly lightweight (I barely notice it in my backpack) and I haven't had any issues yet. The computer is quiet and runs quickly when I have numerous programs open. The fingerprint reader is nice, but it doesn't work all the time (I'd say about 70-80%). The screen's colors aren't the brightest and occasionally images as crisp as they should be. You should also be careful resting your wrists on it while typing because there is keyboard flex.",0
(Battery will not hold a charge): I love the easy use of this product and every thing about it. BUT I have only had it 5 months and the battery will not charge.I do not use it on battery very often but even when I use it plugged into electric the battery is not charging. I am very disappointed in this product. I thought it would at least last the year.,0

"(It is ok.....): I do not regret buying it but to me having had it now for maybe 2 months and the white letters on the keyboard are beginning to already seem to fade away is not a good thing. I predict in another 6 months I would have to then add an external keyboard to this so I can use it and see the keys. HP you can do better than this, I expect this from an Acer not an HP.",0

I can work on it 8K videos in DaVinci Resolve 17 without any problem and animate in Fusion easily due to its 8 GB of VRAM. The prices of electronic products are going up, so I decided to buy it now before the prices go up any more.Another advantage of this laptop is its aluminum chassis, which unlike my previous laptops, is very strong and feels sturdy. The mechanical keyboard is very good and the battery life of about 4 hours is relatively acceptable for a laptop with that much power. My previous gaming laptop had a battery life of 1.5 hours.What I don't like is that it only has two M.2 bays and that the fans make too much noise if I use it in the most powerful mode.Otherwise, it is an excellent purchase.",0
(Excelente producto): Todo muy bien!,0
"(A nice, small laptop, but could use a lit keyboard): I wanted a small laptop, something light and easy to carry, but with a real keyboard for writing. This is pretty close to perfect: It's a bit slow, but it's fast enough; it could be thinner, but it's not too fat. It's cheap, and the battery life seems good. In fact, I'd give it five stars if it only had a lit keyboard - you really can't use it in the dark.",0
(Buen precio para lo que es): No dice que todo el sistema viene en base inglés pero es un detalle menor que podría ser de esperar,0
(Back to school?): Pretty good bang for the buck. Perfect for remote learning with the bonus of decent gaming capability. 9 year old loves it.,0
"(Beautiful machine, terrible fan noise and constantly running): I loved my laptop.. unfortunately I most likely broke it some how while cleaning the fan due to high fan noise. I read the fan sound was loud.. but decided to get it anyway since I'd be able to run it at silent, balanced, or turbo mode .. after a month or two, the fan would run high for no reason even on startup..for hours... Didn't even run anything .. only had my games installed and no heavy usage .. so eventually I tried resetting to factory setting like the Asus tech suggested - worked fine for about 2 days and continued to run high and loud.. tried it again but didn't work... tried going in to bios as well.. exhausted attempts, no success... so my review is at 3 because of the fan noiseLoved everything else about it.",0
"(Jackpot): I bought it for presentations and work, but also I use it for gaming which is awesome. Short storage capacity, thoI upgrade the RAM capacity to 16GBsThe battery won't last to long, so verify your battery saving settings.",0
"(Mouse quit less than a month in): My son uses a chrome book for school. He had his last one for 3 years with no issues but thought going into high school we would upgrade. Well we have had nothing but issues with it. It won't stay connected to the internet, it runs super slow and now the mouse won't work at all. Not happy with our purchase.",0
(Price low): Excellent,0
(A very good built all purpose laptop): It discreet . It doesnt scream gaming from miles.So you can easily use it for the office also.Very fast very powerfull.The only downside is that its heavy. I put it in my backpack with the power brick and its heavy.But this is what you get for a powerfull gaming laptop.Overall i would suggest it with no second thoughts.,0
(Love it. Thank you so much): Love it.Thank you so much.,0
"(I would have given this 5-stars except Apple ID is causing me fits.): This the second Apple laptop I have used. Back in 2002, I rescued a powerbook 145 someone was going throw out. It was a sweet machine. This Air is super sweet, easy to use, fast, light and with good battery life. I would give it 5 stars, if getting Apple ID setup has turned into a nightmare. Get it. The computer is great. Apple ID ... not so much.",0
I had received the laptop delivery 3 days earlier than the estimated delivery date.,0
(To early to tell): So far so good,0
the space bar is sunken in on the right side and works only half the time when pressed with the left thumb while touch typing,0
"(Muy buen producto): El equipo hasta el momento es muy rápido, sus caracteristicas están creo que por encima de la media en su precio, la relación de calidad precio es 100% recomendable, no descepciona para nada el equipo, para uso de trabajo en dise?o me funciona perfectamente. En cuanto al envío fue muy rápido y llego bien empaquetado.",0
"(Loud fan noises, only partial warranty): Extremely loud grindy fan noises as soon as I turned it on - seemed like the fan might've been misaligned or something. The warranty status said that it was about to expire and the box looked like it might've been opened, which makes me suspect this wasn't actually a new laptop. Returning.",0
"(Great laptop): It looks new, runs great and the touch screen feature is amazing!",0
Battery life is an issue if you plan on playing it unplugged,0
(Touchscreen doesn’t work): This computer is not compatible with windows 10. The touchscreen stopped working.,0
"(The best gaming PC): This PC it was what I was looking for, not only for gaming also works for my designing job.",0
The upgraded 1080p screen is well worth buying this version for if you watch videos.,0
(Great machine.): Great product.,0
(Basic for basic b******): Basic product,0
"(Would make a great office computer, but is a lousy gaming one): It had an issue upon initial set up where the computer acted funny and kept resetting the cursor to the center of the screen. This was resolved after talking to Tech support but this was the first computer I ever that owned that I had to consult Tech support upon start up.Next, it took 15 hours to download Conan Exiles but I wrote this off as being an internet issue. After the long download, I attempted to run it but it froze on the server selection screen. After several attempts and getting the same result, I attempted to play the game offline and it still froze at the launcher. It might be a incompatibility issue between game and computer but since this game is the reason I bought the computer, it makes it totally useless to me.",0
(Awesome): Just amazing i just switch to gaming on laptop soon to build my own PC,0
(It comes off as Cheap.): Poor build quality. It just comes off as disposable....like diapers. The keyboard back light didn't work. It is a cheap computer...it is what it is.,0
"(No Tech can set it up): They hang up on me after saying ""Oh I will call you back"". This as soon as I provide my info, then serial #. There is NO call back every time or I am handed off, handed off and last will say ""A call back"". Nope. They also say ""Oh, this is a Chromebook. As if something is wrong with that. The price paid was low. I am feeling it is not good so attempt to get me to buy another more expensive. Wasted time galor.

(Awsom): I love it it woks perfectly,0
(Magnifique): Ordinateur super bonne excellent portable,0
"(So far so good): Love what you get for the price, battery life is great as well as screen quality",0
"(Description inaccurate in a positive way): Described as having, large cosmetic imperfections, but did not have any at all. Brand new computer for less that $90.",0
"(laptop doesn't turn on!): I have received the laptop, after opening the amazon box, I've seen the laptop's box was open. Plus, laptop doesn't turn on, even after charging the battery.",0
The 144hz 1080p monitor is very nice and the small beezle at the edge makes viewing a pure pleasure,0
"(Wouldn’t even power up): Fresh out of the box, wouldn’t even turn on. I spent about thirty minutes with customer support troubleshooting, but then they suggested I send it in for free repair. I don’t want my brand new never used laptop to be repaired. It should work because it’s new!Sent it back and will find another brand to try.",0
"(I thought it was brand new.): This item was described as having cosmetic damages but after having it for 8 months, I can't tell that it was ever used by anybody else. Came exactly as advertised and has been the best laptop I've ever owned.",0
(Muy buen producto): Muy buen producto y lo utilizo para trabajar,0
"Games run smooth, it boots up fast and the colors on the screen are crisp.",0
"(It’s ok...): I just received this about a week ago. I gave it 3 stars cause it’s just ok. It feels a bit flimsy but lightweight. It doesn’t respond very quick and freezes a lil. It doesn’t have backlit keyboard as advertised. Not to bad to be disappointed. I use it only for internet, checking email and typing. It’s ok for that. If you’re looking for a high end pc don’t buy this. If your just doing everyday basic stuff ok. You get what you pay for.",0
"(Good computer for the money): Hard to say anything bad. Looks good, fast, runs the software that is needed for my wife’s work.",0
The resolution is almost overkill for a screen this size,0
(I saved $100 with Amazon!!!): This little puppy gets the job done at half the price of the bigger one. Great deal from Amazon.,0
"(Arrived damaged.): I didn't get to use it. I received it damaged. What ever it hit went through 2 boxes and an air gap of about an inch. Still put a dent in the bottom of the computer 1/8"" deep. Not happy about that. Plus nothing was done for me but putting the amount on a gift card. Because they were out of the computer I ordered. Locking me into buying from Amazon. Even though I needed the computer asap. Not to happy about the whole ordeal.",0
"(MacBook Air 2020 m1 chip): I absolutely love this laptop. it gets the job done for what I need it for for work. I ran into one issue where I shut it down to charge for some time and then when I tried to restart it it was just a black screen with the arrow on the screen and I had to do a hard restart on it. it has only done that once since I got this but so far I do love it. I have and apple iPhone, iPad, and an Apple Watch and it was very easy to get all systems on the same page.",0
"(Watch its no keyboard back lite): I read this questions and answer. someone asked if it was back lit. the answer was yes. I am not happy it is not. I would have ordered another level if I knew it. see post. What model gives me the same thing including keyboard backlight?Question:backlit keyboard ?Answer:Yes the adapter is includedBy Kindle Customer on June 20, 2022",0
(Good product): Light weight; would like longer battery life,0
"(Great Laptop To Get Used To): Spent a lot of time researching laptops and finally ended up going with this bad boy. It is the best bang for the buck, and performs very well. Everything is super snappy and have had no performance issues after a week of putting it through the paces. It had exactly what I wanted, a 15"" screen (for portability) and a numpad, which is not very common for the size. The keys are, however, a little cramped, and it takes a lot of getting used to. Being I wanted to have my cake and eat it too, I am ok with this so far.Everything looks great on this laptop and the screen is absolutely top notch. My biggest concern has been the wind tunnel fan on the left side, which when running a demanding game becomes the loudest sound in the room. I noticed this is only when plugged in and running on highest performance settings, but a concern nonetheless. It does mitigate a LOT of heat, and the laptop itself stays nice and cool, so it could be said that it is just doing its job (and pretty well)....just LOUD.Overall: A fantastic laptop with just a few quirks to get used to. If you do not need a numpad and will do a lot of typing, this may not be for you. If you want gaming performance and are ok with some fan noise, I would 100% recommend this!",0
(Crap): Crap,0
(Easy Setup--ready to go): Ideal replacement for my Windows 10 PC. No more fooling with windows problems.,0

"(Primeras Impresiones de Uso): Bueno, en General es la primera vez que uso Amazon, Me pareció que fue un envió rápido ya que decia que llegaba el 19 de enero y llego el 13 del presente mes, el equipo llego correctamente embalado y empacado.Es un Portátil nuevo tal como se describe con el vendedor. Su comportamiento de respuesta es alto va muy bien fluido, hasta ahora no he instalado ningún juego. trae un SSD marca SK Hynix (Hyundai) de 512GB no es el mas rápido del mercado incluso es mas rápido el Samsung evo.Visualmente el equipo se ve muy bien hecho se ve solido. Trae un cargador de 230W y su cable de alimentación es largo. En cuanto su pantalla es de buena iluminación y nitidez esta pantalla es de 144hz IPS da muy bueno colores en las imágenes, su sonido no es malo pero podría ser mejor pero para mi suena bien.Batería: Por ahora solo veo que da un rendimiento de 4 Horas 30 Minutos, personalmente creo que se queda un poco corto con su rendimiento de batería, pero pues nunca había tenido un PC Gaming, no se si este entre la media. Batería es de 60Wh con el tiempo pensaría en cambiarla por la de 80Wh. Teclado Retroiluminado color Blanco, se siente bien al tacto. No siento que el equipo se caliente con un uso general, falta probar jugando en todo su desempe?o, creo que tiene muy buena refrigeración.Seguiré usando y con el transcurrir de los días daré nuevas opiniones.",0
"(Great lil machine): I miss not having a touchscreen or a 10-key number pad, but I knew I was making those sacrifices, when I bought this laptop. The only real ""negatives"" are when you bring it back from standby/sleep mode, it's quite slow to reconnect to applications that were in use, and certain basic functions, like screen brightness, will suddenly fail to work, until updates are downloaded. I really love the look and portability, and the screen quality is great. I'm mainly using it for basic internet browsing and streaming, so it's perfect for that.",0
"(Crappy Wifi card): The biggest problem I found, it comes with a RealTek wifi card which sucks big time, I had to buy a wifi dongle another $30.00 to add to the total!! Beware of RealTek cards, they are CRAP!!! If you buy this machine don't forgot to buy a wifi dongle too.",0
(Better than expected): Fastest lightest and quietest laptop I have ever had. Very fast start up with face recognition. Very Happy with purchase,0
it's running Windows 10 and it's *snappy*,0
"(DO NOT PURCHASE FROM WORLD WIDE!): Battery will not charge, vendor must be reselling defective products then CHARGE an astronomical ""restocking fee."" for any returns. NOT TRUSTWORTHY.",0
(Touch screen and touchpad not responding. doesn't scroll properly): The headline says it all disappointed. Contacted technical help and couldnt get it fixed. going back,0
(So far so very good!!): The computer meets all my expectations and the quality is as described in the specifications. I recommend this machine,0
"Very light and thin for a 17"".",0
"(Good buy if you know what your getting): I bought this Chromebook basically out of curiosity. I've never had a Chromebook before but I have owned Windows, Apple, and Linux systems. I wanted to see just how useful it really is when used as a laptop replacement. I think a large percentage of the laptop community still has no freaking idea what chrome OS is. They were spoon fed Windows from birth. This review will make sense to the tech community, for the Win world - not so much.This Chromebook uses a somewhat customized version of Android operating system. My reading suggests about version 4.4. Before you let that dissuade you from getting one, it actually works quite well. The screen is not touch sensitive, but the track pad recognizes a two finger touch as a context menu - akin to a Windows right click. Access to the play store allowed me to quickly populate it with everything I needed to get through my day. I can work with zip,tar, and other compressed formats, and open almost any file I set my sights on. The one exception was a docx word file. My word processor only handled doc files. I could probably get around this by using the online version of MS Word but haven't tried that yet. Since tax season is coming up I tried three of the more popular online tax packages to see how they worked with it. I was able to work in TurboTax, Taxcut, and H&R block without any issues. The TurboTax version uses a very cool import to take a PDF copy of your W-2 and import and fill in all the fields. This worked flawlessly. I was also able to connect my wireless brother printer in a matter of minutes. This is kind of impressive for an older version of Android but by simply downloading the brother application for printers, I had set it up without hardly in any intervention from me. It just found it, like Win10 does with wireless printers. This Chromebook comes with 32GB of storage but has the ability to use an SD card for an upgrade. I was able to upgrade it with an additional 256gb for no more than $65. the response time on applications was well within the margin of what you would expect for a normal laptop. Everything opened quickly and applications did what they were supposed to do without any hesitation. I will say that on first impressions, the plastic casing of the Chromebook looks kind of cheap. but then again it is kind of cheap at less than two hundred dollars you're not going to get a stainless steel case. This would make a perfect workbook to take on a plane and get some work done or something to just sit around and browse internet all day. The battery life is supposed to be at around 11 hours and from what I've seen so far it looks like it would make that. I was able to use it off and on pretty much all day and only used about 50% battery reserve. It is also less than 3 pounds. It's so light you can forget you have it with you. It also is not bad for watching movies on. I installed the Netflix app and streamed several hours of video with no drop outs. All said, I think this makes a good inexpensive all around computing device as long as you have generic tasks; watching videos, browsing, writing your book. If you don't need to compile code for your daytime job you will do fine.",0
(Not all games can be downloaded): Nice screen but doesnt work very well,0
(Good quality for the price!): Good quality for the price,0
(No costumer service!): I ordered a helios predator 300 N came in everything looks fine but I take a glance at the number key and the whole key is poped out the keyboard...,0
(Non functional): The A key did not work. Dell support had me run diagnostic scan and power off/on. Problem persisted. Returning to Amazon. Off to Best Buy to look at HPs.,0
"(Far better than I had hoped!): I had never considered a Mac before, I was a lifelong windows user.I’m setting up for part time freelancing. I have years of experience with 3D mechanical engineering and design, as well as high-end 3D photo-realistic rendering and animation.These two disciplines combined require heavy memory usage, CPU power, and GPU speed.For a windows machine, those demands were going to cost me twice what this machine costs. So I researched the technology and talked to a MacBook Pro M1 user. He couldn’t tell me the MacBook Air M2 would meet my demands, but knew the Pro would.I took the chance, and couldn’t be more pleased! Not only have I not slowed it down yet, but this fabless machine base even gotten warm once!Super fast feather light workhorse!I’m still getting used to the OS but that’s been easier than I thought as well.I can honestly say I will never buy another “PC”",0
"(The Crucial SSD didn't work): It's annoying but the storage in the computer didn't work, this took a long time to figure out, and caused a lot of hassle. I ordered a new storage device that should work, but one has to wonder why they ship computers with defective memory?If the storage had worked fine I would have given 5 stars, the computer works great otherwise.",0
"(Nice laptop, excellent screen,): This laptop has the 110 watt 2070. Despite that high wattage video card, the fans don't run hard when they are set to the regular ""automatic"" mode. You can press a button at the top right of the keyboard that forces the fans to run at full speed but so far it has not been necessary. I don't run super intensive games with it, Just WoT, and WoWs, as well as Armored Warfare and Warthunder. I will update this review once I have played something more intensive. So far though, in the games mentioned above, I get 150+ fps with everything on highest settings at 1920x1080P and 144hz. Not bad for a laptop, especially considering the fans on auto rarely go above a low rpm.The first laptop I received had an obvious problem with the graphics chip heat sink fan. It ran hot as hell, even with the fans forced to run at full speed, and it crashed very frequently in games no matter the measures I took.The speakers aren't bad, for a laptop. You can watch a movie on the built-in speakers if you turn the volume up all the way, just don't expect anything more than ""ok"" sound quality and volume. Its acceptable for a laptop, thats about it. The keys feel as though they are slightly convex. Because of this, my fingers always feel as though they are sliding everywhere on the keys, probably because they are. The keys when pushed in have a nice positive feel to them which loans some tactility back to the keyboard. The right-side shift key is annoyingly short, but I will get used to it I hope. The backlighting works well, with the led light showing up through the keys so you can read the letters in the dark as opposed to cheap led backlit keyboards that only have the led lights under the keys, but they don't shine up through the keys. The wireless X card is stupid fast; I was getting sustained download speeds of 22Mb/sec, and it may be capable of more though I haven't checked what the theoretical speeds are. The bluetooth works well with very minimal sound lag while watching youtube videos using a bluetooth (4 or 5...not sure which) speaker. There are several driver updates from MSI as of this writing, and a BIOS update as well. The UEFI BIOS is a bit sparse in options compared to a nice desktop motherboard wherein you can adjust all kinds of clock speeds, voltages, and bus speeds as well as tons of other stuff (DRAM timing, split bank speed on and on), you don't have any of that capability in this BIOS. The NVMe drive is a liteonit CL1-8D512. Its probably middle of the road insofar as speed though this is obviously anecdotal. My western digital Black 512gb in my desktop is a little faster. Don't forget, you can add an internal SSD or 2.5"" hard drive to this laptop. That is kinda cool. Battery life is pretty average under light loads such as internet browsing and typing, I get about 5 hours. Thats not bad considering that this laptop is not an ultra-portable unit with an ultra low power processor and screen. I wish it had G-sync or at least a way to disable the intel graphics, and I wish it had another USB 3.1 gen 2 (type A or C, whichever) port. I think that by now, all chipsets should be running all 3.1 gen 2 (10gbit/sec) by this point. The chipset is comet lake with HM470 south bridge and the processor is socket 1440 FCGBA.",0
"(Child's device! The keyboard is awful.): If you plan on using this Googlebook to type anything, you might want to reconsider and purchase another brand. The keyboard is set up showing all lower case letters and is very different than a normal keyboard. Very much of a children's device with the lack of functions and storage! We wish we would have purchased a real laptop computer for the same price!",0
(Battery life is GREAT!): It is a nice light laptop with great battery life for the price. I certainly couldn't beat it!,0
It is very snappy and the screen is great.,0
the screen takes up pretty much the entire foldable half of the laptop with less than a centimeter of bordering chasis.,0
(Wrong device sent and camera doesn’t work.): I was sent the wrong device and when trying to conduct a google meets meeting I discovered the camera doesn’t work. This device was advertised and shown as having a finger print feature and it doesn’t. Disappointed.,0
"(POS): Yo. My kid was like ""thanks for getting me this lap top for my birthday. For Christmas can we make it work better?""",0
"(Great Little Chrome Book): I ordered through Amazon and received it 2 days later. So far, I’m pleased. It synchronized with all of my google stuff. My docs & photos that are on my phone are also on the HP 360 Chrome which is very cool. I did have to power off then back on because my sound cut out . I it was an app notification that started the issue but honestly can’t say. After I restarted the 360 it’s been fine ever since. I basically will be using it to surf the web, produce & save documents, send emails every now and then and stream movies. Having the USB type C ports are like icing on the cake. Already ordered a 10’ type c to HDMI cord to stream movies to the tv in my RV. The touchscreen is great!! I unplugged it from the power for the day to see how long it will last. It’s been over 12 hours and the battery is no where near depleted. I haven’t been on it the whole time but a good amount of the day. Hope this review helps someone.",0
(Image damaged easily.): Worked well but have never had a computer with such a sensitive screen. Image damaged easily.,0
"(Quit working): This is exactly what I wanted! After the set-up, I closed the top to check out the many ports on the sides. Opened the top again to start trying out my new laptop, and the screen didn't come back on. Tried everything! Even hooked it up to my tv via HDMI. The screen never came back on, but I could see everything on my tv screen. Had to return. Bought October 22. It is now November29th, and I still have no refund or computer. And I can't buy another until I get my money back!! Yes they have the computer and yes, I have called and was told in 2-3 days. That was the week before Thanksgiving. I have never had this happen on an Amazon purchase before. So unhappy make it zero stars!",0
"this is light weight, thin and the overall display is quite nice",0
"(Amazing battery life, great display, very light and portable): I own the UX330 (7th gen), and I love the battery life. I dual boot Ubuntu and run that as my main OS, and I routinely get 12 hours on it. I would highly recommend it for anyone that doesn't need a dedicated graphics card (photo/video editing, gaming) as the battery life is phenomenal.I try to charge it at around 40% and not past 80% to preserve battery life, so I only get about 5-6 hours SOT, but I'm only using 40% of the battery at a time. It charges quickly, 30 minutes or less to get that 40%, and I almost never turn it off, I just let it sleep. I can let it sleep for a couple days and if it drops 1% in that time I'm surprised.The screen angle is a bit annoying, I wish it would go back a bit further (15 degrees more would be great), but its light and it feels durable (not as nice as a macbook, but its half the price).I have had issues sometimes with the trackpad not responding properly, but I believe thats due to Ubuntu. It works wonderfully in Windows, I never have any issues typing in Windows and my hand usually rests on the trackpad, which caused problems with my previous laptop.The USB C is amazing for me, as my phone is USB C, it really makes life easy. Not as big of a plus if you don't have other usb c devices. The mini HDMI is annoying, I still haven't purchased any miniHDMI to HDMI cables.The speakers are in a terrible spot, underneath the laptop, and they're pretty underpowered. Again, in my mind, that would fall under a media machine, which this is not, so its not a deal breaker for me.My girlfriend purchased the 8th gen. It has a slightly more powerful processer, but less battery life. It still lasts a very long time, and she has no complaints.All in all, I love my laptop. Its unbelievably light, and the battery is awesome, and its more than quick enough for anything I use it for, as I don't do anything graphically intensive.",0
"(Great): Excellent all round, can't believe it's a refurbished unit",0
(I love it!): It came in perfect condition and it's a great laptop!,0
Its not as ergonomic as my mac and my hands will cramp up after prolonged use.,0
"Screen is fantastic, sharp clear good colors.",0
"(Good for the first year, then lots of issues): Touchscreen stopped working and the performance also degraded drastically. Couldn't even run basic CAD software, making the laptop useless for work purposes. HP support is absolutely useless, just telling me to do the same ""fixes"" over and over when they have already failed. Buy this if you've got the money to get a new laptop every year.",0
"(Enormous improvement over Microsoft Windows): This computer is such a pleasure to use compared to Windows.1) Extremely easy to set up and get running.2) Virtually no maintenance required, it all happens automatically.3) Very reliableThere you have it, it is the exact opposite of Windows. Chromebooks are a fabulous web surfing option for many people given that Windows 10 has so many problems with updates, often leaving people with non-working computers. MUCH less expensive than Windows also.",0
(Great laptop!!!): Awesome machine. RTX graphics card handles the best games like a stud. Newest i7 chip is fast. Stays cool while gaming. Super sturdy construction. Great screen response time. Just all around great laptop. I have had the GP73 for couple years love it so much bought the GP65 for my son. Amazing laptop for a great price.I have been seriously happy with MSI laptops. Only thing I would change is I bought a 1tb m.2 NVMe ssd for it to beef up the storage space.,0
"(Great laptop, great price): Had my chromebook for a month now. Was a great.price. finding it very easy to use and also to carry around. Set up was a cinch, just put in my Google account and good to go.",0
"(Works great, yet pricy): Works great as a gaming computer. The only concern is the price is expensive.",0
(Not happy): May of had half hr of use screen went blank then never would turn back on. (Battery was full) Been over a week and haven't heard back from seller.,0
"(Worst screen I have seen on a device in recent years): There is a reason this item is priced economically, they really skimped on the screen. There is a mouse pad, but there is not a left or right click button. Not a touch screen either. This is a bare bones item. Not sure why they call it ""Flagship""",0
I like the touchscreen.,0
(One Star): I don’t care for the operating system.,0
My led keyboard has malfunctioned multiple times and the ROG gaming center is just all over the place.,0
Very aesthetic design with the thin bezel and gold lining.,0
"(Over all a great laptop!): I've had this laptop over a year now, and I'm still just in love as the day it arrived! The only slight complaint (If you can even call it that.) Is the battery life is extremely short. BUT. With something so powerful I didn't really expect anything less. I don't see this as something to complain about. I've had it last an hour just listening to music and playing non intensive games, but it's been shorter if I'm playing an intense game or working.Now, on to what really matters. The good. Over all I can't recommend this more. It's worth the money. Easily the best laptop I've owned out of the many I've gone through!- Keyboard is durable, and the back light can be dimmed, or shut off if you prefer. Color cannot be changed.- I've never had any problem with playing games. I have yet to encounter anything that doesn't run properly, or gives a lot of lag or stutter (GTA 5, fallout 4, fortnite, etc.) Even older games like TF2 and star wars battlefront 2 play flawlessly, which sometimes don't go well with newer hardware. Anime games will default to dedicated graphics, so just be sure to change which card they run off of, or it'll be hellish to try to play them.- I've had no hardware issues, this laptop will make using anything without an SSD feel really slow and sluggish in comparison. Nothing's broken and the case is extremely sturdy even after a hard fall onto a wooden floor.- Overheat isn't much of an issue, I did buy a cooling pad just to be safe, but with the push of a button you can make your fans work harder, this will keep it at a nice temp while gaming or working with no worries about the damage that over heating can do!- Not just for gaming either, all my work (Art related, mostly) runs flawlessly, it can run art programs, and game creation software without lag, or stutter. I can run multiple programs at once with no issues. You can run multiple instances of art programs, or have many tabs open without worrying about anything.- There's no scratches, but touching it will leave little 'oily' spots that need to be wiped up. Doesn't happen with the keyboard or track pad but with the casing.- You do have the option to turn off the track pad, speaking of which. I've bought a few laptops now that just simply don't allow this option. It's something I care about as I prefer to use a USB mouse, figure others might as well.-Only has 3 USB ports, but you can use an add on that allows more plug ins.- The built in mic is crisp and clear.",0
"(Asus vivobook S510UA - So far so good!): Bought this laptop after doing many hours of research.... So far I love it!Pros:Super fast boot time.Very little bloatware.Upgradeable Ram.Additional hard drive slot (I got the 250gb ssd version and will probably add a 1tb hdd)While running multiple Google Chrome tabs, watching a video on YouTube, and running a full anti-virus scan the laptop was still silent (fans weren't even noticeable).Laptop stays cool on your lap.Keyboard is quiet.Laptop is super thin and light weight which makes if very portable.Cons:Display isn't that great (this is something I didn't really care about). For $620 you probably won't be able to find any laptop with these specs and a great display. There's always going to be a tradeoff. I chose to downgrade on the display and processor (i got the 8th gen i5 version which is more than enough power for me).Webcam kind of sucks - This is something I really don't care about since I'll probably never use it.Keyboard flex - Almost all ASUS laptops have a little keyboard flex and it was the main thing that scared me about buying this laptop. After using the laptop for a few days, I can officially say that I'm not even bothered by it. It's very comfortable to type with!No numeric keypad - Again something I didn't really care about.Not sure about battery life yet but I'm thinking you can get 6-8 hours out of this thing if you fool around with some settings. This wasn't a big deal to me since I'm always a few feet away from an outlet if I need a charge.Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase! There's so many laptops out there and almost all of them have mixed reviews (which makes it incredibly difficult to pick one).I'll give a 1 month, 6 month, and 1 year update (if I can remember to do so)",0
(Junk): Biggest piece of junk ever. Waste of money,0
(Chromebook): Love this took place of my laptop. But this much more compact.,0
"(All good until it's not.): Bought this laptop in 2020 and everything was awesome until I added an M.2 to the open slot. After adding the M.2 everything worked fine for about an hour then Bluescreen and restart. After restarting the new drive would not be visible or accessible, not even in bios. I updated and followed the suggested tweaks that other people that are having the same issue on the forums. the best I can get out of the Laptop with the new M.2 installed is about 2 reboots a day instead of every hour. When I pull it out the laptop works fine. So, in short, make sure you upgrade your Acer gaming laptops before your warranty is gone.",0

(So far I love the Chromebook): So far I love the Chromebook. It is so lightweight. Packing my laptop through airports etc is not fun. I bought this for use when doing genealogy research. I am planning a trip in May which will include going to cemeteries. With this Chromebook and my phone as a hotspot I can logon to my ancestry account right in the cemetery. I think this is going to work!,0
(Didn’t work out of the box): Right of the box I had a windows error and couldn’t even get onto it the first prompt. I had to spend over an hour on the phone with tech support to totally factor reset the computer. A software issue. It is currently resetting itself. I willbe returning if this didn’t fix it. I shouldn’t of even had to work on it fresh out of the box. Zero stars if I could.,0
"(Do not buy if looking for real AX/wifi 6): Do not believe the listing. It states clearly in several places, wifi 6 certified and 802.11ax. It's false advertising. I bought this in order to be future proofed. I didn't realize it's not wifi 6 until I started having problems months later with the cheap Realtek 8822CE wireless card in the laptop. Look that chip up, it's an AC card, not AX and it can't even do AC wireless properly. It's a cheap wireless chip that drops packets and firmware updates just made it worse. Plenty of people complaining about issues with it and ultimately having to replace it. I'm currently using a cheap USB wifi dongle so I can have a decent connection to work from home. Seller hasn't even responded. Amazon should be going after them for false advertising.",0

"(Died after 2-3 weeks, but update, now fixed after great RMA): Laptop was working perfectly until, after two weeks, it simply died after playing a very non demanding game, kerbal space program. Temperatures were normal and the computer just randomly crashed and then could never post.In order to attempt to fix this on my own I went to take out the battery for 10 seconds. However, the battery casing is very poorly design--its placed inside the case!! Its not like the hp laptops where you can just swap it out easily by pushing a button. No, you have to remove a good 12 screws and take off the bottom panel just to remove the battery. I also sliced open my finger trying to undo all of the annoying latches without breaking the flimsy bottom panel. Oh, and by the way, it took me 10 minutes to realize that there was another screw hidden under the dumb factory seal label!!!! Very annoying and frustrating since it was very stealthily hidden. Lastly, you'll want to make sure you're very gentle when removing the case because it would be very easy to break off the little plastic latches that snap the bottom panel on.Currently put a support ticket into MSI and fortunately I'm within warranty, so I will update this depending on their responsiveness and ability to get my laptop working.So far im very disappointed, but I understand that electronics sometimes have flaws because of the laws of probability, and it may have actually been nvidia's or intel's fault, so I will revert this to 4 stars if MSI solves my problem. It would be 5 stars if the battery wasn't behind the bottom panel.UPDATE:MSI's RMA process was excellent. They did a very professional repair, it looks brand new and runs well. I was worried that they might mess up the thermal paste after putting in a new mobo, but it appears. Apparently there was a crack in the chassis that I did not even know about and they replaced and fixed it to without me even mentioning it! They've done right by me and I am impressed. I would give this 5 stars, but its not quite perfect due to the fact that the battery is on the inside and you have to remove 12 screws to get to hit. Besides that however this is an excellent product. I'll update if this dies again but MSI RMA service was fast and beyond expectation. Including shipping, receiving, them having to get new parts, and them fix it, it only took 2 weeks, and they rushed it so that I could get it before my trip. You won't be dissatisfied with the RMA service if you need it, so you can probably trust that MSI will do right by you. Thumbs up MSI. Killer deal for 899.",0
(Chrome OS): Great Chromebook especially for price only ever owned Windows and Mac PC's but am very pleased with chrome OS and the ease of use.

I wish the screen was larger (15.1), but other than that. It is amazing. With 16 GB RAM it exceeds anything I need, and I imagine this would be a dream for a gamer, especially a teen, who would appreciate the lights on the keyboard more than I do. Easy set up. It is, also, surprisingly quiet. It is a bit pricey, but the performance is top notch so far.",0

(Quick and easy.): Runs nice and quick. Breeze to set up. This is my first Chromebook. Not a complete replacement for a laptop but good for its purpose. No bloat ware which is nice.

"(Great Except for the Screen): This is a solid performing laptop with plenty of power to run the latest software.Pros:Fast. Excellent performance.The i7 processor is powerful and capable.Compact. Everything fits nicely into the 15.6"" size.I like the keyboard and trackpad. Even after coming from Apple laptops.Good selection of ports and jacks.The battery life is good for such a powerful processor.Cons:The screen. I really can't get over the horrible screen. Why did they put it on this otherwise great laptop. It is not very good at all.My iPhone screen is way better than this one. The off angle looks better to me than straight on.I really would consider spending an extra $260 to get a Zenbook with a 4K screen and similar performance specs.If your going to run a second screen this may may work for you. However as a primary carry this is really not that great. You will feel like your back to non-HD TV programming.Otherwise a great laptop. I really don't like giving it only 3 stars but it is really a mis-match of components.",0

"(Acer Aspire 5): I'm not a college trained computer expert by any means so I can't tell you about the different specs or anything like that, but I've been using laptops since dial up was first popular. I've tried many brands in different price ranges over the years to give me experience to fall back on and I have to say that so far, this little economy priced laptop has pleasantly surprised me. It powers on quickly and has been able to handle everything I've thrown at it. That says something because I'm a multitasker and always have a bunch of things going. It handles multiple browser windows open, videos playing or music playing (wear headphones cuz the speakers aren't great) and my favorite writing program all at the same time without bogging. The battery is even decent. On a full battery I made it six hours before I had to plug it in to charge. Not bad. No, it doesn't measure up, head to head, to my other non-Windows laptop, but I don't expect it to. I got it mainly for surfing online, Facebook games, watching videos, and for homeschooling my grandson. All those things it can do with ease. The main thing I miss is a backlit keyboard. It doesn't have one. So what I'm trying to say is if you're looking for a good economy priced laptop running windows 10 that will let you browse the internet, watch a few videos, play simple computer games or homeschool your child, this laptop is a good fit. If, however, you're looking for something to play the bigger more powerful games or do intensive photoshop, you might want to save up and invest in something more powerful. It's a good basic beginner laptop that can be upgraded with more ram and a bigger SSD or HDD if you need the extra space and have the money to spare.The pictures are in low light and better light so you can see the screen is nice but nope, no backlit keyboard. I personally give it 4 stars.",0

"(An Absolute Steal!): The Acer Predator Helios 300 is essentially a portable PS5 that looks nice and sleek. I’m rocking the RTX 3060 paired with Intel Core i7 11-800H. The SSD is blazing fast, powering on and shutting off the device in mere seconds, and paired with 16 gigs of ram makes tasks open quick and multitasking a breeze. There’s a dedicated key for their software which allows you to customize and see everything without needing extra software like preset OverClock stages to choose from, speeds, temps, turbo mode to cool the PC down, keyboard lighting, even boot up logos you can download from the internet and select! The build quality is great on this device, featuring aluminum and plastic, the device feels sturdy. The device comes with a 512 gig ssd but has 2 SSD and 1 HDD expandable slots for use in the case you use it all up! That feature is pretty much unheard of on most high end laptops. Let’s talk gaming though. This PC is a monster to say the least. It’ll play all Modern titles maxed out with stable frame rates over 60-90 without DLSS. Modern Warfare 2019 ram at an average of 90-110fps without DLSS and 115-140 with DLSS on max settings. That’s better performance than a PS5… in a laptop that doesn’t cost too much! I then hopped over to Battlefield 4 where I got a steady 200fps on 1080pUltra with the only dip in fps being multiple explosions going on at once and it wouldn’t dip to more than 160fps which means it would be unnoticeable since the display runs at 144hz. Even Cyberpunk runs at a stable 60fps with DLSS maxed out! The display is nice and smooth. Colors are accurate and with some tuning, can look great! You’ll have absolutely no issues with this laptop, for $1300, this is a steal in my eyes, especially with how the PC market is right now, prebuilt laptops are the way to go at the moment, and the Acer Predator Helios 300 will not disappoint you. I’ll include some gameplay of MW showing how smooth it is!",0
"(Had this for several months, and still think it's a great value): Very pleased with this laptop in terms of speed, noise level, and features. There is a slight amount of light bleed around the edges of the screen, but I don't use it in a dark room so it really isn't a problem for me. One of the reasons I chose this model was for ease of access for a SSD addition as a secondary drive; very straightforward. (I didn't have to remove the motherboard like some competitors do.)",0

This laptop has ruined my life because I now have to hear him play on it 24/7.

"(Good Budget Gaming Laptop): If your looking to game on the go and not spend a fortune this is a good choice.This is a budget machine, it uses AMD chipset and a 4g of VRAM. So it is not top of the line but for most games it just fine. As a bonus it is RTX enabled though you won't squeek out every last pixel of amazement like some higher end models.For most games it is plenty. Minecraft, Genshin Impact at Max settings. Roblox, most of the stuff off Steam.Graphics card aside its got a bright, very saturated screen. Not something you would want to use for photo processing but the games sure look good.Its got good connectivity with USB ports, HDMI out, headphone jack, USB C, Camera (with a turn the camera off switch). It doesn't have a fingerprint reader or SD card slot.On board sound is good, though the speakers are on the bottom of the unit, so that can muffle things a bit.General speed and responsiveness of launching applications, switching things around is good, on par, maybe a tad slower than some other I7 laptops I've used.Whose this for? Someone who wants to game and doesn't want to spend a fortune. You get a decent experience for a good price.",0

"(Nice laptop.): I decided to replace an old windows 8 Dell that finally quit with this Asus. Being familiar with Asus and their tablets I like the brand. I wanted a SSD and reading reviews here I liked that I could add another hard drive as the SSD standard is a M.2. So that leaves a big ol’ slot for a 2.5 SSD (or HD.) Rather than use my old 250gb Samsung SSD because I wanted something new and shiny to go with my shiny new Asus I purchased a new Crucial 500gb 2.5 SSD and a Crucial 500gb M.2 SSD. Both on sale. Why not go all the way!Adding the 2.5” was easy. The only thing is to get the back off remember the screws hidden under the rubber foot pads. (Rear ones only if I remember right, front didn’t have any.) Next I used the software Crucial gives you Acronis to clone the stock M.2 to the new 2.5”. Then I changed the boot order in the BIOS to the 2.5” and swapped the M.2. Next I cloned the 2.5” back to the M.2. Don’t panic Acronis will say it has to restart and it will go into some safe mode looking thing while it clones. That’s it. I prefer the OS to be on the M.2. Maybe that step isn’t necessary? I figured the OS came on the M.2 so why not leave it there. To get windows to see either type “partition” in search and click it. Go through those steps so you see the drive under PC.Very easy to add a HD or swap both. I went to a larger M.2 only because it was on sale. The ONLY thing I don’t like about Crucial is BOTH were made in Mexico. Oh well. The one I replaced in the Asus was Chinese - even worse IMO. All this was very easy to do and if I can do it you can too. I would do a system image and create a restore USB thingy just in case. (Or Microsoft backup disks if you have an external DVD burner.)All in all a nice laptop though all in price wise it wasn’t cheap, but cheaper than anything comparable and Asus gives you a lot of ability to upgrade which I like. It all feels high end though not Apple high end (even with upgrades no Apple high end price.) and is very lightweight. With the upgrades (and even before) I feel like it punches way above its weight class performance wise.",0

"(incorrect product description really only a 32G SSD!): Here is the way the item I purchased was listed -- and the way it is still listed, at this time:Asus Vivobook E203MA Thin and Lightweight 11.6” HD Laptop, Intel Celeron N4000 Processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB eMMC Storage, 802.11AC Wi-Fi, HDMI, USB-C, Win 10However, the computer that arrived only had 32GB eMMC. That effectively renders the computer useless. 64G is the minimum for computers running Windows 10, these days.Actually, it was pretty annoying to have to deal with taking it back.",0
(Great buy!): Definitely a good buy! I work from home and it’s all I needed!,0
"(calidad precio): excelente compra la consegui en oferta por 650 dolares con taxes , luego compre otra memoeria ram y otro ssd y quedo excelnete super rapida",0
(You need to do the research & look at the reviews before purchasing.): It crashes often due to it being very slow. Not what I expected With this lab top.,0
(Great when it works): The good: excellent gaming laptop. Handles anything ive thrown at it.The bad: its possible i got a lemon. There is some issue that has developed the time ive owned it. I suspect the power supply or battery. If it goes to sleep the screen will not turn back on. If you plug in or unplug the laptop the screen shuts off and will not turn back on. If you rest a cell phone on the bottom left hand corner then the screen shuts off and you get a critical pathway failure error. The screen i feel is not as bright as i would like and the sound is not very loud even when maxed out. All in all im having to send it in to acer to have them try and fix it. I would not buy again and quite honestly wouldnt even risk a brand new replacement if i had a choice.,0
(Buena relación calidad-precio): Buena Buena relación calidad-precio,0
"(What the bbbbbbbb): All things considered I think this is a great laptop. Unfortunately, B came off within two days of use and there’s no easy way to fix it. Not a huuuge loss but does speak to less than stellar workmanship. Thankfully b is not as frequently used letter in my vocabbbulary .",0
"(Amazing battery life backed up by an amazing hardware experience): I got the base 256GB 8GB of ram model and this thing does everything I need it to and more. I consider myself fairly tech savvy, so when I heard all the controversy surrounding this model and its slower SSD, I was a little hesitant. After realizing what I wanted to do with the computer, this become a non-factor. I mostly do school (computer science) a little bit of rendering for my 3d printer and some very light gaming. The SSD has never been an issue in my day to day. If you are editing photos or access large files that will need to be read or written to often, maybe go to the 512GB model to get the faster SSD. If you are not working in CAD or video/photo editing all the time you will not care I promise. The rest of this machine has astounded me. 18 hours of battery life is not just marketing, the speed of the M2 is snappy and can handle much more than I thought it would. The new screen is gorgeous. Trackpad is the best on the market bar none. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever felt on a laptop and is an absolute joy to type on. MagSafe is back and amazing as before. Probably my favorite thing about this laptop, coming from a Windows gaming laptop is the lack of a fan. You will lose a little performance, but not having that noise is absolutely astounding. Cannot recommend this thing enough. Great job Apple.",0
"(cliente satisfecho): El equipo llegó el día siguiente a que lo compré, perfectamente empacado y en las condiciones prometidas. El funcionamiento del equipo es muy eficiente, la resolución de la pantalla muy buena y la relación precio calidad supera otras ofertas del mercado.",0
(buy this asap): this computer has a great battery life and it is just like every other computer just smaller size and it is a great brand name. i will do an update in couple of months i have had this for only 3 days,0
"(Great little laptop): Used frequently for over a year. Fast, portable, and great battery life. Touchpad is pretty good. I sometimes play video games at lower settings and it works. This is exactly what I wanted for a modern ""netbook""",0
The windows button is nip picking. No points taken off. It's just annoying.,0
"(Its Decent): The screen quality sucks. But it is a 14 inch screen which is big for a chromebook. Also, it freezes. Idk if that's common for chromebooks but it's annoying. But it's also cheap so you get what you pay for. And where the hell is the caps button?",0
"(Screen sensitivity): In general it functions well. Unfortunately the touch screen is not sensitive enough. I previously used a Lonovo Yoga Book which was much more sensitive. Whether this is a Chromebook issue or computer issue is unknown. However, it can be irritating.",0
"(Great performance for the price!): As the headline states, the little laptop provides great performance for the price. I've been playing games like Borderland's 3 and Doom Eternal on medium-high settings with zero issues. Framerates are buttery smooth. Furthermore, the installed software, like MSI Dragon center, allow me to monitor the system and has settings to prevent the battery from overcharging when left plugged in.My only criticisms are the battery life and the speakers. I only get about 2-2.5 hours of battery life when unplugged. Which is about average with most makes and models at this price point. The sound coming from the speakers is a little ""tinny,"" and lacks bass. However, given what I paid, it's really nothing to complain about. Besides, it can be solved with 3rd party speakers. Other than those two criticisms, the laptop is awesome!In closing, I'm more than satisfied with my purchase and when the time comes to replace the laptop, I'll buy another MSI product.",0
"(Barely three months in and the computer won't even boot properly.): This laptop is great at doing what it does when it works. Unfortunately, despite taking good care of it, it seems that plugging in one more USB than I usually do bricked it.",0

"(Weak hinge): The laptop is great, but the build quality is pretty bad. The hinge on the laptop is weakly bolted to the plastic on the monitor and breaks after a few months. The hinge on the left side came off the plastic a few months ago. I fixed it and glued it back on. Now, the hinge on the right side is broken. It's a hassle having to fix it. It is not a difficult fix, but inconvenient regardless.",0

"(Good.): To put this in layman's terms:... It's really just a tablet with a keyboard and a touchpad.Pros:-Keys feel really, really nice. They're quiet which is a plus in my book.-Keys light up. Good for night owls like me.-Battery lasts an average of 6 hours on full usage. E.g: watching movies, streaming, listening to music, charging cell phone.-ChromeOS: I'm a big fan of the sleek design of Google's OS. Fast and easy navigation.Cons:-It's just a tablet with a keyboard and touchpad.-The screen hinges don't hold the screen up well enough. If I push the screen back to a 45 degree angle the screen will just flop over after typing for a few seconds. Wish they would tighten those hinges.4/5 Good. Wish I would've went with the M5 processor, though.",0
"(Cheapest components in this build!): Had high hopes for this laptop, but it is built with the cheapest components available, yet sold as a premium Asus machine with a premium price tag. I mean really an Intel 660p SSD...",0
"(Decepción): El cargador no servia y algunas teclas como subir/bajar volumen y el brillo de la pantalla no respondían a esta funcion, una lastima ya que me agrado bastante el dise?o y la calidad de construcción pero nada de eso sirve si la computadora como tal no funciona.",0
(Awesone Computer): Very surprised at the quality of this computer.,0
(Excellent Laptop!): As expected,0
(“Perfect” The best computer ever): Perfect perfect perfect. Nothing damaged and I got it for a good price! 100 dollars off at the time. Thank you ??????,0
"(Screen Flickers): The screen was flickering right out of the box. After trying several different driver versions, I asked Amazon to send me a different one. The replacement also flickers, but it is even worse. It makes the laptop unusable. It really is a shame. The touchpad is amazing with multitouch movements. The clicking is super smooth. The matte screen looks great. It is incredibly lightweight. I just cant get over how much the screen is flickering. I am assuming it has something to do with some windows update not liking the drivers. It only flickers on the attached monitor. If I plug in an external one, it is fine. Asus wanted me to spend $15 dollars to ship it to their headquarters. I am going to just return both of them to Amazon and go with a different laptop company. I really wanted this laptop to work for me.",0
(Good product): Quality price is exelent,0
"(Great value/performance for entry level gaming laptop): This is my first gaming laptop in 7-8 years. I am astonished how fast this laptop is even with the base model and the video card only being a 3060. To be clear this is the one I have: Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-54-760S Gaming Laptop | Intel i7-11800H | NVIDIA GeForce 3060.The benchmarks I thought were pretty strong. I am a bit of a power hungry user so the first thing I did was buy more ram and upgrade to 32gb. I also have this as a CON. So bios is locked by Acer so if you do a RAM upgrade you cannot adjust voltages to make sure its running at its fastest. You have to make sure you buy 100% compatible memory and even then the system may or may not recognize and auto adjust to the fastest speed. I went through a few pairs but settled on close to optimal performance.Another quick upgrade I made was adding a 2.5 ssd drive since the included M2 drive is a bit small (but FAST)Pros: Strong CPU, decent GPU, and expandability for more HDs or external devices (many USB 3.0+ ports)Cons: Bios is locked, decent amount of bloatware, loud fans but kinda expected",0
The colors are vivid and accurate.,0
"(Excellent screen quality): Excellent screen quality, user friendly.",0
It's really quick and powerful and runs any game I've played flawlessly.,0
(I like it): Not bad when your connected to the internet. Surprisingly fast for such a small chrome book . Can't beat the price.,0
"(Laptop): Works great, a good quality product.",0
"(MAJOR USB PROBLEM - LAPTOP IS USELESS !!!): All right, I will be contacting Asus and my local computer repair shops but until this problem is resolved the 1 star rating will remain. I am eager to get this problem fixed and then to give this device the excellent product review that it deserves. But with the major problem I've been having with the USB ports this laptop is so unable to do what I need and want it to do, that I would not have paid more than AT MOST $150.00 for it as a back up on the road laptop. Thus far this is the only problem but it is huge.The problem is simple, none of the usb outlets recognize even half of my usb devices. My job requires me to travel and plug into numerous systems, and use numerous devices, all of which do so via USB. I know and respect the difference between the USB 2.0, 3.0, 3.1/Type-C, and Thunderbolt connectors. I have all the external adapters necessary to use any USB type connection on any and all USB ports but while this device lets me use my $1.00 wireless USB mouse it does not allow me to use even something so basic as an external monitor or a host of other common household USB connectable devices. I service a variety of devices that use legacy software systems and more modern systems. I need a USB driver that is compatible with all of these. I have scoured the web looking for tricks to make it work, I have tried all tricks no less than 5 times on 3 separate occasions. I have downloaded all sorts of USB driver software and other USB assistant software, but still I have gotten no results.I am very bothered by this and in need of assistance. I WILL change my review to a very positive one if I get the help I need (because the laptop is great apart from this glaring issue). If not this terrible review will remain. 12/04/2018",0
"(Dead pixel upon arrival): It seems this is a problem that many people have had in the past, but my machine came with a dead pixel on the screen. Of course I could return it, but as I am currently living in Japan, it would take forever, so I contacted Amazon and they were nice enough to give me a partial refund. This doesn't come with an international warranty (thanks Lenovo), so I would have to pay out of pocket to have it repaired here.Without the dead pixel, this product would definitely get 5 stars. It's fast enough for the photo editing that I do, as well as for playing some games here and there.Update: A dotted bar of pixels has appeared at the bottom of the screen. It's clearly a hardware problem. Not worth buying any more in my opinion.",0
(Awsome for price): Very good for price,0
(Good price): Keyboard doesn't light up and no cap lock,0
"(THE BEST WINDOWS LAPTOP OF 2020!): This laptop is fantastic, and overall I am very satisfied with this purchase. But let's talk about the elephant in the room that a few reviewers have already pointed out: ""Is this a new product?"". Given the $2000 price tag, it's only natural to be concerned about the integrity of the product you are receiving. I understand that entirely as I was very concerned myself.For me, the laptop itself was inside its original packaging and showed no signs of being opened before. With that said, the box was a little banged up upon arrival. The laptop itself was wrapped around plastic, and everything inside seemed in place.Now, there is a shipping label on the original packaging box from ""Dell Returns"" located in Lebanon, Tennessee. So I did some quick investigating. I read that most returns for Dell products will get shipped to this Return Center in Lebanon, Tennessee. These returns include order cancellations and unopened returns. Dell Outlet, in turn, sells these ""new unused"" products at a cheaper price tag. So yes, I believe this product is ""NEW"", but it is new under the Dell Outlet standards. This is just my assumption but is the most logical reason I can think of.For me, I have no problem receiving a Dell Outlet product, but it should at least be advertised as such on Amazon. Now, considering all of these factors and even if this is a Dell Outlet product, getting a Dell XPS 15 (2020 model) at this price (~$2000) is a STEAL! You are getting Dell's UHD+ touchscreen infinity display, latest i7 CPU, 1 TB of SSD storage, and Windows 10 Pro. If you were buying this same laptop configuration off of Dell's official website, it run you close to ~$2500. On top of the cheaper price tag on Amazon, there is a 10% back for customers who purchase this laptop on a Amazon Prime Visa card (~$200 back).The laptop itself has solid specs and is built very solidly. The aluminum casing and carbon fiber finish gives this laptop a premium feel. The display is gorgeous and crisp. The touchscreen is super responsive. The track pad is honestly the best I have experienced on any Windows laptop. I personally have NOT had the wobbly track pad issue some users were having.Some issues I do have with the laptop is that it does heat up quite a bit, and you can hear the fans spinning pretty hard at times. Dell has a weird adaptive brightness feature, but you can easily turn this off in the settings. Battery life is less than impressive when you are doing more intensive tasks. I hear the pre-installed McAfee software plays a role in draining the battery, so you could disable it and use the built-in Windows Defender. And while I love the carbon fiber finish (because it gives it an even more premium feel), it is definitely a fingerprint magnet lol.All in all, this laptop is absolutely stunning. The amount of features you receive for the price that you buy this laptop at outweighs the minor issues that I have pointed out.",0
"(Gaming laptop for the 40+ crowd that isnt Crazy Looking): So Im a 40+ year old MAN, that likes to game! I also do a lot of traveling so I need a laptop that can game while Im on the road, and use in a professional manner. Sadly this is a difficult thing to find! Not to mention affordable! My last laptop I had was an Asus gaming laptop that had the words ""Pit Viper"" emblazoned on the front lid of it. And guess what.....Im now known around the office as Pit Viper! Which may seem cool, but when you explain to people why they are calling you that it looses its luster real quick! So farewell to that.My old pit Viper laptop however was no slouch. It had a 2060 GPU and a Ryzen 4900HS processor. It played games excellently, but looked absolutely silly and more like a childs toy than an actual tool. I figured with this laptop the minor upgrade to a 3060 would be very nominal, but boy was I wrong. It turned out to be a huge improvement for the 2060. The 3060 runs coolers, has much much higher FPS and benches significantly better. Now the CPU on the other hand of this model definelty has its trade offs. It is by no means as fast or as mean as my old 4900hs, but it does use a lot less power than the 4900hs which when you are presenting and dont want to plugin is especially a bonus. However its just no where near as robust as the 4900hs was. Evreything else about this laptop is pretty spot on and pretty run of the mill. The screen is great, with massive refresh and great brightness. It is clear with no lagging or dead pixels. The keyboard has good actuation and not like the short throw macs or other ultrabooks. Battery life is about what you expect out of gaming laptop. For gaming your only going to get about 40 minutes of of this. But for general word processing and work this is really where this Intel processor shines and you get an easy 4+ hours out of single charge, which my old AMD asus would only get about 2.5 at very best. Predictably the laptop is pretty thick as it needs a lot of room to run those fans and vent the hot air, but its still very compact and not terribly heavy. As like everything there are always pros/consPros;-Incredible value for what you get, hundreds cheaper than its comparable brethren-Huge improvement leap with 3060 over 2060 and below-Runs cool with no throttling-Intel processor sips power and is great for long work sessions-Looks great and doesnt look like a normal silly looking gaming laptop.Cons;-Intel processor while good isnt great, you have to trade off for battery life-Still made of plastic. However at this price point what do you expect?-Power brick is massive. Weighs nearly as much as laptop itself. You also cant go without bringing it so you are always trucking it along as well.-Acer bloatware is clunky. However easily deletedAll in all for a value priced laptop with high end components there is no equal. Its also great for the ""adult"" crowd who aren't interested in silly lighting or goofy pictures on the unit. It can easily be used in a professional environment just as much as a gaming session. I am incredibly happy that I can get away from my old nick name as well. RIP Pit Viper (you wont be missed)",0
Screen is always flickering blank Idk why.,0
"(Buy one, you won’t regret it!): I had a 2008 MacBook Pro that I used until 2014. I then switched back to a PC until purchasing this M1 MacBook a month ago. I don’t know why I haven’t been using a Mac sooner. Having messages and FaceTime and synced with my phone, along with MS office functionality makes this computer a dream to use.Only issue I had was using a usb c to display port plug to plug into my monitor. Worked great until the latest update of Big Sur. Have an open case with Apple and they seem perplexed, but a quick review of reddit shows this seems to be an issue with the M1 chip. I ended up purchasing a usb-c to hdmi adapter and have had no further issues, except being out $15 for the first cable.",0
"(Highly suggest !!): Quick start up and fingerprint sensor is arguably more reliable than that of a cellular device. Screen is not as bright as a more expensive laptop but is bright enough to still find myself squinting when I open it at night. Smooth running, decent battery, overall a VERY good budget laptop!!",0
"(Disappointing): I stopped buying HP in 2008 after purchasing one of their top-of-the-line laptops and having nothing but trouble with it from day one. With that I had to struggle with support several times over the course of the next three months before they agreed to take it back and replace it -- when the replacement arrived, I sold it on ebay and decided not to buy HP anymore.Fast forward 13 years and I figured it was time to try them again for one of my new employees. We've been using Dell but I figured I'd save a few hundred and try HP again... a regrettable decision. She's had to call support multiple times and is losing work time trying to chase down HP's quality issues.Unfortunately I can't return it at this point and will probably wind up replacing it before the year is out. Looks like it's time to go on another 13 year hiatus from HP. Just glad I got my reminder this way instead of deploying a bunch of these at client sites and having a support nightmare.I'm giving it 2 stars, because the casual user may find it sufficient...but if you expect to use this 8 hours a day, you may want to consider a different brand.",0
(My ASUS laptop shuts off randomly non-stop): I just bought the product a few months ago. From the start it started shutting down. First I thought it must be a software issue or a weird update...

After numerous days of research this is definitely a great Chromebook for the money the display is excellent and the keyboard works well I also like the fact this includes an HDMI port. Battery life last around 9 hours and it is extremely light. The speakers which are on the bottom put out good sound. Do some research before you buy because a Chromebook though it can do a lot is not a PC but for the price and what it does do is completely worth it. Browse the web, word, excel, and spreadsheet Google alternatives and cloud storage work excellent. Does not need an internet connection to do everything and anything dive offline will be saved and uploaded once you connect to wifi.

"(Great laptop but not without minor flaws): I love this laptop. I am a desktop PC gamer but I travel from time to time and I want to game from hotel rooms. I purchased this for the price and 2070 graphics card. Lets just start out and say this is faster than my desktop. I have an i5-8400 coffee lake and a gtx 1080. I was hoping it would keep up with the 1080 but this passes it with COD Warzone on the same settings. Temp if you are wondering was 91 degrees. Don't notice the fan noise with headphones. I also use the same monitors I use on my desktop with this and they were super easy to setup.The issues I have with it are minor.Only 1 USB on the left. The other 2 usb are on the right in the way of the mouse in my opinion. Depends what you plan on attaching. I have a usb hub so I was able to work around it easily.Second gripe, it does attract fingerprints on the top. Not a huge deal, but I do notice them.",0

Using the chromeOS takes some getting used to but it’s simple really.It is lightweight.The screen and speakers seem like where they built to a price point.

"(Nice): Great laptop, works fast and just as I expected. Good value",0
(Wrong charger): Got the wrong charger,0
(Great for college): Great computer for college. Small and effective. Short batter life though,0
"(Fast, and reasonably priced): The specifications of this laptop are very well considered. There is enough memory, enough SSD space, and a big, bright glorious screen. The power supply is rather large, but is thin for easier packing. The only downside I can see is runtime when it is not powered and is running just on battery is limited, but if you will be leaving it plugged in most of the time, this shouldn’t be an issue. The keyboard is nice, too, and is full-sized, which is rare on a laptop. Recommended.",0
"(Dollar-for-dollar best laptop to buy): 1. The components are excellent - 16GB RAM @ 3200 MHz, 512GB NVMe SSD, 1660TI, Ryzen 4800H.2. The cooling solution is phenomenal. Giant air vents behind/below/left/right of the laptop blow out a ton of hot air. Even when the Ryzen 4800H was at max turbo speed playing XCOM 2, the CPU temperature barely exceeded 80C.3. The display is 144HZ, and its purdy. Bright screen, vibrant colors, and the gray-to-gray response time feels good too (no noticeable ghosting).4. I dig the blocky, low-key aesthetic. Nothing on this laptop screams ""edgy 12 year old,"" (besides the name ""Legion,"" which I guess is still better than having ""Predator"" or ""Republic of Gamers"" stamped on your laptop).5. It's heavier than a macbook air, but it doesn't feel unwieldy in your hands. And it go fast and cool.Learned a way to modify the registry editor to unlock a hidden power plan that prevents the Ryzen 4800H from ever going above its 2.9GHz base clock, and it's amazing. I'm hitting the same FPS on games because the GPU has more thermal headroom, and my CPU temp dropped from 80C to 60C.Haven't used this thing on battery yet, but from what I've heard it isn't great. Hoping capping the CPU speed at baseclock will help, but you don't get a gaming laptop to play on the battery anyhow.If you're looking for a gaming laptop to buy, this is the one to get.",0
(The beast at its best): The lap is awesome to give 5 star. But the heating issue just like other gaming laptop's are present here but i didn't face any thermal throttling or something wish it was much better,0
(Five Stars): Battery life is superb,0
"(Extremely satisfied with my purchase): Great laptop for the price. Speakers could be a little louder, but I've got a Bluetooth speaker. The finger reader is amazing and easy to use.",0
"(Mode ""S"" marketing trick): Didn't know what mode ""S"" was when I bought this thing. AFTER it got here I was treated to the sensation that staying in mode S relegated me to a glorified and overpriced Chrome book! Seriously, this mode will NOT ALLOW you to download any app that's NOT A Microsoft approved app that can ONLY be installed on YOUR MACHINE by the Micro Czar's appstore!!!! That includes any other browser you may be fond of! Total bummer, right up to I canceled mode S and went back to what I usually do and use on MY machine. Nuff said!",0
"(Easy computer): Brought this chromebook about a year ago. It all the computer I need for what I do. It is quick, battery life is good and recharging is fast. Touch screen works well. I do use a mouse, mostly because it is my preference. Only problem with the touch screen is I have problems closing out tabs with touch - maybe my fingers are too big? Overall I love how easy it is to use.",0
"(Velocidad del procesador): Muy bien el desempe?o y muy fácil de configurar, sobre todo si cuentan con cuentas microsoft o microsoft 365. El ventilador si hace un poco de ruido pero normal para ser ultradelgada. El color azul del equipo se ve mucho mejor en físico que en las fotografías.",0
"(Super fast): My daughter has used this laptop for the last year, primarily to game on. So far, every game she's thrown at it flies. The main game she's been playing is GTA (one of the versions). Never heard a complaint from her about it.I'm in software development, and yes, this can easily be used for that as well. When we first got the laptop, I spent about an hour and a half to reset the computer to bare Win10 with no ""extra"" bloat. This could be the reason the laptop is so fast (never ran it stock from the manufacturer so couldn't give you a comparison).Overall, extremely happy with the laptop. Would recommend",0
(Niece loves it): Bought for my niece for school - she loves it. works well.,0
(Light weight): Love the new button feature of the chrome book.,0
It's intended for gaming and offers very fast refresh so you won't see ghosting effects while gaming.,0
"(Great value for the price.): For the price, one of the best you can get. Fans are loud, my screen has some backlight bleed and the power block on the cord is huge. But this laptop is exactly what I wanted, a reasonable price for a 10th gen i7 and a RTX 2070. One thing I don’t like is the speakers, they sound very muffled/tinny but I tend to use headphones anyways.",0
(Currently using for college): I know nothing about technology but it was been a 99% great experience as for it being smooth and running well. My only issue is that the audio has been terrible ever since I took it out of the box. Great for college students though.,0
(Letters and numbers on keyboard are difficult to read): My only complaint with this 15.6 inch HP laptop is that the letters and numbers on the keyboard are very difficult to read. I had to buy a keyboard cover with black letters and numbers so I could read the keys.,0
"(Takes a bit to get used to): Purchased this primarily for video editing, never used a MacBook before however I had experience with their pro iPads and phones. Coming from windows it did take some getting used to, but overall enjoying the video editing aspect.",0
(Best lightweight performing business laptop I’ve used): exactly what I was looking for... meets my needs and expectation,0
(Five Stars): The notebook is very powerful and stable. It worth more than the price.,0
"(Good Purchase): This is now my every day at home use computer. The only problem that I have is the hinge is still a bit stiff, I think this will fix itself over time.I am very happy I picked this Lap T op.",0
"(Refurbished): It was a good cheap computer, so good and cheap I went for one on amazon when the clearance section sold out at beat buy, I read the reviews about these being refurbished without advertising so, probably could have got refurbished for under $100. Anyway slate was wiped pretty clean but just found that this new chromebook has been synced to some speaker I don’t own. Fuxk these guys I’m gonna live with my cheap ass computer. Good luck out there.🤦‍♂️👍",0
(Great Value): The materials of the laptop feels great and it has and excellent perfomance with autocad and revit,0
"(I am so upset. I regret buying this. ...): I am so upset. I regret buying this. It is so limited, I can't even use it for what I bought it for. I'm going to try to figure out how to replace it...",0
"(Terribly battery life, but ultimately that didn’t matter.): Possibly a defective unit but the laptop stopped working after two days. Apparently running google chrome and trying to open the start menu is too much for an advanced gaming laptop: it froze and I had to hard restart it. After which it didn’t actually pull up again, just cycled at the login.Also the battery life was terrible, and a half hour of typing in Microsoft word and the battery had dropped from one hundred percent down to twenty three percent. As I said, I might’ve gotten a defective unit, but is that a chance you want to take? I was able to return the device for a return. Won’t be buying another one.",0
(One Star): Very disappointed! This laptop only worked for two weeks.,0
(Excellent value): Excellent value for the price. Had everything I needed tbh,0
"(Quick & Simple): I bought this HP to upload and edit videos/ stream tv / and download music & it does all of that with ease. I'm impressed with how fast it runs. I've had zero problems with it so far.The screen quality is clear and vibrant. All functions work perfect. It's very simple to set up.You basically unbox it, set your preferences and it's ready to go!Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a reliable, fast laptop.",0
"(Smooth experience. Top build quality): I got it as a gift for my wife and she loves it. Though I'm not into the Apple eco, I am really impressed by the build, popping screen, and sleekness. I guess those are the general expectations.If Linux is not a must for you, I really recommend you go for the Macs.Shipping and handling were on point.",0
"(Stopped Working after 3 months): My computer won't turn on, I don't know if it's the charger or the actual computer but it stopped working.",0
"(Awesome laptop for the price!! Very fast and quite lightweight.): I am really pleased with this purchase! The i5-9300H & NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 in conjunction with NVMe SSD makes for a very fast boot and snappy overall performance. I was VERY pleased to see that this contains a Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) network card in addition to a traditional gigabit wired Ethernet port. The backlit keyboard is a very nice feature, particularly when using this in low-light situations such as on an airplane. For being a thin and light laptop, I was pleasantly surprised to see all the ports on it (USB 3.1 Type-C, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0, RJ45, etc.).I use this for general computing in a mix of personal and business use. The performance has been top-notch and on par with my expensive Dell tower PC at work. The speakers are notably nicer (louder and clearer) than my previous Acer laptop.If you are in the market for a reasonably priced 15.6” laptop, look no further. This is a great buy!!",0
"(Very Nice): Just what I was looking for, Fast , Light and Great Screen !",0
(Not Good for Gaming or General Use): For the price this product looks like it has great value but I wouldn't recommend it. With just general use the computer became scorching hot. Using any application that used the graphics card made the computer too hat to touch on the bottom and the keyboard was barely usable because it felt like your fingers were in an oven.,0
"(DONT BUY AMAZON USED): I bought this laptop for school and casual gaming. Not 30 minutes in it crashes, I updated the drivers which helped but I couldn’t even run Minecraft for more than a minute. Refurbished my ass, had to pay extra to ship to MSI to fix. Would give it one start but I called support and they were very nice and covered the cost to ship it to msi??",0
(not fast enough): not enough memorytoo slow,0
"I was pleasantly surprised to encounter a light weight, very versatile and downright peppy performance on this new model.",0
"(Battery is 90 watt hours and I am impressed, amazing build quality!): Runs like a laptop with an RTX 3070 should run. Screen looks great and everything I’ve ran on it functions super well. The ability to change graphic profiles and turn the cooling system up or down on the fly is awesome. Thanks MSI for making another amazing product!",0
"(Fast, easy to set up, convenient): Acer computer is efficient, quick, and easy to connect to the internet. Support help is available. The user manual was not included as described in the write up, but the computer is like new in original packaging.",0
"(Dead on arrival): Dead on arrival, many other users have same issue, it looks like there is no QC.",0
(Don’t buy it you’ll waist your money!!!): This computer my first day of using it the screen turned black and it didn’t come on st all. Am so disappointed I saw so many good reviews but mines didn’t work,0

"(I love it !): My old Hp laptop went out and I'm a college student so I needed something right away . This laptop came and it is so lightweight and sleek and feels so good. I love it, the design is good, the keyboard has a wonderful feel to it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a laptop in a pinch. This is such an upgrade from my previous laptop and I love it !!",0
(Beware! It lasted less than 18 months): Purchased in Feb 2018. Died June 2019. Game chip was fried. Company offered to repair for more than asking price. Beware!Used mostly on desk and was not miss-handled.,0

The model I purchased came with the GTX 1060 and can play most games on high,0
"(Wish I would have gotten one of these sooner): So I am a long time Android user, and have been very hesitant to get a Chromebook. One of my friends had one about 8 or 9 months ago, and he raved about it, but I still did not pull the trigger. Well, I recently took a trip overseas and needed at a small, long battery, device, and this fit the bill. I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised. In fact, the battery lasted the entire 9 hour flight, with a little bit to go. The most surprising feature about this, was the fact that when I opened up the lids, within 3 seconds, I was able to log in and get on the computer. if you are an Android user, you will not skip a beat. Even if you're not, there is a very minimal learning curve. If you're worried that you will not be able to do any of your office work, it has Google office, Microsoft Office, or a bunch of other different offices suites. I put a 256 gig micro SD card in it right away, dropped a few videos on it, and was ready to roll. The only thing I did do was put a hard shell case on it and a glass screen protector. The one thing I will caution you, is do not throw away the silver clip with the little white things in the bag that is inside the box. I actually threw them away, then realized that they were replacement tips for the pain. Was able to save them. The pain, quite frankly, is one of the neatest things. You are able to draw so fine of a line, it's not even funny. My daughter saw mine, needed a new laptop for school, and took a dive and got one also. She got the exact same setup. Thrill on my research, this one is one of the best ones. Much better processor also. The only picture I could not find, which I took, was of it in tablet mode. It does close flat, but not a nice neat clamshell flat. You can see from the picture that it doubles up on both sides. This is not a problem, but just wanted to show it. I am very happy that I got this, and look forward to using it for a very long time.",0
This is a light and thin laptop,0
"(Would Not recommend): I got a refund very easily, but with my experience, the OS was not downloading properly and my laptop kept shutting off and turning back on while I’m in the middle of doing my work. Would not really recommend.",0
"(A sharp knife for productivity): Lightweight, a keyboard with good touching feeling, heat distribution is good, and the fan is not noisy with a fast CPU and ssd, making it an excellent productive machine.",0
(Disappointed): Disappointed. Very cumbersome to use. Using for editing document is terrible. Not compatible with my printer. Won’t download adobe app. Can’t find the book. My documents have disappeared. No right click.,0
(Works great except USB port): I love this laptop. It’s so lightweight and easy to use. I do a lot on it for work and school and have had no issues with storage capacity and it’s super fast. Great resolution.The USB port only sometimes works which is annoying. I’ve done some research and not sure if it’s a trend with this type of laptop or what but you have to hold down to power button to almost trip it back into working. I don’t often use my USB so I haven’t gotten it fixed yet but it is a concern when getting a laptop online since there’s no in person tech support to bring it to.,0
(Terrific): Everything was as promised....love my new laptop,0
"(Good laptop for the price!): For my limited usage, this is more than adequate. If you're in a rush , this might not be your best bet!",0
(Like it a lot after Lenovo problems): Like it eas easy to fire it up,0
(Good product): It works fine for school work.,0
"(Read this before buying.): I purchased this laptop in 2019 from B&H online. In total after tax I paid $2,078.99. The only difference is mine had an Nvidia gtx 2070 gpu rather than the 2060 gpu. I can't believe the markup on computer parts lately. Just bear that in mind. Also this laptop runs really hot when pushed on high settings in games and the exhaust vents are on the sides rather than the bottom.",0
(Easy to Use Computer): Very good computer for home use.,0
"((Updated 9/17/18) - All-Rounder Sleek Laptop - Defective Luck): (UPDATE 9/17/18) Tested the laptop thoroughly with random gaming, video streaming from Amazon Prime movies while on battery mode. System will completely blank out the screen with no system response unless you hold the power button down. When turning the system back on and log back into Windows, the screen would flicker a lot for maybe 10 seconds then look perfectly fine afterwards. This issue continued at random with the same blank screen issue. Battery had about 50% capacity at the end. House has an ambient temp of 77 degree F with a ceiling fan for the controlled environment. Sad but I will be requesting a return and hopefully a replacement to give this wonderful system class another go. Depending on the QA ethics at ASUS, there might have been no thorough thermal testing and extensive benching before system was packaged for any possible software/hardware defects.(UPDATE 9/14/18) Wife reported that the system has randomly shutdown twice this week while on battery during work. Considering a request for a replacement. Dropping down the level of quality for this product of a brand name with another star drop.(UPDATE 9/11/18) Wife complained that the screen would turn off and had to completely force shutdown to restore. Issue still occurs when on battery mode and power was over 60% charge.Created a Disk Image of current system and started updating majority of the system driversIntel Chipset/Wifi/BTIntel VideoNvidia GPUDisk CleanupWill follow-up later if this helps. Might consider a laptop replacement for a crappy deployment as the initial Windows Logs in the System log files shows a good amount of errors occurring when the instance of the screen turned off for a driver issue of some sort. To lazy to investigate further.(UPDATE 9/7/18) After the 1st week of usage, the system will randomly power down into a sleep state in battery mode. Ran the Asus BIOS Updater and found Version 300 2018/08/21. Initially Version 206 2018/06/21. Tested system in battery mode again with all Office 365 applications opened and Adobe Creative Suite apps such as Acrobat and Illustrator running to replicate what the wife was suffering through when she complained about the sleep/power down issues. System seems stable for now.Was patient for ASUS to refresh their Zenbook Pro as the UX550VE model was nice but it was at it is end of life. Was hoping to find a decent all-rounder laptop with a GTX 1060 that was under 5lbs and around 15"" of screen space but this was fitting the needs properly. After reviewing gaming performance on the GTX 1050 Ti against the 1060, give and take. The UX550GE has a nice body but it will leave evil finger marks on the exterior. The fingerprint reader works nicely for the unlocking Windows and the setup process was straight forward. Please note, since I work in IT as a Desktop Engineer, I seriously hate Win10 with the Cortana features and telemetry crap. ASUS Win10 Image is current 1709 latest release.Played Blizzard Heros of the Storm and Starcraft II. The Intro videos did display some minor distortion on the 4K screen but it held up find for the most part. Have not been able to test 4K movies yet but hoping it will be smooth.Accessories include a microfiber cloth, a spare power velcro tie, Ethernet dongle.Some Notes on the side, I have worked on various Lenovo desktop and laptops, MS Surface Books, Surface 3 and 4, MacBook Pros and they have their Pro/Cons. I must say for the ASUS Zenbook Pro, this laptop series will fair well for good content creation and part-time video gaming.PS: This is for my Wife so I am jealous of her now!",0

(Awesome budget gaming laptop): it is a really nice laptop for the price. It does have the option the change the colors on the keyboard.,0

"(wouldve got 5 stars if it wasn't for the charging cable): owned one of the prior year laptop strix scar, basically the same look and hardware base minus the updated graphics card, processor, and screen. The only flaw i noticed with these laptops is that the charging cable starts to become unfunctional after a year or so and replacements barely last a year due to minor movements with the laptop, sometimes im away at my desk and like to use it that way while its charing which contributes to the wear and tear of the cable which i barelly tug on it or at all.ASUS needs to work on the way they charge this laptop cause the design of the charging cable is flawed and stops charging due to minimal wear and tear. I replaced the charging cable like 3 times in the past 2-3 years.",0

I'm also amazed that I can play wow and also minimize it while scrolling for recipes, fb etc without things freezing or extreme lag. This is the first gaming laptop I've ever had, so maybe my expectations are low to begin with but I really love it. The only thing I worry about is the charger. It's gets pretty hot. Maybe someone can answer that question for me about the heat. I also don't like that I can't choose to have the red backlight for the keyboard on without it shutting off. Other than those two things, I love this laptop. Seems like a beast so far lol",0

"(Best Value Ultrabook): This laptop is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I needed something that was light, sturdy, portable, fast, and good on battery life.Build:This laptop is sturdy with hardly any flex to be found. The exterior of the laptop is metal and looks quite nice. The inside is a premium grade plastic. The laptop is extremely solid when closes and I have no worries throwing it into my backpack. It is extremely light and hardly noticeable on my back. The keyboard is surprisingly nice to use (I had expected it to be bad, but boy was I wrong).Screen: The 13 inch ultrabook screen size is perfect. I used to have a 17 inch display but I do not miss it after having the portability of the 13. I do not have any trouble reading the display. The display gets plenty bright for me in nearly every condition. It is sharp and just all around good looking.Battery: This batter lasts far longer than I ever expected it to. Even on the highest performance settings, I can expect it to last about 4 hours. By turning down the brightness of the keyboard and screen, I can get easily over 9 hours of continuous use of of this thing.Speed: Make sure to get the Intel 8th gen chip. Do not settle for the 7th gen or anything less. The 8th is at least a 40% improvement over the 7 and it shows. This thing is lightning fast. It holds many chrome tabs and programs with ease. I have absolutely no problems with the speed of this device (and I am very picky).Price: Anything cheaper than this will have a significant drop in reliability and build quality. You can get other laptops for cheaper, but I wouldn't. After examining many of its competitors (Dell XPS 13, HP Envy, etc.), I can truly say that this is the best value. Other well known ultrabooks do a fantastic job and may improve slightly over this device, but it will come at a much greater cost.Gaming: Extremely light gaming is doable on this laptop but that is definitely not it's intended purpose. If you expect this to be your main computer as a gamer, you should look elsewhere. Ultrabooks just aren't made for that. You will still need to invest in something with a dedicated graphics card and an i7. I use this laptop when I am away from my gaming desktop.",0

So far I really like this computer, the screen and keyboard are both really great. That said if you are buying this for the built in speakers, look elsewhere they are not very good, just wear headphones... really. Like another reviewer, I have been searching for a few months now for a good value gaming laptop. The fact that this has at 2070 and a 10th gen i7 makes me very happy. I could not find another laptop with these specs at this price.",0
(Nice chrome book.): I like this chrome book but it is a little heavier than my old Acre. But for the price with 32gb memory it is worth the money.,0
"(and all I can say is its the best laptop I've ever had): I've purchased this quite some time ago, and all I can say is its the best laptop I've ever had! the speed and multitasking is crazy!",0
"The way the replacement unit behaved, makes it a likely and very uncomfortable possibility.",0
(Great laptop): I got this for $500 and it's really great! Fast and does everything I need for work. I love that the screen is so big,0
(No me gusta que el chofer siempre votan las cosas y no son cuidadosos): Esta bien,0
"(wait before you buy): found it complicated and deprecated quickly. The purchase price for me was 1000 saw it at 90 less 2 months later now it's almost $200 less. Don't feel too good about this,",0
(Important !!): Before purchase anything watch my video. I bought a laptop. But laptop’s keyboard doesn’t work. I spent a lot time for this freak machine.,0
"(I loved the price.): I love everything about my Cromebook, I'm very pleased.",0
"(Great Chromebook): I'm very pleased with the quality of this Chromebook. Fortunately I haven't had any issues staying connected to wifi as others have had mentioned in their reviews. My biggest concern was going from a Windows OS to a Chrome OS, but it wasn't a difficult transition at all. I'm still able to use Microsoft Word through the Word Online app as I use Word for many things. I recommend this Chromebook to anyone who needs a simple laptop to search the internet, watch movies, listen to music or homework.",0
(Pretty good): First pc ive ever gotten and its pretty good for someone like me who is new.,0
(Great Computer): So far it's great! Google Chromebook - that's what it is! Great value.,0
"(Overall, kind of a letdown): This product is originally listed for $549.00. Sure I didn’t pay that, but this product is in no way worth the listing price. I wish I would have gone and gotten one with a bigger screen too. Overall, it was kind of a letdown....",0
"(Really Exceeded my Expectations): This laptop really exceeded my expectations. I am receiving a warranty extension from ASUS for giving my feedback however I genuinely recommend this product for anyone who is looking to do gaming and be mobile at the same time. It is very light for its purpose, specs and quality.",0
(Good buy): So far so good cannot get the touch screen to work have to use touch pad but it works perfectly otherwise,0
"(Shameful practices and defective item): Product is defective and seller refuses to do anything because we missed the return window by TWO DAYS. Chrome book will not charge and just says “calculating” in battery bar. We received the item Mid July, but admittedly didn’t even open the box until last week because it was to be used only for virtual homeschool. That started Monday morning and by Tuesday morning the thing was dead as a door knob. I essentially bought a over priced paper weight for my child. I reached out to the seller myself AND asked Amazon to step in and help and the seller is still refusing to do anything. During a pandemic, when lots of families are having to shell out funds they don’t have for devices like this. Shame on this company!!!",0
"(Power-hungry lightweight desktop replacement): I've had this for about a month and a half. I wanted a gaming laptop that wouldn't break the bank and I was concerned about cooling. This came highly recommended due to the ""Cold Front"" cooling system from Lenovo that is more intuitive than some other laptop cooling. So far, I am impressed. It runs games well, but expect to have it plugged in or performance will be severely stunted for gaming since the graphics chip is very power-hungry. For reference, this machine seems to draw 120-170W when plugged in and the graphics chip is powered up--a level of power deliverable by the 230W power supply but not by the smaller battery. The other complaint is that the chiclet keys feel a little sticky sometimes and the touchpad isn't very user-friendly. It works for non-gaming applications, but for gaming, bring a keyboard a mouse. Otherwise the performance is great and it runs fairly cool as promised.",0
The screen is fabulous and the overspeed fan keeps it cool under pressure.,0
(solid gaming laptop for the price): Easy to upgrade. Added another TB of NVME m.2 and 32gb of ram to the base model and it was much cheaper and probably better components. Runs 1080 low to mid in 144 frames in just about everything,0
"(Good for price): Good laptop for the price., I was surprised. Touch screen works well. Great for someone wanting to browse the internet, email and play a few games. Easy to use and set up.",0
(Broke within a month): I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. Within the month the screen had shattered. We are very careful with our electronics and the screen cracked just from opening. This is not a durable laptop.,0
"(Best balance between performance and price out there.): Laptop is exactly what I hoped/expected it to be. Light, solid design, compact, and performs well for both streaming and some of the modelling software I use in grad studies. As other reviewers have mentioned, the touch pad is mediocre. However several reviews have complained about fan noise and I have not found it to be an issue. The fan starts up when I run multiple heavier programs, but I don't find it gets overly loud consistently.",0
"(Wifi stopped working 4 months in): I never write reviews. Ever. But I am so disappointed after having this laptop for 4 months, the wifi stopped working. Nothing even shows up for connections. The touchpad/mouse is also not great to use, it is very touchy and ends up doing really strange things.",0
(Good): This was easy to set up and it is easy to use. It has been reliable and I am happy with it.,0
"(Keyboard Doesn't Work, wasted money.): The keyboard is completely messed up. Was online with support forever trying to fix it and had a pro look at it. Both concluded it was manufactured poorly. I can't type and it's past 30 day warranty/return policy from where i got it. :/",0
"(Fantastic Product!): The best investment I made all year. I play every game I want on the Ultra High graphics, runs like a champ. I do all my work on it and the light weight makes it easy to carry it around every day, whether to the office or out on the road during a business trip. Runs really fast, I've used it for one year thus far, and never had any hang ups.",0
"(Minimal packaging): Appreciate how little ""extra fluff"" is included with the package.",0
(Lap top was easy to set up): Granddaughter was please with easy set up,0
"With a dedicated video card, 512GB SSD, and 16 Gigs of RAM this machine is LOADED for the price you pay.",0
(Lightweight and reliable battery life!): Love my slim light laptop. Easy to carry and transport! Reliable battery life! I miss not having a cd/dvd but it’s worth the light weight and I got a separate external dvd drive!,0
"(En verdad es una Air!!!): La compré para actualizar mi iMac de casi 10 a?os que ya anda algo lenta. La nueva iMac no me agrada su dise?o, así que también por presupuesto adquirí esta MacBook Air M1 a muy buen precio, es muy ligera lo cual hace que pueda transportarla fácilmente. Es realmente rápida comparada con mi antigua Mac y con la compu del trabajo.El principal uso que le doy es ofimática, algo de dise?o de fotos y videos, navegar en internet, Spotify, YouTube, correos, Netflix y así.Cuando la configuré al inicio, se calentó bastante sin aparentemente estar haciendo nada y me preocupé pero leí que es normal al configurar la laptop por primera vez, después que ya quedó lista, ocupó de varias horas eso sí, no ha vuelto a molestar con altas temperaturas.Ahora bien, no es que le he dado un uso intensivo así que no podría decir si en realidad se calienta mucho al llevarla a un uso extremo. Como aun no es mi computadora principal, no la uso mucho a diario, por lo que me ha durado la batería, después de cargarla al 100 %, casi una semana llegando al 15 % al quinto día sin apagarla de un día para el otro, solo la cierro y la uso al día siguiente; hago esto porque he leído que así funciona mejor Mac OS.En unos meses pienso realizar una actualización de esta opinión de usuario.Ahhhhh!!!, de ley consigan un USB-C hub, yo compré uno con 3 USB-A y una entrada para ethernet.",0
(Charger for my Samsung chrome book): My chromebook charger was lost that I purchased in 2020.Can I purchase another charger for my Samsung chrombook.,0
"(My new travel buddy!): Compact, extremely light and portable. This is the ideal travel buddy if you just need to keep in touch and be able to conduct virtual transactions on the go. It is a fast little machine, and even though it is tied to Google Chrome, it is not as limiting as I thought it would be. Connects to internet anywhere, allows me to stream video and audio content with ease.",0
"(wow): great laptop. nice design, light weight, fast. 1 year later, so far so good.",0
"(Great laptop but needs to be upgraded to run smoothly): If you don’t upgrade the ram from 32 to 64 your fans will be running nonstop and the laptop will get hot and run slow. But once updated all that won’t happen anymore. Also it only comes with a 512 gig hard drive that you will need to upgrade to at least a terabyte hardrive, which takes a lot of time and money. Otherwise I am happy with the laptop.",0
"(Comfy but makes noise): Comfortable to work on and love having the # keys attached. However, not fond of the sound when processing and is a slower than I would like on load time.",0
"(Overall great gaming computer): I waited a few weeks after buying this before giving it a review. Overall this is a great computer. Keyboard has a good feel, screen is gorgeous and the very narrow bezel make it seem to fill the entire lid. It makes some unexpected noises on startup, but once its running it is as clear a sound as any I've used.Video is clear and it definitely can handle all the games I play without excessive heatup.Only complaint I have is the odd camera position, it's Under the monitor and off-center. The viewer on the far side of skype call is looking over the number pad keys. But that's a pretty minor issue.",0
"(not bad): so far this laptop has been awesome, battery life could be better though but its still pretty decent. now this is a chromebook so itś features are limited, you won't be able to play fortnite with it if that's what you're looking for. itś got the usb type c charging cord and it has one on both sides, very convenient. can complain about the touchscreen or the fact that it rotates 360 degrees. its perfect for students or even for the kids to mess around on.",0
"(Barely Functioning): I wanted a cheap semi-reliable laptop and this piece of crap died the second day. The wifi randomly decided to stop functioning, the power shuts off at random intervals without the battery life actually going down, and as a whole it’s probably just not worth the trouble. I wouldn’t buy this laptop if I were you.",0
(Laptop): This laptop keeps rebooting occasionally.i dont no whyit keeps doing that.Can anyone help me. Its really annoying,0
"(COMPUTADORA MUY BUENA EN RELACION PRECIO-CALIDAD): LA COMPUTADORA LLEGO UN DIA ANTES DE LO PREVISTO, FACIL DE CONFIGURAR AL IDIOMA ESPA?OL. ES RAPIDA PARA EJECUTAR SOFTWARE DE OFIMATICA Y TRABAJOS EN CASA. SE CALIENTA UN POCO, PERO CON UNA BASE ENFRIADORA, TODO BIEN.",0
(Bad): Its bad,0
"(Worst Operating System Software Ever!!!! Great hardware though...): The Hardware is great, but the chrome software is horrible. Thought this might be a good fit for any kind of work on the go, but if you learned on a mac or windows based software, then good luck learning how the new chrome software functions (it doesn't!). And they make it next to impossible to use any other program/app/service other than their own awful services, like the hoops you need to go through to add dropbox or any other cloud service that isn't googles service. Totally disregarding the users intentions and needs to promote their own service. No Thanks. This just became an expensive Video streamer!",0
(excelent): good,0
"(Great computer overall, no downsides): This computer has been excellent. It is very powerful and performs phenomenally for a wide variety of applications, ranging from gaming to school to work. Battery life is the only aspect that can be considered a slight downside, however, by dimming the screen brightness and turning off the keyboard, the battery life can be extended to several hours. The estimated battery life can go as high as 8-9 hours by setting the computer to power-saving mode through the Control Center 3.0 software that comes with it. Another good feature of this laptop is the fact that it has a numpad, as many smaller laptops lack. Overall, this computer was and still is an excellent purchase. Do not hesitate to buy it.",0
The display is very good.,0
"(Great laptop): Arrived on time, no problems.I SEVERELY dislike the 'Cortana' app and cannot uninstall it.Besides that, the laptop is just fine.",0
"(Thought I would hate it but fell in love): For background, I consider myself a power user when it comes to computers. I do a lot of 3-D CAD and CAM, a little bit of gaming (driving sims) and I can write a bit of code when I need to. I thought these Chromebooks were silly when they came out because they can't do all that other stuff I do on my PC. But I found for what I do most of my free time on the computer, recreation web browsing and video watching, this is an amazing machine.I received one of these as a gift a couple years ago and was so happy with it I purchased another one for my mother this christmas. It's not a Chromebook you're going to load Linux on and do some serious hacking, but for just browsing the web and watching video, e-mail, Docs, etc, you can't really beat this thing. It boots in seconds, has no problem with keeping a bunch of tabs open, plays video just fine. Not to mention it's durable as heck, I work in a machine shop at a materials testing company so there's all kinds of nasty materials and vapors floating around and computers do not live long. But the fanless design is really great and I haven't had any issues taking mine to work and using it for reference or whatever.Only complaint is the power button is kind of funky, I'm not really sure how it's supposed to work after using it every day for a year or two. Whenever I have to turn it on after a dead battery or something I have to do a dance of pressing and holding the button and eventually it decides to turn on. Another positive though is the battery is excellent. After letting it die a couple times a month, leaving it on AC for months on end, and using it all the time the battery life still hasn't degraded noticibly and it charges very quickly.Great product for the person who doesn't want to do anything too heavy, blows a full laptop out of the water for browsing.",0
"(Perfect for our teen): Want a laptop that has full connectivity, speed, and works very well for schoolwork? Choose this one. As more teachers move to document sharing it makes sense to have something like this for your teen to use. The overall durability is a bit suspect but with the price tag, it is essentially a 1-2 year investment for school. Chromebooks are extremely light, easy to type on and come with complete integration into Google cloud services like drive, docs and spreadsheets. You will not be gaming hard on this laptop or installing anything locally if you can help it because it's best served as a cloud only device. If your looking for windows, gaming (instead of app games like your phone) and local storage I would look elsewhere.Make sure to get the versions with at least 4gb of ram, it does make a difference for multi-tasking.",0
"(Great laptop): If your looking for a midpriced machine that performs way above expectations, look no further. This laptop is fantastic. Its fast, and powerful. The battery life is about average for today's laptops. The graphics are great. the only problem I have with this system is the heat. while unplugged its fine but as soon as you plug it in, the fan kicks on and it gets really hot. the fan pushes most of the heat out through the vents but the keyboard really heats up. if you can handle this minor annoyance, then you have yourself a fantastic laptop.",0
(Great): I dont use it for gaming but for editing youtube videos and it works great,0
"(It dos not have a backlit illuminated as it says in the description.): it does not have a backlit keyboard as it says in the description, the rest good enough for the price",0
"(Steer Clear If You Need a Laptop That Won't Crack): I had this laptop for not even 6 months before it cracked. I didn't drop it, didn't slam it or anything. I put it in book bag and took it out and the screen would not turn on. It was admittedly a fragile laptop to begin with and I was worried when I first held it. But now my concerns were confirmed. It was a hairline Crack under the screen and the laptop works perfectly except now it won't display anything. Samsung makes it really hard to even try to repair it, in fact they don't do it themselves. They also don't carry much value and to trade up they only offer 150 dollars towards the next laptop. Not worth the time or money for something that's ridiculously hard to repair and also ridiculously fragile.",0
(Impressive.): Everything I expected and more.,0
(Rating 9.2 out of 10): My MacBook M2 chip Midnight was the best laptop I could ever have. This was my first MacBook don’t expect the MacBook to have a touch screen or bar because it doesn’t if you do videos or editing this is a great laptop Thank you.,0
(Five Stars): Great computer! HP doesn’t disappoint!,0
"(Love it! One of the best gaming laptops!): It is my daily driver, despite not being the top tier best of the best of gaming laptops... It is still a beast for gaming. The price (at the time) was an amazing deal! Love it.",0
(Nice lightweight lap top.): Excellent school laptop.,0
"(Amazing Value): For a Chromebook, this is amazing. Super thin, tiny bezels, fast startup. It’s really fast. You can tell it’s having trouble when you have 6 different windows with 10 different tabs on each. But for moderate everyday function, it’s great for a sub-$200 school laptop.",0
(It simply will NOT boot.): It will NOT boot up. I bought insurance from Amazon.. For crying out loud. I think it is hopeless.,0
(My second HP Pavilion): This came with all the features I wanted and I love the backlit keyboard. My last HP Pavilion still works after 10 years and only one minor repair about 5 years ago. I couldn't update to Windows 10 so I was forced to buy a new one. I loved the large screen and full keyboard with ten key and didn't want to downsize. I have a tablet for other uses with a touch screen. I don't need a touch screen on a laptop.,0
"(Great battery and very fast): This great little computer has all the benefits of an incredible Chromebook (speed, easy to use, short boot time, fantastic battery life) without all the extra money going toward gimmicky features. This is perfect for someone browsing the web, making documents / presentations / spreadsheets / etc. You probably will love this Chromebook unless you are doing some heavy data modeling.",0
"(Excelente, Económica y de Calidad): Es ideal para la universidad, a mi hija le encantó, además se le puede optimizar la memoria Ram y el disco duro (se recomienda que expire la garantía para optimizarla)Lo malo es que NO tiene teclado retroalimentado, esta equivocada esa opción presentada en la propaganda.",0
(Not working out of the box. Used?): Not working as turned on. Returned for refund. Shipping was not refunded. Not happy !!,0
"(Great budget Laptop): I have zero room for a gaming desktop, so I wanted a laptop. The issue was I needed a budget friendly one that would be worth the money. This one fit the bill perfectly! I got monthly payment options and when I got the laptop it booted up so fast. The screen helps against glare, the refresh rate is fast, and it handles my games smoothly. I edit videos on it and make my animations. It's render time isn't bad and the programs don't slow it. This laptop is noisey - very noisy and the battery life is non-existent. I have to keep it plugged in, but honestly it's a laptop that's running battery consuming programs, so it's expected and not a huge hassle. This is my first good laptop and I regret nothing.",0
(Super fast delivery from US to Japan and no damage to the laptop.): The delivery was very quick without any damage to the laptop. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. Smooth interface and no lags. cheers to Amazon.,0
"(Amazing great inexpensive Chromebook!): Amazing great inexpensive Chromebook! I purchased this for my in-laws that are not at all techies to replace a dog slow old Dell laptop, and they absolutely love it! I am very impressed with the quality of it and the performance for basic functions such as email, web surfing, YouTube videos etc. Setup was a breeze! ChromeOS found the local USB printer and got it working right away automatically. The build quality is solid for a basic 15.6 inch laptop. The battery life is great (12 hours). The screen quality is perfectly good as well. Nice snappy little laptop!",0
"(Not worth the money I spent): Can't see video on my directv app, can't use my cbs all access or netlix. Games are ok. I should have just bought a tablet. Would have been happier",0
"(Great Gaming Laptop): Great laptop for gaming at friends houses. I can run Halo Infinite 45-50 fps with all graphics settings on high. You will need to have its power plugged in while playing taxing games like halo or call of duty, because this beast will end its battery life.",0
"(Can't even consistently play 720p video): I didn't think it would be asking too much to be able to consistently play 720p video from youtube, twitch, espn or disney+, but this laptop often can't get through these videos without freezing and stuttering due to hardware issues.",0
"(Left speaker isn't working!): Received the laptop this afternoon. Tested it and noticed that the left speaker isn't working. Asus support advised me to reinstall the driver and it still won't work. Asked me to reset the PC and still, left speaker won't work. Can you please advise how to get a replacement? I will leave the US on Nov 30.",0
"(Do not buy this!): I have had excellent luck with other Asus products but this one is a thorn in my side! It flat out doesn't work, I've had to reset it several times since I purchased it in January. Finally just gave up and spent the extra money for a good HP with a hard drive. In fact, I am attempting to factory reset this piece of crap and hope someone will buy it resale. By the way, I have never ever written such a negative review on any other consumer product. I used to rave over Asus products, maybe I just got a lemon but this machine is a total headache!!!!",0
(ONLY WIFi. Cannot be hard wired): Most disappointed in Asus. Some people like to have R 45. Option. No R45 Jack.Volume is soft.,0
"(First gaming laptop): This is my first gaming laptop and I did my research on what I should get. Obviously this was my choice, but I'm not disappointed in the least. The look, feel, speed, and overall features this laptop has blew me away. Definitely recommend this laptop to anyone who is getting into gaming or just needs a high performance laptop.",0
(Problem computer): Much lower than an optimal gaming laptop in my opinion. I had nothing but issues with this from the moment I got it. Returned after two weeks. Bought a different machine and it worked perfectly out of the box. Definitely spend the extra money for something more reliable.,0
"(Awful): Battery doesn’t charge when I’m using the laptop so it’s essentially useless considering it has about an hour worth of battery before dying. Look at reviews on other sites, the battery is a huge issue with this model/brand. I could have bought a regular laptop for 600 and not have ran into these issues.",0
(It’s an Apple): It’s an Apple. That really says it all.,0
"The keyboard comes with customizable backlighting and macros, letting you tailor your typing experience to your preferences and needs, in line with the 2018 standard for keyboards.",1
"(Doesn't come equipped as advertised!): Advertised to come with Windows 11. Comes with Windows 10. No response from seller. It's a decent laptop. Gets hot quickly and is noisy when trying to run video programs. Substantially slower with an ethernet cable ironically than with wifi. Not really what I paid for. I'll sell upgrade and not use this supplier again. It's very slow and takes a very long time to do some simple tasks for being ""brand new"" speaker quality is TERRIBLE. It crashes way more than I'd like. The supplier was not 100% honeat about this particular laptop.",0
(Awesome Laptop): My brother love his new laptop 👍🏼,0
(I want it replaced ASAP): Keyboard does not work,0
"(Don’t buy!!!): Have to reboot because the shift key doesn’t work, have to reset your modem every time you turn it on to get wifi. Eventually it stopped connecting to wifi all together 1 one passed the return date. Piece of junk",0
(Get the upgraded version): The chrome book is very basic. Can not play simple kids games like Roblox etc,0
"(ABSOLUTE JUNK): FURIOUS. Bought for elderly mother in April '21 but didn't activate until Sept '21 due to her hospitalization. In March '22, the machine started acting up (would turn off suddenly) until later that month the Chrome OS crashed. Contacted Lenovo's ""awesome"" customer service and they dumped it off onto Google (I get that it's a software issue), which only has web support (i.e., no human beings). Followed prompts to reinstall Chrome OS via online support but all it gave me was a black screen. Consulted online forums and tried their suggestions to no avail. Of course, since it's out of warranty (even though it was only used maybe two dozen times for about an hour each), the Chromebook is a black-screen paperweight. Several computer repair shops offered to fix for more than the machine is worth. Never again. Lenovo lost my business FOREVER. Could have saved me as a customer if they offered even the tiniest of support.",0
(Excellent perfomance): I was a little scared but its a good computer for working. The light a vack can be shut down with fn+L and the webcam doesnt annoy that much.,0
"The only downside is the metal for the keyboard it's kinda clunky and cheap, I feel sometimes will break",0
(Great product): Really a great value for just 1000$ It has been shipped to Egypt no damage happen and really great quality,0
(Nice little machine.): Arrived a day early. Setup was quick and easy. Attached a soundbar and we be jammin'.,0
(Touch screen stopped working after a windows update.): After a windows update the touch screen stopped working. The seller directed me to the manufacturer to look for a fix. The manufacturer gave me 5 possible solutions but none have worked. Turns out this is a common issue with this laptop.,0
(Great quality great price fine product): Easy set up everything that I needed really pleased,0
"(Excelente laptop): Hermosa laptop, la utilizo para photoshop, after effects, premier pro e illustrator. Super veloz con el SSD M.2, el unico extra que hice fue agregarle 8 mas de ram.

"(I was told “if ya love your IPhone and IPad, you need the MacBook”.): Beautiful, thin, light, state of the art M2 chip midnight MacBook is one of my best purchases ever. My son wanted one for college and I told him I could get him an Intel based laptop with the same power for much less money. He got a MacBook and he was right. Forward thinking. I was afraid of the jump from intel to something I wasn’t familiar with. 15 minute set up and it took all of my contacts, news, emails, bookmarks and pictures from my IPhone 10 X Max over WiFi. Added an 8-1 hub, a mouse and Microsoft Office Home and Business 2021 lifetime license ($35) for less than $100. Love this thing and won’t look back. Not a techie nor early adopter. People claim they’re good for 10 years. Take a leap!",0
(Learn from home): Can't get touch screen to work....other then that works fine .Back to school for grandson,0
(Would not recommend!): Disappointed with the screen quality. The picture is the quality of an 80’s tv and there is such a huge glare that it’s hard to use during the day. Would never purchase again!,0
(Fan broken): Arrived with broken fan and arrived late,0
(Excellent machine.): This machine is well worth the money. All new systems need to update as features and securities have evolved since the software was loaded. How quickly this is done depends entirely on your internet connection speed. I am very happy I bought this laptop and highly recommend it.,0
(SSD FAILED !!!!! BAD QUALITY): SSD failed about 4 months into using this item. cannot return or replace. money down the toilet.,0
"(2018 New HP Chromebook 11.6 Model # 11-v025wm is not compatible with Google Play Store app): Be aware that this Chromebook Model # 11-v025wm (linked below) is not compatible with the Google Play Store app. While you are able to access the Play Store from the internet, you cannot download applications to the Chromebook. This was confirmed by first attempting to download applications and then speaking with HP technical support.If using Google Play Store is not a factor for you, the laptop may be okay for general internet use and to access programs on the internet.If it is an issue, the HP tech cited these two consumer HP Chromebook Model #s as being compatible with Google Play Store - 1) HP X360-11 and 2) HP X2-12. I don't know if these are bonafide models, but am passing these details along.The tech also cited the HP Chromebook HP 11G5 as a commercially available model and could not confirm its compatibility with Play Store. However, I'd previously purchased one and it was compatible, but I had to send it back because the touchpad was not consistently working.Overall, if compatibility matters to you, I would suggest doing your own research to make sure the laptop has the features you desire. Looking at the official Google Chromebooks blog for updated listings of Chromebooks compatible with Google Play Store may help.Chromebook not compatible with Google Play Store from my experience:",0
(Great buy): Great laptop for the money,0
(HDD is only 475 GB and not 512!): The description says that the laptop is 512 GB. Mine has only 475 GB.I payed lot of money for this machine and it’s quite disappointing that you don't get what they advertise.,0
"(Powerfull and cheap): Great for proce, feel really durable and premium",0

(... only had this for a couple days but I love it. I went from a macbook to this ...): I have only had this for a couple days but I love it. I went from a macbook to this and expected to be disappointed. I didn't have to adjust any of the settings or anything with this laptop. I logged into my gmail and everything was perfect. So far I have no complaints. I can't believe how inexpensive it was.,0
(Bigger and long battery life!): The long battery life and fast!,0
(Deficient battery): The computer is generally as advertised. Some of the keys do not work very well and the battery is terrible. This one will not hold an hour of use. I could understand half the life but 1/8th seems like they didn’t check it.,0
"(Might be okay if you aren't an old school typist.): It's cheap and fast enough for basic internet crap. It is really, really, really horrible if you learned how to type years ago on a normal keyboard. Every time you try to type the letter A, you get a google search box because everything on the keyboard is off center. There are no home, end, delete or cap lock keys. Every time I use this machine, I want to throw it out the window or hang myself. Spend the money and buy a Windows machine....",0
"(Love This Laptop): I really love everything about this laptop. The processor is fast, which was the main reason I chose it. The graphics are beautiful, finger print reader is functional, I like how it flips, and it's so light to travel with. I totally recommend this product.",0
(Needed more features.): This wasn't what I needed so I returned it. It arrived quickly. No complaints about the service I just needed more features.,0
(Doesn’t turn/stay on unless plugged in.): The battery stays at 0% and it doesn’t stay on unless plugged in. Returning it.,0
Very nice little laptop for a very good price.,0
"(Completed hardware tests on unpacking): I will be updating this review as I use it, but I wanted to give my first impressions.First off, after unboxing and updating, I ran all the standard hardware tests (dead pixel check, keyboard check, cpu/gpu stress tests) and found no issues. That was nice since I was concerned about ordering online with UPS guys tossing it around.For a gaming laptop, it's not super heavy, though it feels more solid than most laptops I've worked on. The low bezel screen looks gorgeous and feels solid. Opening from a corner doesn't feel like I'm torquing it much at all, and it rests easily where I leave it. The trackpad may not feel as luxuriously anti-friction as a Dell XPS, but neither have I complaints. I will say the keys feel much nicer than my old Toshiba. Not surprising as it was half the price.One thing which is nice but unnecessary is the sound. Gamers are likely to use headphones anyway, but I was impressed by the volume. I actually had to shut it down overnight instead of leaving it to run all its updates and restarts because it makes what my gf calls a ""Fruit Ninja"" sound effect when booting up. I find it satisfying, but I'll probably need to silence it from the bios eventually.Speaking of sound, this *is* a gaming laptop, so if you want something to quietly take notes in class... Maybe don't? It's not horrible, but the fans are quite noticeable when it's not idling. This should go without saying, but for the love of Azathoth do not block the vents with a blanket. It's bad form to strangle such a nice computer.It came with a code to get Just Cause 4, so I plan to try that out in the next week and update my review with how it actually performs in game. I started out playing Pokemon Uranium while other things downloaded and I may ironically get sucked into a graphically minimal game first. God I hope the next real Pokemon is more like this... What was I taking about? Oh yeah. For now I'll just say that running FurMark stress test on 1920x1080 res and UHD settings it stabilized at 68 degrees and >80fps.Overall, I think this thing is gorgeous, feels premium, and appears to have solid specs. For reference, I have the 17"" w/ RTX 2060 (6GB), NVMe SSD, and 1x16GB RAM. If you want more storage, I recommend going with that model and filling out the spare bay with a 2TB FireCudda SSHD for $80 rather than upping the price much more for less storage.",0
"(runs a little slow): so far so good , like the color but is a little slow.",0
(Mal empacado..): Muy buen equipo en relación a lo que pagas.. Pero.. lo enviaron muy mal empacado.. ni siquiera se tomaron la molestia de colocar bolsas de aire para evitarle golpes.. la caja nos llego golpeada y eso preocupa tomando en cuenta lo delicado que puede ser..,0
"Product seems very sturdy, and the display is excellent.",0
"Battery life is excellent IF AND ONLY IF you change Power Mode to ""Battery saver"".",0
"(I love having new stuff): I'm an Asus fanboy all the way; the only thing to comment on is a mismatch in the product description.I bought it because somewhere in the description said this was a 1440p display and yes I should have known better, but it was still lame that the amazon description says 1440p in some places and 1080p in others.15.6 1080p is more than sufficient for the games I play on the road. Whenever I'm not on mobile gaming I'm on my 1440p ultrawide monitor, so no big deal.",0
"(Absolute price/performance/quality phenomenon): TL;DR: greatest qualities of this laptop: CPU, GPU, cooling solution, 144 Hz 5 ms response time display, keyboard, I/O ports placement, upgrade options. I.e. everything, LOL :DI was looking to build a mini-ITX desktop PC, and was targeting around 1500$ with monitor and peripherals. Then I suddenly came across the Ryzen chips and their shocking performance advantage w.r.t Intel mobile chips. This Legion 5 with a 45W Ryzen 7 4800H and an 80W 1660 Ti is an absolute beast of performance-per-watt metric.1) 4800H scores 4500 points in Cinebench R20 multi-thread. Just for reference, desktop Ryzen 7 3700X does 4800 Intel i7-10700K does 5300. For a mobile chip this is phenomenal.2) Lenovo did great job with cooling! Other laptops with 4800H have slightly lower score in sustained load. HP Omen and especially ASUS TUF laptop with their awful blocked air vents.3) 1660 Ti is full 80W, that means it is not restricted in performance. Moreover, it has a headroom for overclocking, I got +150 MHz on core, + 1000 MHz on memory with GPU max load temperature around 78 degC.4) The display is gorgeous. 144 Hz, 5 ms response time (with (!) Overdrive in Lenovo Vantage). It is just perplexing how this laptop in this price category includes such a jewel of a display.5) Keyboard is very nice too. I am comparing to Lenovo Ideapad 720S-15IKB laptop which has flat and shallow keys. Legion 5 in contrast has curved keys with much larger travel. Feels really great in long typing sessions.6) Upgrades, upgrades, upgrades. There are upgrades for: storage (NVMe + SSD or 2 x NVMe), RAM (up to 64 GB), Wi-Fi and even battery! This Legion 5 version has 60 Wh battery which allows to install secondary SSD. However you can order and install an 80 Wh battery which usually comes in Legion 7i. Secondary NVMe can be installed in any case, but it blocks the SSD upgrade.7) Ports! There are 4 x USB Type A, 1 x USB Type-C, HDMI and LAN. Such plenty of choice satisfies all laptop needs. Moreover, only 2 USB ports are on the sides, whereas everything else including charging port are on the rear side. It makes so much difference in cable management and access, such a great port placement decision!8) Finally, this laptop is more on the traditional side. It has webcam, it is on the top of the screen, numpad is present and has standard layout, Home/End/PgUp/PgDn buttons are primary and full-size, arrow keys are full-size in usual T-shape. Such a pleasure to use this laptop!9) Accessories. I purchased a TomToc laptop sleeve (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DLBJ4QD) which fits really nice! Also I got the Razer Gigantus V2 mouse pad Medium, which fits great in the sleeve.Thank you Lenovo!",0

"(Extremely great hardware but bad design choices): Pros: - Really great hardware, 3080 16GB etc- Good price- Has NVME 4.0 and NMVE 3.0 support (1 port each)- Great for gaming- IPs screen looks great- Speakers good- Full size keyboard, wanted to get an ROG ,but skipped on it because of the lack of a keyboardCons: - Bad design- Camera position at the bottom, will show fingers while typing. Should have moved it to the top or removed it and reduce the price.- Power cable on right, should be on left and farthest from user, since most people are right-handed (mouse on right).. looks cleaner- 3.5mm port is in between ethernet cable and USB ports, should be on the last port on the left, nearest to users, not between other ports- Fans can get really loud, but good thing temps stay cool- Keyboard RGB software, (Fusion) always resets to default wave on startup, no fix yet- Aourus software is a bit clunky, hopefully aorus should update, with better UI and UXOverall Review: - For the price, I would definitely recommend it, Wanted to give 4.5 stars ..but its well priced and gets 5 stars- Hopefully, Aourus takes notes and makes future laptops better.",0
"(Volume issues): I would be happy with this unit if the volume worked all of the time but I constantly have to restart it because the volume quits working. The first time it happened was right after the return window closed. I researched the issue and found out I have to do a factory reset. I did that the first three times and then tried just restarting and that works for awhile. This happens about once or twice/ week and is a real pain. If I had to do it over again, I would not purchase a Samsung Chromebook.",0
(Great gaming laptop.): This is my first gaming laptop and I love it! The screen quality is crazy clear 1080p. It’s perfect for gaming and it’s fast no lagging at all or any sign of slowing down. The battery life is standard. It’s fast powering up as well! This is by the most greatest gaming computer I bought.,0

"(Dissappointed): I bought this to replace my current i3 Dell, which is 6 years old. It has slowed down considerably, and it constantly loses its wifi connection. At first, about a year ago, it would happen once or twice a week, but now it happens every few minutes. NOT my wifi. All other devices work fine. I did download and install updated drivers about a month ago, and it only made it worse. I need reliable WIFI for my job, to attend Zoom and Teams meetings. Out of the box, I was impressed with this model's speed and connectivity. But, I took it to work to show it off and when I got it home, it would not connect again. It was like its ability to connect to wifi just vanished. It's only a week old. I'm returning this and going back to Dell.",0

"(My laptop review): I like the business look I like that it look professional. Its my first game and video editing laptop. The laptop is fast already and I overkill it by boasting the memory ram to 32g. I open 4 program and run it and this thing was fast no glitch. I like the ability to monitor the cpu, ram, and storage plus much more with lenevo program. The fan are pretty quiet when surfing the internet and watching YouTube. When gaming you can here the fan but its not loud at all i was impress. What I dislike so far is the battery life at 85% I can only run my game about an hour and the battery will be dead. Its okay though I knew the battery was a lower model and I expected it to last a short time.",0

"(Muy buenas especificaciones): El producto llegó en excelente estado y más rápido de lo esperado. Las especificaciones son tal cuál se oferta. Me gustó el producto. Los materiales son buenos de acuerdo al precio. Solo tiene un detalle con las bisagras al abrir la laptop y es que se escucha un peque?o chasquido pero nada exageradamente grave solo hay que levantarlo con cuidado. El teclado es suave al tacto, tiene unas membranas muy suaves con el tiempo se degrada, le calculo unos 3 a?os de vida con un uso diario por periodos de tiempo largos (Ya he tenido uno similar y algunas teclas se volvieron un poco duras). La ssd que trae integrada es de una marca extra?a que no conocía, espero que sea de alto rendimiento y aguante.",0
"(Do not buy): Initially, the laptop was fine to use. I bought it to use for college and it was a decent laptop. After a few months, I started to notice that parts inside the laptop seemed loose. Every time I moved it, objects inside the laptop would also rattle. The fingerprint id does not work. The trackpad also freezes a lot. My main problem with this is the fan that goes off VERY loudly at random times (it’s pretty awkward and embarrassing when it does go off in class or the library). There was about a 3 month period where it did not go off but it started once again. I’ve been using this for almost three years. If you are considering buying this, don’t.",0
"(Great service): I like how what I saw online it was exactly what I wanted, the battery is and it's spead is quiet very good",0
"(An actual gaming laptop.): Run all games smooth butter, fans a bit loud but I think is necessary for the GPU card. I liked the bottom design, seems to have great cooling system. Speakers are bad, but once you add Nahemic drivers it gets better. Screen is awesome at 144hz. So far, very satisfied that it works for gaming. I tried others with RTX 1660 Ti and just couldn't run playable games, by far this is the best value you can get.",0
Charging is amazingly fast. It took less than an hour to get to 100% from when it arrived.,0
"(Not as advertised 1366x768): Screen resolution is 1366x768, not the advertised 1920x1080Battery seems sketchy too",0
"(It's basically a gaming-focused thinkpad!!!): I love thinkpads. Durable. Portable. Powerful. Upgradable... or, at least they USED to be.I'll keep it brief: if you miss the understated, over-engineered (in a good way), user serviceable thinkpads of the past (before they started soldering in the ram, using low power U-series chipsets, and whatnot), if you do any color critical work, if you are a closet gamer, or a video editor on the go, BUY THIS LAPTOP.Its build is reminiscent of the W540 (to my eye, at least), with the 15.6"" display (bright and color accurate), offset keyboard and trackpad, narrow numpad, and dropped arrow keys, it seems the only things missing is a trackpoint nub and the W540s lackluster performanceIt is thoughtfully engineered, in that, its design elements are not based on fads or flash... the engineers seemed to be focused on an internal layout that prioritizes thermals, which in turn allows you to get the best possible performance, and basically every choice feels deliberate and justified, instead of pandering to fickle market trends. the designers showed and incredible amount of restraint, and i commend them for it.I bought this for use with Davinci Resolve (4k editing and color grading), Adobe Lightroom, Pro Tools, Ableton Live, light coding, and light gaming. I use this for work primarily, but it's nice to know that when i have time and the inclination, i can game on this without having to consult canirunit.com.I highly, HIGHLY recommend this laptop. It is my opinion that this laptop, in this configuration, has the best price to performance ratio of any other ""gaming"" laptop in 2020.It is a gaming Thinkpad.",0
"(Perfect for My Needs!): I am not a gamer, but this laptop works perfectly for my needs. I mainly use the Microsoft Suite and video conferencing apps (WebEx, Microsoft Teams, Zoom) and have absolutely zero problems. Also really like the fingerprint reader and the USB-C port...all great features! Would definitely recommend.",0
(If you want something that lasts practically forever buy it): Price point for an apple laptop good. Screen is great so are the speakers. Dead easy to set up. I had my last one for 13 years hope this is the same. Only negative. The new usb-c ( lightning ) does not support the apple super drive. You have to buy an adapter.,0
"(Got for family friend to replace 7 yr old laptop): Ordered this to replace a 7 yr old Windows 7 laptop that was at it's upgrade limit. The family friend that uses this laptop lives in the country where internet is almost non existent. Needed something that could run for a relatively long time on battery, but was still easy to use. Windows 11 image used allowed setup without a Microsoft account which was helpful for the aforementioned lack of internet. Had to adjust the settings to move the start button to the old location and had to do some training on the differences when coming from Windows 7. Overall a nice laptop with a nice track pad and screen as well as battery life. Was nice enough that I am considering ordering another one for myself.",0

"(Slow!): Slowest computer I have ever had. Only purchased to use adobe and editing software as I have a chromebook that does everything else but does not support adobe software. I have had HP in the past and hoped for a better experience since the last time I purchased an HP was in 2011 for college, however…. All other features are fine. Just, very slow loading ???",0
(Gaming laptop with main Ports in back big plus): Almost perfect for $1000 laptop. 8 cores cpu 16gb ram can upgrade to 32gb. 1660ti gpu handles most games on high settings. 512gb m.2 storage with extra m.2 slot. Main ports in rear makes laptop looks clean on desk 144hz screen great for csgo and call of duty. Great gaming specs.Cons: fans make a little noise in heavy gaming not too bad.

"(Where's the CAPS LOCK?): The only thing I don't like about my new Acer Chromebook is that it doesn't have a CAPS LOCK key. I keep hitting the key that is CAPS LOCK on other laptops and computers and it takes me to the menu. Very frustrating when I'm in the middle of writing and I need to write a long word or phrase in all capital letters. Other than that, it is a great laptop and I enjoy it very much.",0
(Perfect!): Owned the previous version but spilled water on it. Replaced with this model. Touch screen very responsive. Easy operation!,0
(Great speeds and overall laptop): You definitely can’t game on this but so far it’s a good device. Good speeds just wish there was more storage even if it cost $10-20 more. My only concerns are the touchpad is very hard so long term durability is a concern.,0
"(DOA): DOA. did not turn on.UPDATE: they sent me a new one, I've been using it flawlessly for about a year and a half. It's been great.",0

(Thumbs down for online meeting that require use of camera.): When using the camera for Microsoft Teams the image is grainy and unacceptable for doing meeting online.I have been unable to adjust so I might need to spend anther $100-$150 on an HD camera now. Nice little machine but not useable when working from home.,0
(Muy buena): Excelente calidad buen rendimiento,0

(Good especially for night time): Light keyboard make better job,0
"(Screenpad 2.0 not ready for prime time): The Screenpad 2.0 is more hassle than it's worth. I thought it'd make a great calculator (in place of a larger keyboards physical number pad) but I can't get various calculators sized right to make them useful or the calculator buttons are way to small. And just overall there is just a wonkiness to the Screenpad making it more cumbersome. I like the size of the screen, the weight, and build quality seem good, but I'll need to go back to a 2-1 or touchscreen laptop.",0

Then I was going to boot into a Linux live ISO to see if it was a Windows 11 problem but after booting into the BIOS to disable secure boot, the laptop hung in the BIOS as well.

"(2018 HP 14 Chromebook 14 HD Touchscreen): I purchased this chromebook last year. It seems to be very effective do school work, send emails, watch videos. Hopefully I be able to bring this Chromebook with me to University next year. I am very pleased with this product. I had to paid custom fees which was a surprise and it wasn't a lot. Just contact the seller and they will happily refund. I love the ability to access all of the google apps so easily.I love the ability to access all of the google apps so easily and being able to use the google play store to download other apps the same way on my smart phone. when using the android apps I notice that they respond better to touchscreen than using the actual mouse.I like the touchscreen feature and the battery life on the device so far seems amazing.The webcam on this chromebook is not the best out there. It's a typical laptop webcam. It would be fine for skype, FaceBook calls.This is a Chromebook and not Windows os so technically you will have to get use doing things a bit differently. If you press just the search key alone by accident, it brings up this pop up from the bottom of the screen that you can search google directly from, however, it can become annoying when you are just starting off with typing, for some people that may not be the case.This is a great computer for light, everyday use and I think it was well worth its price.

"(Perfect for the price.): The laptop did not come in the original packaging and was missing some attachments as I have seen in product reviews, but that is fine. I purchased the unit used for under $800, so I figured the laptop was an open box. No scratches or dents in perfect working condition, so I got a steal. The only downside is, the laptop is for my son, however since it’s used I was not able to add insurance. I can hold my own when it comes to PC/laptop repairs so not a deal breaker. I did notice that upon setup, I had to plug the laptop into an Ethernet for setup. WI-FI was a greyed-out option until Windows 11 booted, then I was able to disable airplane mode.

"(Plastic beveling peeling off): Within a month, the plastic beveling around the screen started to peel off/unattach. I called ASUS support who are the absolute worst. Albeit, all computer customer services are terrible except for Apple. ASUS wanted me to ship back my laptop, at my expense, and wait 4 weeks to get it back. No thanks. Fortunately amazon is letting me return this. Way too dangerous to keep this laptop for the long term and see what other issues arise. Wirecutter needs to update their reviews and remove this cheaply made laptop. Go for Dell XPS 13 insteadBUYER BEWARE",0
"(Good value): I've had it for a week with very light use, but it works well. It boots up in seconds, backlit keyboard works (had to turn on with a function key), and I haven't noticed anything with the mouse. I do wish the power button wasn't a keyboard key, and I wish the buttons on the touchpad were actual buttons. But the laptop works well. I have used it for shopping, google sheets, basic use so far. Will update if I run into any problems.",0
"((Detailed Review) TEMP FIX/BEST LAPTOP!): Okay, so I was hesitant on this laptop because some of the reviews mentioned bad temperatures. I was concerned with getting a laptop with bad thermal paste (which does happen). However, the laptop came super well! Lots of reviewers fail to mention the healthy temperature levels. Idle should be 30-45c. And under full load it should never go past 85c. EVER!!! If it goes past, it's likely it could either be, 1: Bad Thermal Paste/application, 2: Bad Fans, 3:Lack of contact with HeatSinks. 4: Bad Ventilation. If buying new, and the temps aren't matching, exchange it, as shipping can sometimes damage components. Laptops generally require maintenance. If heavy using, 1-2 Years. Make sure those temps never go past 85c. Over time you will have to replace the thermal paste or fans may give out. Grizzly Kryonaute is the best paste. Those are very very easy fixes. Just keep that in mind when buying ANY gaming laptop! If you are scared to tamper with it, buy some insurance and send it to acer. (Continuing with the review......) With poor ventilation I was reaching 85c. I bought a laptop cooler, the IETS with rubber rings. I'm getting incredible temperatures! Never going past 78c! This laptop is very heavy on proper Ventilation. If you look at the design there are a ton of vents from the bottom that push out through the top of the keyboard. S1I think a laptop cooler is necessary if you're gonna be gaming. This thing is incredible. I'm running games on High/Max settings (Elden Ring, warzone, apex) and getting awesome frames. I upgraded the ram to 32GB and this thing is a work horse. Dual rank 3200 32gb ram will increase your frames by about 15, and more opened tabs!! ;) I also installed a 2tb samsung ssd. (Which I highly recommend you do) It is much easier to install an nvme than the SATA one. So I would recommend getting a m.2 nvme. Opening the back piece for upgrades can be a challenge. There Is a trick to it, and it's likely you will break something if you don't get it right. So don't force it! So be very careful and gentle when doing it. Use a pick to slowly Pry it open. Pull from the vents back side. The battery can get kinda hot too. So make sure it's in a good spot. You can also set the battery charge level to 80% for longer battery lifespan. That's pretty much it! It's an amazing laptop for the price and power! Bang for your buck! Happy gaming!",0

"(Full HD 1080p/HW HEVC decoding (Intel Pentium Silver N5000)): I bought this laptop basically for its Full HD IPS panel at a cheap price! HP 14-df0010nr (Intel Pentium Silver N5000 Processor,UHD Graphics 605, 4 GB 2400MHz SDRAM, 128 GB SATA SSD). Windows 10 Home in S Mode (WIN 10 Home OEM key in BIOS). Fan-less cooling (Totally silent!)",0
(My new laptop): This is by far the best laptop I have ever had. I can do so much with it,0
(Great computer): Powerful fun computer. The battery doesn't last long but I think that's because the light thin case doesn't allow a large battery. Not a big deal,0
(Just what we needed!): Start up was fast. Everything is fast on this laptop. Buy this one! You won't regret it.,0
"(Motherboard Fried 3 Months Outside of Warranty): Initially, this laptop seemed to be a fair value for the price. Aside from trackpad issues and a poorly manufactured screen hinge, the laptop performed admirably.Unfortunately, two months out of warranty the screen started to flicker, and I no longer had any control over the brightness which made working in a well lit office a nightmare. One month later (3 months out warranty) the computer stopped turning on. A local repair shop determined the motherboard is no longer functional.Asus obviously refuses to offer any assistance at this point. I highly recommend spending your money elsewhere on a produce that will last longer than 15 months.",0
I Wish it came with upgrade options such as 1TB SSD and 32gb ram,0
(Dissatisfaction.): The laptop was delivered with a faulty ( power pack) Charger. I thought it was faulty and almost returned it.,0
(poor): constantly losing wifi connection don't like numeric keypad layout,0
"(Great!): Amazing computer for the money, and saved money by upgrading my own memory and HDD",0
Only negative is that speakers are on the bottom.,0
"(4 years in, still a great laptop): This laptop is great. Cheap but good quality, fast, good battery life. I've owned it for 4 years, I've dropped it a few times, still going strong. Does everything I need, good stuff.",0
"(Great laptop): Nothing I didn't like, this little laptop is perfect!",0
(Great School Computer): I bought this for my teenage daughter to use for high school. All in all this is a very good and affordable computer for school use. I was not too concerned about the 32G storage since I gave her an external hard drive to store her files on when it is not necessary to have them located on the computer's hard drive. I would certainly buy this again and probably will when the next kiddo reaches high school.,0
(Perfect.....): Perfect....,0
"(Straight Performance): Received this laptop about a week ago and I can't think of anything significant to gripe about. The display is sharp and the keyboard is surprisingly very comfortable. The fans are quiet enough to where I barely ever notice them, this isn't the case with other gaming laptops. I very much enjoy my marathon sessions in games like Hearts of Iron 4. And so I was very happy to see that the performance stayed strong, even into the late game, where HoI 4 can be notorious for majorly slowing down. This laptop doesn't make me miss my gaming desktops very much. Can't ask for much more than a well-rounded laptop that makes gaming, while traveling, feel like home.",0
(Four Stars): The keyboard doesnt light up and i dont like that,0
"(Great Laptop for Work and Fun): I’ve been very happy with this MacBook and it’s integration with my my iPhone, iPad and Mac accessories. It’s light weight but feels substantial with the aluminum frame and the keyboard is crisp and responsive for a compact laptop.",0
"(Wow, just Wow! Hands Down THE MOST bang for the buck!!!): I did a LOT of research for a new gaming rig. Normally, I build Desktops. but decided to look and se what Laptops had to offer. Now, I am no E-Sports gamer or anything, but I love for my games to run smoothly. I connect this thing to my Samsung Odessey G9 (5120x1440 native) and crank everything to max and go... Games run smooth, the fans aren't too loud and I would highly suggest a cooling pad to get just a bit more out of this thing.Oh, read the manual (especially about the ROG Keystone). Kinda cool.If you plan to be portable with this laptop and NOT game, then invest in a nice 100w USB-C Charger, will be a lot lighter and take less room than the brick this comes with. However, overall, this is a chonky beast and if you plan to carry this around a lot with your gaming gear, get a nice backpack, it will save you a lot of aches later on.",0
"(85w gpu is a huge plus for me): After buying I ran into money problems. The 85w gpu makes this guy super efficient for gpu mining. Yes not practical or scalable, but worked out for me. 50 mhs 85w for eth ~$60 a month :)",0

(Great Budget Gaming Laptop and for school!!!): Amazing all around laptop i got for $599. Able to do school work and play games when I need to. Runs everything smooth with gtx 1650. No overheating problems so far. This is good if you have a family and are trying to game at good settings for all current games and do other office tasks.,0
"(Overall happy with this (XPS 15/9500) so far!): I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this is a big ticket item for most people.I have nothing bad to say regarding the particular XPS 9500 unit I received with a couple of caveats...The Bad:Similar to other reviewers, I suspect this product is not ""NEW"" as described but rather returned and/or refurbished. It came in a rather torn up box which was simply sealed with regular packing tape. It was shipped to Amazon from a company that appears to be an authorized reseller/or refurbishing center as far as I could tell from a quick Google search. The box had certainly been around the block a time or two, LOL.Given the price point and specs, I'm not surprised if it is a ""refurb, open box, return, etc."" I'm only surprised that Amazon sells them at a steep discount but describes as ""NEW"". I could be way off base here, and perhaps Dell ships most of their products in beat up boxes, and I'm just unaware of it.The Good:I know the above sounded very critical, but bear with me. Once I opened the outer box, the inner Dell box was pristine. Everything was nicely packaged and appeared brand new. The usual protective plastic peel off, unwrap, etc. stuff was all there on everything. There wasn't a fingerprint or speck of dust to be found. Even smelled ""like new"". So...I figured I'd give it a go. Set it up and everything seemed fine, so I opened it up and upgraded memory to 64gb. Everything internally looked new to my untrained eye as well. I've been using it for several days with no issues. Overall, I personally am happy for the price, but if these aren't truly ""new"", I think description should reflect that.Considerations:My laptop before this one was an XPS 15 2012 or 2013 model. It originally had Windows 8 on it FWIW. I had upgraded to SSD, switched to Win10, maxed out RAM, and replaced battery over the years...Just so you know my basis for comparison.Other reviews on both Amazon and online mention crackling speakers and faulty trackpads with this model. My experience has been that speakers sound as good as any laptop I've ever heard, and trackpad is slightly less sensitive in top corners but otherwise fine (I never would have noticed trackpad thing except for online reviews had me looking for faults.) I personally find the speakers and trackpad perfectly fine. Another criticism has been loud fan noise when laptop is trying to cool. It doesn't bother me because my old XPS sounds like a turbo spooling up when it's under a load too! Maybe other brands are quieter, IDK. Fan noise wasn't a big concern of mine.Perhaps mine was a return/refurb that had faults addressed, I just got lucky and got a good unit, or the faults aren't as bad as they are made out to be with this model. I can't say for certain, but that's my experience thus far and honest review.",0
(Pretty good laptop): Very good laptop for gaming and general use. My only complaint would be the speaker volume is a little on the underwhelming side. Very solid otherwise.,0
(Very impressed for the price): After a couple of additions (2 gig Nvme and some ram) this little guy almost keeps up with my i9 10900k Alienware Aurora R11 with a 2080ti in it. I’ve been very impressed with the performance of this laptop especially for the price. I like to use it to power my Oculus Quest (use as a Rift) for PC games with Virtual Monitor and it’s done very well. It gets a little hot but I’m not friendly to it with the game settings and run everything wide open. Love having the portability of a laptop to game at work.,0
(Awesome Gaming Laptop at reasonable price): Fan sound is sometimes irritating but I think for Gaming you have to bear it.,0
"(Scam): Ordered 2 of those laptops for. Both had 2GB RAM and 32GB EMMC. Considering that RAM can not be replaced, I consider this the WORST purchase I made. Don't buy this crap.",0
"(It way better than you expect): Great price for the power it has. I was recommended to buy the Razer Blade 15 Base Gaming Laptop, although they claim it's the best gaming laptop, it was way more expensive and less powerful than my new GL65 Leopard. I'm glad I bought this amazing laptop, it runs almost every game flawlessly, at least games from 2020 and before, lets see how it holds up with New Gen games. And it supports VR too. Besides from gaming I use this laptop to work, video editing, 3D animation, coding.",0
"(Seamless Unexpected Upgrade): What’s not to like? It’s a great Apple product! Bought to replace a 2013 MacBook Pro that worked flawlessly right up until it was destroyed in an accident. Setting it up and getting on with my life was pretty seamless, as it has been on every Apple product I’ve ever upgraded. I’m enjoying the increased speed and more up to date features as a bonus — especially longer battery life!",0
(Super): Très bien,0
(Asus i7-K712EA Laptop.): This is a wonderful Laptop and very much worth the price. The USB2.0 USB's have packed up and is in for repairs but Asus has an extremely excellent backup service worldwide. This remains a wonderful productand would like to thank Amazon and the Seller for selling to South Africa.,0
"(Screen didn't turn on): I was super excited to get my wife a new laptop for her birthday because our old ones screen is cracked and she has to use the hdmi and hook it up to the tv. I let the new one charge up and go to turn it on and I can hear it talking but the screen is a true black, i hook it up through the hdmi and whatya know, it works like that, the one thing I was trying to avoid is whats wrong with it. I can't speak on how good the laptop is but I'm hesitant on buying it again after I return it but then again my lucks just bad and can't catch a break so it probably doesn't matter what I get, there's gonna be something wrong.",0
(Five Stars): Works great. Worth it especially how low price it ia,0
"(Not good for zoom): I bought this for class and it had terrible connectivity, so I had to return it.",0
"(A great buy even in the presence of M1 Pro and Max): Excellent battery, speedy, lightweight. You do not often come across these three benefits together. This is still a great purchase if you (like me) do the regular zoom meetings, graphic design, edit 4k video, some spreadsheet work and occasionally edit batches of 100 photos in raw format in Lightroom. Go spend some more in a M1 Pro or Max if you really need that much computational power for 3d or heavy 8k video editing.",0
"after a session of intense gaming, the Alienware logo button (on/off) can become exceedingly hot.",0
"(Moved from larger 2-in-1 to this smaller laptop): I was afraid that the smaller size wouldn't suit me, but have been pleasantly surprised. The screen goes almost to the very edge of the laptop and the light weight, especially compared to the 2-in-1 touchscreen model, is so nice.I do not miss not having a touchscreen, as I found I rarely used that feature on my previous laptop. There is not a 10-key keyboard, but the page up/page down, home, and delete keys are very well placed.Overall, quite pleased with the change.",0
(Laptop working fine finding difficulty in running zoom): Purchase laptop to run zoom finding difficulty with audio,0
(Impressed): I have never owned an Asus Brand PC and am quite impressed. This model is fast everything: from the startup to the graphics and sound. The fingerprint login still has issues to be worked out but works. Shipping was great no issues.,0
"(Highly recommend. Everything runs smoothly (expect if you have too ...): Highly recommend. Everything runs smoothly (expect if you have too much stuff downloaded and running in the backround making your CPU go up like me :P), Startup time is hella fast. Only flaws i have and what most of the reviews of this have in common is the screen and the harddrive. The screen is good but would be better if it had what a touchscreen would have and you would be able to see the screen clearly at all angles. For this screen, it doesnt do that. It starts to fade out when you look at it from the side and so forth. The hardrive is only 256gb which is very small. It does have 2 compartments for harddrives so if you have another harddive like a TB just install it and use that. You can upgrade your ram and in it but 8gb of ram is plenty since this laptop can run games just fine but i wouldnt recommend trying to overdrive it and see how far you can ""push it"".",0
(hard drive): it cant run very well unless you're only downloading one or two games otherwise its a great computer would definitely recommend for college and high school students,0

"(Decent enough for what it is): Got a super-long overseas flight or camping trip ahead and don't have any money left over? Then this might just be the laptop for you.PROS:Super long battery lifeRuns cool and totally silent (no fans)Dual band wifi (a very pleasant surprise)Very light (under 1kg)Easily fits into even the smallest backpacks, and even some ""Coach"" style handbagsLots of extra ports to add storage and other devices, including (most importantly) a USB-CBargain basement priceEasy to convert to Linux OS and runs it wellCeleron N4000 CPU appears to have just barely enough horsepower to run older (Orange Box era) PC gamesVideo playback is acceptable, my collection of 540p DVD backup rips plays just fine, 720p video looks good tooCan replace battery without destroying laptop (screws on bottom)CONS:2GB of RAM is a VERY severe limitation. Any more than two browser tabs open is asking for serious trouble.1080p video files play poorly (since the laptop's screen resolution is under 1080p the CPU tries to scale down the video and often can't keep up)No other user-serviceable or upgradable parts besides battery. Not being able to add more RAM to this laptop makes me very sad :(Can't charge over USB-C. Just a minor annoyance given how good the battery life is but still should be known.Screen is kinda blah, especially outdoors, but what do you really expect from a sub $150 laptopWindows 10 is just really blah overall on this laptop. It really feels like it was designed primarily as a Chromebook (*cough* Linux *cough*) computer. Virtually the entire 32GB of onboard storage is taken up by Windows.",0

"(Keep looking!!): What a disappointment. I was so excited to get my new laptop. The screen quality is aweful..graying out if I even shift a bit in my seat. The touch pad was wonky..jerky and not responsive at all, at times. But the real kicker was the volume...or lack thereof. At the highest setting we could barely hear it. So I tried eatbuds. They were even worse. If i held them crammed into my ear I could faintly hear.Just aweful all around. It is boxed and ready to be picked up for return. I have already ordered a replacement...not the same model obviously..fingers crossed!!",0

"(Awesome Laptop!): This laptop is incredible! I originally thought that since the video card isn't that great (The can you run it website told me I wouldn't be able to run most games even on the minimum settings) that I'd have issues with gaming.

Will definitely be sticking with Asus.",0
"(ASUS ZenBook 13 UX331UA Ultra-Slim Laptop 13.3”: Great until warranty expired.): I've bought my share of laptops plus more than a few desktops so I was surprised when this beautiful Zenbook started failing after 12 months (of infrequent use). It was not my primary system, I have a monster MSI for photo editing and a new desktop. So the ""Zen"" had less than 3 months of use during the Oct 2019 - Nov 2020 and then the keyboard lights stopped working and now I'm getting a flicker on the monitor. Granted this is not their top of the line system, however, for close to $900 I expected far more from ASUS in terms of quality.",0
"(Keyboard non-functional): I got this laptop for my wife so she could edit photos and play games at a mid-level of graphics processing. Unfortunately we never got far enough to test those capabilities. The keyboard had half a dozen keys that worked mechanically but we're unresponsive electronically. As a former A+/Network+ certified IT technician I figured I could update some drivers and get this running anyhow. But as I spent a few hours researching this issue I discovered that this keyboard issue is one that is a more general problem for this model of Acer laptop and that this is a known issue that has not been resolved by the manufacturer. After a few hours of attempting fixes, all to no avail, I returned this device for a refund. I recommend anyone looking for a lower end gaming laptop pay the extra $50-$100 to go with another brand and avoid this model altogether.",0

I would recommend buying a cooling pad.The only thing i didn't like was the touch pad. It feels kinda clunky to me. I gave it 4 stars because the network wifi adapter is not working properly (currently in contact with support in order to find a solution).",0
"(OK quality, no CD/DVD drive, poorly packaged for shipping.): This laptop seems to work fine, usually powers up fast, was relatively easy to setup and use, and generally just works. It does NOT come with a CD/DVD drive, so expect to spend another $20-50 for a plug in variety if you need one. This laptop does come with a lot of bloatware and I am still working to remove the non-essentials. Overall it feels a little on the cheap (flimsy side) relative to an HP laptop I have at the office, but for light use at home and as a back up to my almost new Dell all-in-one with a dead motherboard, it's fine. Packaging was very poor. There was very little material to cushion the laptop box so it knocked around a lot inside the shipping box, and the shipping box arrived damaged. It appears the laptop was undamaged, but I am a little worried that something will show up later.",0

"(Solid State Drive does not have capacity to update without adding additional Drive): Out of the box the 11.6"" screen and keyboard for this device seem smallish. No problem, going onto a small kitchen desk. The issue for me is that right out of the box it asked me to create more space for the update it was attempting to perform. I ended up adding an additional drive just to get it up and running. I looked at the internal storage and more than half the solid state drive was eaten up by the OS. Not sure this is well engineered with the software included. I think it needs at least double the capacity it contains. Going to give it some time, Dell and Amazon, but right now thinking this will be sent back after Christmas. My wife will be the determing factor since this will be hers.",0

"(An excellent highly rated budget gaming laptop): I bought this to replace an ACER v5-571 that I've had since 2013. My previous Acer was excellent, needing only a HDD in almost 8 years of hard daily business use. In my search for a replacement laptop, I specifically wanted a discrete graphics card instead of the built in Intel Graphics. My laptop is plugged in 99.9% of the time so I have no idea of battery life. I'm not a big gamer, just occasionally. Based on mostly Rave reviews online and you tube, and my previous Acer experience, I was excited to find the Nitro 5 for an excellent price. I was concerned about the small ssd drive of 256 gb as I do a lot of graphics work. I added a 256gb thumb drive to the USB 3 port for just over $30 on Amazon, now I have a more acceptable 512GB storage. I have 2 areas that could be improved. First is it takes several steps to activate the Geforce GTX 1650 video card in the Windows settings as it is disabled on arrival. Also, the volume of MAXX sound thru the built in speakers is weak. I definitely recommend this to others. I also advise purchasers to check the specs of this laptop on Amazon as there are multiple listings of Nitro 5 with previous years cpu's. The 2019 version should have the Intel I5-9300H processor.",0

Así que si se carga apagado estás cargando a ciegas.El sonido que tiene en las bocinas no es muy bueno, aunque se entiende que sea así por el tamaño y la forma del dispositivo.El sistema operativo es un mastodonte que no anda rápido, pide constantemente esperar para apagar. La primera vez que esperé para apagar Windows 10 se tardó dos horas por actualizaciones o configuración inicial supongo.Para almacenar muchas cosas echarás en falta un disco externo o unidades usb o sd cards.Para alguien que necesite lo básico y no exija mucho es buena opción. Solo tomar en cuenta que:Si tienes conocimientos técnicos o alguien cercano que los tiene, lo mejor es optar por un sistema operativo alterno como Linux, en mi caso puse Debian.

For the short amount of time that it was working, it was amazing and played all games at max flawlessly. The battery life is inconsistent to what is in the detail description. Battery life without gaming, and just web browsing/watching a movie was about 2-3 hours MAX. If gaming, it will probably last 30-45 mins MAX.",0
"(Exceptional device. Tips about screen calibration!): Exceptional laptop. With that 8th gen Core i5, it's such a pleasure to use this for anything (heck, I was playing a freaking 8K video and a 4K video at the same time and it still wouldn't drop frames), all while battery life is absolutely great. The chassis is sturdy yet very light weight. Really not much to complain about. If you want a lightweight, premium, top performance ultrabook, this is the one to get.My only gripe was that the display seemed to have a bit of green tint, very noticeable when compared to my phone's calibrated display or the Samsung Chromebook Pro I tried for a while, but lowering the Green contrast to 46 from 50 in Intel Graphics settings solved it. I also bumped the saturation just +5, and the screen looks gorgeous now–very similar to my small Pixel 2 which is very well calibrated. Only tip is to uninstall ASUS Splendid Video Enhancement Utility as it doesn't allow Intel Graphics Settings to stay after sleep or reboot for some reason, probably because both have calibration options and conflict with each other.With the display fixed, this thing is 10/10. Fan noise is actually very low or non existent in most tasks. Only when I put it under heavy load (like syncing 12,000 files on Google Backup & Sync) do you hear it and even then it's not annoying. And the touchpad does accidentally trigger 'double tap and drag' when you don't want to a few times, but honestly I usually disable 'double tap to drag' because I rarely drag and when I do, it's more natural to click and drag instead of double tapping.This is a great buy that will last you for a long time given the sturdy chassis and future-proof specs.",0

Asus will respond and tell everyone who reports this issue (There are many) to uninstall and reinstall the driver. Or to send the laptop in for repair. But this low sound is a design defect. Reinstalling drivers won't do anything. And unless Asus redesigns the speaker system sending the laptop in for repairs won't fix anything because it's not broken. It's a design defect. Asus used cheap speakers and placed them on the bottom of the laptop. Sound is always muffled and low. Other than the sound I really love this laptop.,0
"(My favorite device by far): So i had this computer chromebook for a year now, and i got to say. This is a very good device! I been using it a lot and the keyboard is easy to use and the touch screen is amazing! The battery life can be work on a bit, but it does perfom very well with heavy usage. I don't like the touch pad very much, maybe it's just me but i feel like it lags just barely. I bough a logitech mouse so its not a big deal for me, but even when i'm not home, i simply navigate using the touch screen so it doesnt effect me. I'm hook with chromebooks, if one day i ever need another one, i know what i will be looking for.",0
"(Quick and straighforward): I got this for my less technologically-inclined mother to use for basic browsing/videos/netflix/email etc. and it's perfect. It took about one whole minute to set up, it's responsive, and I found the build quality/sturdiness impressive for the price point. Almost wish I'd bought one for myself too!",0
"(Terrible trackpad): It's a great laptop but for one major issue. The trackpad will work fine for a while, then it will stop responding, or get slow, or move the cursor back and forth by itself. I hope they come out with an update. This is a really bad problem.",0
"It's lightweight, fast & the graphics are good quality.",0
(Great performance and bang for your buck!): This is very fast compared to my old MSI that was not a slouch. Very quick start up and good gamer for Blizzard games.,0
"(Performance!): Quality laptop with all the bells & whistles, style & performance at a decent price!",0
(Four Stars): Thank you😊,0
"(Slim and light laptop): Delivery took ard 17days..Consider alright since if from US shipment via DHL.Item seem good..need to test the device. Speaker was good and ok to me.. most feedback not so loud..but I find it good.. laptop is slim and light. 13.3 inch, i7 model,512gb. Screen on 60hz still looks good due to super ambled screen",0
"(Everything works perfectly with Linux): This hardware is highly compatible with Linux. I am using Arch on this, and everything works out of the box --- no special drivers were needed.It seems to be reasonably fast, and the only downside for me is the screen brightness. While I think it is sharp enough, it is less bright than I care for. (However, others that used this screen find it more to their taste in terms of brightness, so this is very much a matter of opinion rather than fact.)The real pleasure here of course the price; a 15.6 screen, 128 gigabyte SSD, an I3 processor, and 8 gigabytes of memory are quite good specs for a $400 machine.",0
(Good): Like,0
(Awesome device): So far I love it. First chromebook,0
Runs all the computer games and programs that I need.,0
(Works great): Works great! No problems. Fast service,0
"(So far, so good.): Just got this bad boy and I have to admit I am impressed so far with MSI build quality.The screen is beautiful, IPS is the way to go, 144hz can't complain.Price is good for what you get, a strong cpu and gpu that will give you at least three good years of little to no compromise gaming. Very little deck flex on the keybroad, keys are crisp with a decent click, it not the best laptop keybroad but it is far from the worse.Cons:Gamery aesthetics, though the backlit keybroad being RGB is a good thing.Construction is mostly plastic and cheapens the look of the laptop but I understand they need to save money somewhere. Cooling could always be better on most gaming laptops but at this price point I can't really complain but the fans do get loud; so have some good headphones.",0
(Quick little computer): Looked at so many computers didn't realize it didn't have a 10key. But I really love how fast the computer moves. I can. Log in within seconds of waking up the computer. I will always buy HP from now on. Oh it's really light too.,0
"(Light and Fast): My husband and I are not very tech savy people, but we really like our ZenBook. It is very lightweight and very fast.",0
(Top-of-the line laptop): Very light and durable. Works at high speed and holds plenty of storage. I would reorder for my office.,0
"(not bad for a budget gaming laptop): Very fast for average tasks and can play just about any game at the right settings. Fans are loud when under load, and storage is not very large, but upgrading memory is very easy, an extra m.2 and sata slot is nice. I think the sweet spot for this is between 600-700$",0
(Will work under Linux with a little fix): Works well under Linux. Only issue noticed is the touchpad doesn't work out of the box. This can be fixed by running the following as root/sudo----cd /sys/class/gpio/echo 386 > exportcd gpio386echo out > direction----I've opted to make this persistent by saving it as a script and running it as a reboot cron job as sudo.,0
"(Lots of screen bleed and overheats after 6 months): Screen has a lot of bleed at the corners. After about 6 months many of my games began to over heat the cpu after an hour and a hslf of play. I cannot even play Alpha Protocol on high game setting. GPU seems cool and the air coming out is cool, but whete vpu is at there is no air flow. Otherwise its an alright computer..",0
Customer service was great,0
"(Excelente dispositivo): la laptop es algo pesada, un poquito gruesa pero la verdad es mas compacta que el resto, con suficiente potencia para todo lo que necesito, el color es bonito y elegante, viene bien protegida y en excelente estado, no tengo quejas sobre esta laptop. la recomendaria para quienes inician en diseño o cualquier tarea de oficina o multimedia. es muy cómoda para usarla.",0

(Equipo calidad precio.): Es un equipo muy bueno para su precio en cuanto a hardware es muy buena cumple sus tareas correctamente.La calidad de la pantalla es un 8 de 10 muy buena si que es IPS y se nota.La batería en alto rendimiento dura unos 150 minutos.El rendimiento en juegos es bueno corre juegos actuales y obvio muchísimos clásicos.El chasis es lo.peor del equipo así como el teclado se siente de mala calidad lo que compensa todo lo demás como.digo es calidad precio.Recomendable para gente que la usa sin transportarla tanto aún que se siente firme les dejo el vídeo espero dicipe un poco sus dudas.,0
(Easy to carry): Loved the zenbook for its lightness and easy to carry. Good battery life. It will be better if ssd drive can can be higher capacity.,0
I am having a lot of fun designing keyboard light layouts,0
"(Excelente producto): Buena relación calidad precio, esta computadora debería de ser vista como una inversión, excelente para un inicio de clases y trabajo, pero la mayor aportación de la computadora, es que puedes agregarle más RAM y otro disco SSD sin dificultad, y aparte, conservar los predefinidos, por ejemplo, si agregas una RAM de 8gb, tendrás al final una computadora de 12gb, suficiente para correr programas pesados o inclusive algunos juegos actuales.Gran compra.",0
"(looking good and going fast): everything came as advertised, and i couldn't be happier. wasn't filled with a ton of ad ware and useless crap, light RTS gaming is great and daily work and reports are a breeze. can't say enough how much i have enjoyed this laptop over the last few months since I got it and I get compliments on it everywhere i go. great machine for the price.",0
Top of the laptop is metal and the rest is a super sturdy brushed plastic.,0
"(Excelente Equipo Calidad y Precio de primera): Es un excelente equipo, vengo de un PC de escritorio y es mi primer Laptop con Tarjeta de Video dedicada, me animé sobre todo por que tiene memoria RAM DDR5, lo mejor fue el precio, por poco menos de 19k considero que es una ganga por las prestaciones que ofrece, le agregue 32gb de RAM y un SSD extra de 1TB ya sumando todo me gaste 24k. Me fue mejor que la TUF 2021 que estaba en 30kAunque no la usare principalmente para jugar, he probado algunos juegos y corre bastante bien el Gears 5, Halo TMCC, Halo Infinite, la temperatura es adecuada y como todo dispositivo requerirá sus mantenimientos oportunos, Para jugar prefiero usar mis consolas o bien la de escritorio que puedo exigirle el máximo sin preocuparme de las temperaturas.Para la programación, programas de edición y gráficos es muy buen equipo, es una buena compra para cualquier estudiante que requiera de un equipo con buenas prestaciones.El equipo de 16GB de RAM y SSD de 500GB a como viene de fabrica es excelente, si puedes agrégale más RAM o bien aumenta el SSD que 500GB los consumes en poco tiempo.Pros:-Procesador de última generación-Memoria RAM DDR5-Slot extra M.2-Buena duración de batería 4-6 hrs en modo Eco-Dise?o sobrio, excelente que la iluminación sea blanco y no el árbol de navidad rgb-Touchpad de muy buen tama?o-Teclado Completo-Pantalla más que excelente-Puertos USB C, HDMI es excelente que aún incluya este puerto.-Buen sonido, bastante equilibrado-Buenos materiales de construcciónContras:-SSD de fabrica muy sencillo-16GB en 2x8GB lo que te obliga a comprar 2 memorias para expandir-Cámara web justa-La apertura de cubierta inferior es sencilla pero si eres principiante puede ser un poco complicado",0

"(Great laptop, lacking memory.): It's all in the title. Laptop is great, performs great for long hours of gaming. To get the best performance, you need to keep it plugged in. Otherwise, it goes into a battery saving mode so the performance while gaming starts lacking. The stream quality is still great for videos when unplugged. Only thing I would say negative about this laptop is the storage space is low but you can easily buy external storage.",0
"(Pissed off beyond belief): I bought this system knowing it only had 512 Meg SSD, but everything I read online stated you could add another hard drive. This is false, you cannot install another internal drive. There is a slot, a bracket but no connector to hook a cable to... There is an upgrade document that says you can do all of this.. This is my 5th Asus Laptop.. You've lost a customer.",0
(Awesome): Bought this for my middle schooler!! It’s perfect works great!! Perfect for the price!!,0
(Laptop is not charging.): Very disappointing. The laptop is not charging and I bought it for my son who needs it for school. I plan on returning item as soon as I find out how to do so. Also in the title it says it was an Aspire E15 laptop and I got an E5. Don't go the cheap way unless you know the product is of great quality.,0
"(Perfect little machine for internet surfers!): I chose this laptop for my 76y/o mom, who is not tech savvy. Her old laptop only had 2g ram and 24g hard drive — antiquated! She likes to watch YouTube videos, look at FB, and search Bible information.This laptop can do so much more if needed. For the price you can’t beat it. I think it could support MS Office Suite just fine and possibly even Quickbooks.I wouldn’t try gaming or heavy graphic editing software such at Adobe Photoshop or their Creative Cloud. I believe it would get bogged down.All in all a good laptop.",0
(Great product): Screen quality could be better other wise I’m happy with this choice of brand,0
"(All around good machine, minor flaws, maybe it's just a bad batch?): I bought this since all of my apple products won't run Linux, and well I'm tired of Apple.Overall the build quality is nice for a $750 laptop. The i5 processor is fast enough to get things done (writing software/browsing/minor video editing). 8gb of ram is ""ok"", but it'd be lovely to have 16gb even if the cost was a bit more as the ram is not upgradable. The SSD is decent but there are faster drives out there, again for the price point not a big deal. 99% of your average consumers won't notice the IO difference between the onboard SSD and something more high end.The reason why I gave it only 4 stars was due to the fact I've had to return this model twice due to screen artifacts and bleeding. I'm not sure if I got 2 bad units in a 6 month span, but either way it's annoying. It's not extremely noticeable but when you're writing code, it can obscure your view.If the screen issues could be resolved, I'd buy another one in a second. Sadly, I'm going to look at other Linux-compatible laptops.Oh and Ps... if you are running Linux a couple of things.1.) Go for Mint, Ubuntu, or Debian as it is supported out of the box2.) If you want that gimmicky fingerprint reader to work, good luck with that lol",0
"(Great little laptop!!): I love the touchscreen. The older I get the worse my eyes are. I can easily enlarge the screen to read emails, articles, etc. It was super easy to set up when I took it out of the box. For what I do on the computer this is the perfect one for me.",0
"(Turned out to be a great purchase!): My daughter uses this all the time, daily. Loves this. Works great for playing Roblox & for all of her needs. Absolutely a great buy!",0
"(Can’t use for remote access): If you just want to surf the net, I suppose it’s fine.",0
"The battery is good for a performance laptop, the quality is great so far, and it's extremely convenient that it's so light.",0
"(Compatible with TEAMGROUP Elite): I upgraded the 3060 version with one TEAMGROUP T-FORCE CARDEA ZERO Z330 1TB, and a TEAMGROUP Elite DDR4 32GB Kit (2 x 16GB) 3200MHz PC4-25600 CL22 kit, the SSD NVME was not immediatly recognized, but I only had to give it NTFS format due to unallocated memory data, no BIOS settings needed for it to detect it afterwards, I have not yet tested its performance, but the screen has at least 350 NITs, overall feels very solid.Will update after testing.",0
"(Falla en el equipo): He tenido la desafortunada experiencia, que me llego este producto con un da?o en el puerto de carga, hay que estar sosteniendo el cable de carga, para que el equipo cargue. El equipo funciona bien, pero esta falla se vuelve un problema ya que el equipo lo traje a Latinoamérica, me resulta mas caro hacer la devolución y que me entreguen uno nuevo, que buscar un técnico que lo arregle localmente y perder la garantía.",0
"(Don't Buy!): It restarts like every 5 minutes or so. Don't but this,7-19-19 tech support was great but this laptop still suck!",0
"(DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY): Totally unreliable. Stopped working in 3 weeks. Will not turn on. I researched fixes on YouTube and tried everything that was suggested without success. I am on an extended overseas trip for several months and had to purchase a new laptop in order to stay connected with work and family, a hassle I did not need. Not sure if I can even return this item for a full refund when I return to the US.",0
"(Good, solid laptop but weak audio quality): This laptop is a solid, well-built device with speed, great display, and a good keyboard. The only downside I see is the audio quality. Not as good as I had hoped.",0
"(High price and performance ratio): Extraordinarily high price and performance ratio. The combination of r7 4700 and 1660Ti Enable me playing most of the game I used to play in high quality like apex,pubg and csgo. Seldom does it occur underlocking so the heat dissipation is quite effective as well. Overall it can able to replace desktop for gaming in terms of performance. If you are a student living in dormitory, I think it is a best choice for you as it is relatively cheap, portable and great in performance.The only disadvantage is that it is quite heavy comparing to other clerical laptops therefore it may take you more physical efforts in carrying it.",0
"(Design Flaw): Other than the high temperature this laptop can reach I cannot understand the design of the edges, why are they so sharp or was mine not finished. There are 2 sharp edges at both ends of the base facing the user. That's a dangerous flaw.",0
"(Good laptop for the price): I had to replace my 10 yr old Toshiba due to Win 7 not being updated any longer, so after much investigation, I went for this sleek HP model. I'm impressed with the screen clarity and crispness when watching movies, but the HD display does prove to be challenging when working with Photoshop 6 and a couple game sites. I have to decrease the screen resolution in order to manage these older programs. I love the backlit keyboard, however, the NumLock doesn't have a light telling me when it's engaged, which is annoying. I saw one review state there were red pilot lights to tell if something is on or off, but I don't have that on this laptop, unless there's something I've missed. The keyboard backlight shuts off after about 30 seconds of not touching the board, which is spooky at first, as I didn't know what I was doing to make it go off. But this is a really nice addition and saves battery life. The construction is sleek and almost too thin for me as I'm afraid I'll bend it when I open it. It also scratches easily if one wears a watch or bracelet, etc. I now take those off when I'm typing. I would have prefered a padded style lid, but I can certainly live with this. I removed the McAfee antivirus as I pay for another program and have never had good results with McAfee. Once set up to my preferences, this laptop really does show it's speed. It surpasses the benchmark test.Boot time is extremely fast, and though it has the least expensive GeForce MX250 graphics card, it performs extremely well. USB ports are fast and have no hesitation in recognizing any flash drives.The sound is acceptable but the description says it has 'immersive sound' but there is no setting to adjust that,. I'd like to know if this is a mistake on the seller's part, Battery life is about 8 hours, from what I've found. All in all, for the price, this is an excellent purchase, even though I have a few things I'd like to see changed.EDIT Aug 28,2020: I've never had a need to use the mic or camera and for the life of me cannot get the mic setup. It says it has a integrated dual array digital microphone but I've no idea how to set it up. I tried to use my old mic/speaker headset with a splitter and can't get Cortana to recognize it. I'm bummed and not quite certain what to do next. Supposedly the 'array' is on the front panel, but I sure don't find it. I didn't buy mine from this particular seller, so will have to contact them. I do find the backlighting very nice but on a silver background the color needs to be blue or red as under lights, the feature is useless.",0
"(so far, so good): When my son's PC crashed heading into finals week, this was a quick, easy, workable solution for him. Virtually no set-up, lightweight and easy to stow in the backpack, and small enough to easily use in the classroom for note taking. He was able to get online, read his online textbooks, complete, and submit assignments via his university's portal with no issues. I don't know how long it will last, but it's doing the job we need it to do for now.",0
"I'm able to run at the highest graphic settings, with ray tracing set to it's highest and also get very playable frame rates.",0
"(Works like it's supposed to.): It has no capslock that key is replaced with a search key, which is odd, but otherwise works as well as any other 4gb RAM laptop.",0
"(It's working okay so far. We can't seem to ...): It's working okay so far. We can't seem to get rid of the password option. It asks for it every time it starts up, and we don't need that.",0
"(Worth the price for performance but you might have to buy a separate screen): The laptop came and I was completely satisfied with the performance, cooling, weight, size, and battery life.But I had some problem with the keyboard, the control key is too small, the delete key is not where most keyboards have it, which is not much of a complaint every keyboard is different I would've just had to get used to it.My main problem and the reason why I returned it, is the screen. The first time I opened it I already noticed a much brighter screen at max brightness which is a good thing, but to me, it looked like there was a yellowish warm tint to it similar to having night mode on.I tried everything to fix it, checking if night mode was on(it wasn't).I googled the issue and apparently, some people had issues with the brightness on the predator helios 300 I followed the steps and the screen was even brighter but it still had the tint.I checked the graphic card's control panel but I didn't know what to change to fix it, everything was on default.My final fix was to calibrate the screen decreasing the gamma level, and the green, red colors but it still looks a little weird and it resets every time I turn the laptop off.I kept thinking that it was just me and I wasn't used to it, but I was never disoriented when I go from one screen to another. Now though it happens regularly when I go from my phone screen to this laptop screen.I tried to contact support, but they told me that I would need to send it in for repairs and that it'll take 7 days. Since I was already dissatisfied with the keyboard as well I decided to return it.",0
(Computerrrr): Love it! My touch pad gets a little retarded sometimes and doesn't work but otherwise its great!,0
"(So great): I had an iMac from 2013 that has been slowly losing life, so I decided to replace it with a MacBook. I love this little thing! So lightweight, charges fast, battery lasts a super long time, sound and picture quality is super clear and crisp - it's just a great little machine!I LOVE the fingerprint for passwords feature and that it can be unlocked with the Apple Watch - I feel like such a snob saying that, but it's really convenient!It's definitely an expensive machine, but god I would pay the price over and over.",0
"(No regrets, hands down, favorite laptop for its price.): Great price for an amazing laptop. RAM and SSD would be the only thing to upgrade and get the top notch gaming experience. This thing runs at 100 fps on high settings and 150 with normal settings. Fans are a bit loud and pretty recognizable but it doesnt name me feel like I regret purchasing this. I fell in love with this laptop and is definitely worth it",0
"(WOW!!!!!): I had an Asus computer before I purchased this MSI!! I was pretty excited to get it after I ordered it since my friend had nothing but good things to say about their MSI. Well, I am not disappointed!!!!!! This bad boy started up and I didn't have to wait for it to actually get ready to use, I have been doing that for a year!!!! The keyboard is fantastic and I love the colors!!! The thickness is a bit getting used to but I find that my wrist isn't hurting like they were, so that's a plus. The only thing that I am having issues with is that I run my mouse into the charging cord every so often, but that is easily the smallest thing that I have found wrong!!! Wish I had taken the leap sooner!!!",0
"(Good product): It is a good product. Keyboard smaller than I was used to, learning to work with it.",0
"(10/10): You get what you pay for, and that $1000 I dropped on this MacBook was worth. I went through a few cheap laptops that went from $200-400 bc I needed it for my college classes and then after wasting my time buying and returning them, I finally decided to go all out and no regrets with this purchase. 10/10",0
"(Not good for gaming, not HD space): 500GB hd inadequate. Needed turbo mode to do VR, it's just enough, but not enough to play games. Over priced at the time I bought it for what it's made of. Ot enough memory, storage or processing. It's an easy pass, but heck it's been almost 2 years,, it wasn't enough then, so why make the review? Moore's law..should have been good enough..bottom line it's just Amazon's skewed ratings",0
"(Un buen equipo para trabajo de ofimática y estudiar.): Muy contento con el producto, cumple con lo esperado, llego bastante rápido a Colombia.",0
"(Good Quality): My Phone. My Car. My Acer Aspire 5. Those 3 things I use daily. I am a college student taking half of my classes online and this computer has yet to let me down. I have owned it for a little over 2 months and have seen more pros than cons. The ability to use zoom and microsoft word with it can be used extensively for schoolwork no matter the level.This is my first laptop of my own besides my high school providing us with chromebooks. They were Dell Intel Chromebook 3100 and all it did was get the job done which wasn’t in the most convenient ways. It was smaller and slower, and the difference between the two is impeccable. The quickness of the loading time and the fact it was very easy to get a hang of. As macbooks are seen as one of the best laptops in the market it is double the price at $1,000. It may not have all the specs of a macbook like connecting your iphone along to it, but it can definitely make up for it with the wireless connection being quick. This computer can also connect to an Xbox or a Samsung phone.This model is a slim build but is a little wider than a regular chromebook. If you are unsure what that could be relating to, think of a cutting board you may have in your kitchen. The elevated design of the computer for when you open it is very beneficial for when you are trying to relax and get schoolwork done without straining your neck when using it for a long time. As the elevation might not be a massive difference the half inch incline will come into effect when you least expect it and when you don’t even realize it.The battery runs a little quicker than I would like. To combat that I just have to remember to charge it overnight. Along with that sometimes the touchpad mouse drags a little bit. For example if I were clicking on a new tab sometimes it would drag the tab out and separate it from the others creating a new window. It gets really annoying when I’m trying to go back and forth between tabs for my classes and such. With a mouse I have found no problem in that area as it may be the touchpad being too sensitive. The laptop offers USB ports on each side so there won’t be an inconvenience with connecting a mouse.While this laptop is what I use for my schoolwork there have been no issues on that part. If you are looking to purchase a laptop for a reason other than school like gaming or something, this may not be the laptop for your needs. I have yet to do anything more extensive than schoolwork mainly using programs such as blackboard and launchpad. No issues there on my part.",0
(very pleased): i love it and it’s perfect for school and it comes with so many amazing features,0
"(Excelente): Me gusto, realmente como nueva, en perfecto estado y funcionando muy bien, estoy contento con el producto y a un precio excelente.",0
"(Power cord is faulty): I am sure the computer itself is fine. However, I only had it a month and it would not hold a charge. I sent it to Samsung for repair and they said nothing was wrong with it. Turns out, it is a faulty power cord so now I have to order another cord.",0
"(Superó mis expectativas): la recomiendo totalmente. después de seis meses de uso, me he dado cuenta que funciona 100/100. estoy encantada con ella, es la mejor inversión que he hecho. me gusta que el teclado se puede personalizar (el color). todo corre sensacionalmente. no tengo ninguna falla con ella. tiene poca memoria de almacenamiento pero para hacer el upgrade es muy fácil, otro punto a su favor y pues que les puedo decir. corre el cyberpunk bien fluido jajajaj y sin bugs. así, nomás hay un detalle que no se si será solo en mi compu o algo. pero cuando estoy jugando sin cable lan o algo se desconecta el internet. no se si será por una configuración o algo pra ahorrar batería pero es molesto estar en medio de una partida o algo y pum bye internet, y no porque sea relacionado a algo del módem (si es la compu)",0
I am old fashioned and like typing with a number pad way better than using the upper keys on a keyboard.,0
It works like a beast and transferring over my stuff onto this new one was super easy.,0
"(First Mac for a PC guy and software developer): I'm a software developer and I've only used PC for my entire career. I've been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and I've always had the desire to try development on a Mac.I assumed that it would be like any other Windows machine that's had the OS replaced with Linux, one of my favorite computers was a Lenovo with Ubuntu on it so that's what I expected.I bought a Surface Pro X which has an ARM based processor (ms sq1 chip) so I thought that I knew what to expect, I assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software I used probably wouldn't work correctly but I have to say that Apple did so much better than Microsoft on this one. The M1 chip makes this $1,000 laptop feel like a $2500 laptop. I've only run into one application that couldn't run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me.the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once I did, this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my Surface laptop 3 as my daily driver and primary software development machine.I might revert to my Surface laptop three if I go back to .NET development in the future but for the general web stuff I typically do, I couldn't ask for a better machine.The battery life is excellent, this laptop feels premium, I have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about Apple.The biggest downside in my opinion is that I spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because Apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating.One thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can't connect this laptop to two separate external displays. I had to get used to One external display and then using a virtual desktop. That is unfortunate because I really liked having three monitors at all times but I haven't found a way to make it work with this machine.Generally speaking, I would recommend this to anybody who's considering it. Unless you are a PC gamer, there's very little that this computer won't excel at. I'd argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two, and I have historically been very critical of Apple.",0
"(Bookmark manager has been weakened.): I was disappointed to find that the options under 'bookmark manager"" have been changed. It had been on my older chromebook, that a bookmark entry could be chosen and the options included 'cut' and 'paste'. This allowed me to arrange the bookmarks by priority. Now any new entry goes to the end of the list with no way to move it closer to the top of the list. Bad...Bad. Otherwise I like the chromebook.",0
(Don't WASTE YOYR MONEY): This was the worse. Purchase it ever made. First off it was a 218.00 at best buy brand new...i paid 400 and something...and it wasn't new it was returned and I had so many files on it and a lot of viruses my son has to fills it where I could use it ...and they wanted 50% to restock. Ridiculous....It wish I would've read the reviews firsthand now its doesn't work cause its says my wifi adapter isn't. Downloaded right or something. I still can't take classes,0
"(I loved this little chromebook at first): I loved this little chromebook at first. I bought it for a trip because its compact and lightweight. But, one day before my trip the wifi goes out. It won't even turn on. Seems like quite a few others have had this issue with the chromebooks. Good thing it died now...one day left for returns. Expensive paperweight.",0
"(EXCELENTE EQUIPO): UN EQUIPO CON PROCESADOR DE DECIMA GENERACION, SSD M.2, 8 GB DE RAM, ULTRA LIGERA PESA MENOS DE 3 KG, CARCASA DE ALUMINIO LECTOR DE HUELLAS DIGITALES , WINDOWS INCLUIDO POR ESE PRECIO 10,000 MXN LO QUE PAGUE POR ELLA ES UNA GANGA EL EQUIPO SE COMPORTA MUY BIEN A LAS EXIGENCIAS QUE QUE AH TENIDO.",0
I received NONE of these items when I received the unit from Amazon!,0
"(Small and functional): Very good for internet browsing and school work. Not for gaming or any other processor/memory intensive task. Very easy to use and set up. It's also small and has a lightweight charger. I'd say it's a good deal if you're a student, have a limited knowledge of tech, or just want a small, light computer to watch videos or browse the web. There's no touch screen, but given the price I'm not complaining.",0
"(Velocidad, hardware reciente): Gran velocidad de encendido, carga, ejecución de aplicaciones. último hardware en procesador, memoria, video, disco. Teclado impecable, marcos diminutos, ligera de peso, amplio touchpad, teclado numérico incorporado con mínimos marcos en la base para tener el máximo espacio posible completamente aprovechado.",0
the keyboard lights are nice,0
(Computer Effiency): Excellent Computer - Easy to use,0
"(Good ultrabook with some flaws): Fast computer. Good connectivity. Great build quality, durability and appearance. Wonderful screen and battery life. Speakers are pretty good once you turn off the wavesmaxx ""enhancements"".And now the bad...I'm coming from a Lenovo ThinkPad from 2010, which has the gold standard in laptop keyboards. The XPS 13 keyboard is not easy to type on. I feel like the keys are just millimeters off in terms of placement and spacing. Travel is shallow. I have never made so many errors typing. When I need to correct one of my many errors, I find the backspace key is way too small. The enter key is also lacking in girth. This keyboard, while it seems well constructed with very little flex, just plain sucks for touch typing.The camera placement is terrible.The LED on the power button is annoying, the LED on the charging cable is unnecessary, the LED on the front of the case which is eye level while watching a video in bed is atrocious. Dell, please make this able to be disabled in the software.The display driver does some awful ""adaptive"" contrast/brightness adjustment based on what you have on the screen. Dell, give your users the option to DISABLE THIS.",0
"(Works almost as expected): This is a great improvement over my ancient Dell D800. Because it runs Microsoft Windows as the operating system, the laptop requires about three minutes to start all of the basic services and processes before one can reasonably use it.One issue: when plugging in a USB thumb drive, the wireless keyboard and wireless mouse did not function properly. I purchased a powered USB hub to resolve this issue.This laptop is being used by me for DAW (Digital Audio Workshop), with vocal recording for my music. I also use it for video editing and rendering. For my other computer needs, I still use the Dell.",0
"(poor quality.): aluminum chassis???? pure platic, poor quality... some burn pixels on the monitor also the network card is not working. Bad purchase... don't buy it.",0
(Delivered with care): Use it downstairs when desk top computer is one and on-half flights away in my home office. Very valuable especially to me. I have increasing movement issues. Deliverer actually waited for me to get to the door so he could hand it directly to me. I really appreciated it.,0
mouse pad trying to right click is a total pain. Almost every time it registered as a left click instead.,0
"(Great for the price fast speeds on both graphics and wifi): I really liked this LaptopIf there was one think i would change is just add more drive space, 250gb isn't enough these days for games, so be wary you may want to buy a second drive, luckily this comes with an additional connector",0
"(It goes where you go, does what you do.): Pros:-Extremely lightweight. Weighs less than my journal. I can carry both of them in a reasonably sized purse and not hurt my shoulder.-Boots up in a blink. Hit the power button and plug it in, it will be ready before you are.-Looks and feels nice. The plastic seems sturdy, the keys don't stick*, the mousepad feels pleasant.-Reasonable volume and brightness settings. It doesn't get super loud, but for normal usage situations it's fine.-Syncs flawlessly with my android phone. Google's integration is as good as apple's now, I get notifications on the chromebook a little faster than the galaxy usually!-The battery life is excellent (I get 6-8 hours of normal university student usage out of it) and even when I'm using it, it charges as fast as my phone.Cons:-It does slow down noticeably if you're doing too much at once. If I have a video call going on facebook messenger, chrome will take three or four seconds to respond. However, other than video calls it does really well. I can play a browser game while watching youtube and chatting with friends with only a split second delay when switching tabs. If you're going to be doing a lot of heavy lifting, this might not be the chromebook for you.-The spacebar is finnicky. It doesn't like to be tapped too close to the mousepad and sometimes it won't respond if you press it too quickly. Not an issue for most people, but if you're a speedy typist it could be an issue- I only notice this problem when I'm going 75+ wpm. Could also just be a flaw in my unit.- The screen touches the keys when the screen is closed, so your keys transfer smudges from the corners to your screen. I've only had it for a month but I'll be monitoring for any long-term damage this could cause.Overall, the problems are fairly minor and for the price I'm happy with what I got. I'm travelling overseas with it, and it goes everywhere I do and does everything I do- except I can no longer multitask and annoy my mother in video calls!",0
"(Good budget Chromebook option): Works great. Screen isn’t amazing but for the price, it gets the job done fine. If you’re already using Google Products, a Chromebook does seem more useful than an iPad.",0

(Excelente computadora para el rango de precio falta un poco en el audio pero el resto es excelente): 报告滥用情况,0
"(Fast but not a good screen): Pro:Good price. Nice size? easy to handle ? light weight ? good battery lifeCon:Dull screen. Not enough brightnrss. If I knew this is how the screen is going to look, I would have not purched this laptop.",0
"(Ubuntu Linux worked great after I disable the secure boot function. Very nice!): I'm a linux person, not a windows or macos person. So after going into bios, (f1 or escape, if i recall) (f12 for boot selection), I then just had to disable secure boot, and ubuntu installed and ran very smoothly. Wifi ran without any driver installation whatsoever. It's been great!",0
(Great for teens): Bought this for my 15 year old. He loves it. Works really well for his gaming and homework needs.,0
(Very good product for price): Bought this for my elementary age grandson.Mostly gor research and school work. Does what it needs to perfectly! I recommend!!,0
"(Awesome Machine): Any qualms you might have about purchasing this machine, throw them out the window and click ""add to cart"". Thank me later.",0
"(Slow processing speed and touchscreen is lacking): This chromebook is slow, and touchscreen is not very responsive. Also, the chromebook operating system is not ideal for people who need shortcuts on the desktop to navigate their device. If you are familiar with chromebooks and like the operating system this wont be an issue, but for those used to the easy navigation of a windows device, it may be. Overall, I would have been willing to work with the operating system had the device not taken a good 15-30 seconds to load each application that I attempted to open",0
The design is sleek and pleasing,0
The touchscreen mode works seamlessly,0
(Compact): Husband loves it! Very light weight and small.,0
"(This thing shuts down running LOL. Worst gaming laptop ever): Right out of the box this laptop has been shutting off playing simple game, literally solitaire…. I do not recommend this for a gaming laptop or even a day to day use laptop. It’s bugged and terrible.",0
"(Nice hardware, poor software): I was in love with this laptop before the first blue screen. After some troubleshooting, factory resetting the laptop a few times I was obligated to try something different, a full reinstall from scratch. It did work for a while them blue screens again. I have tested and stressed my laptop and I have no hardware issue. Only problem I’m facing after a full install from scratch is that predator software doesn’t launch. When I try to install it windows says that it has unsigned drivers... even after forcing the install I try to launch it but I only see the splash screen, actual software doesn’t launch. Not a big deal but can’t set the keyboard color scheme without predator sense. Besides those issues the laptop is really nice",0
(Llego todo bien): llego todo bien en su empaque,0
it was really easy to set up and was easy to get loaded and going with the programs we generally use.,0
"(Great chromebook. Fast, efficient and great for a full size Chromebook): Great chromebook. Fast, efficient and great for a full size laptop",0
"(Good for the price): The charger port is a little loose so I charge it at night. Battery lasts a long time once charged. Usually have about 6 tabs open at once and it runs just fine. I use it for basic internet searching, paper writing, etc.",0
"(Excelente equipo): Muy buen equipo, cumple las expectativas.",0
"(Light, powerful and awesome): The touch screen is very responsive, and the stylus is great. I love how quickly it boots up, and that it lasts all day on 1 charge",0
"(it keeps crashing): i wanted to use this laptop for watching things such as netflix and youtube, but every time i do that, it crashes. a screen pops up saying "" Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage."" It happens repeatedly and its very annoying. im hoping to return this laptop soon :(((",0
(ITs TOP KNOTCH!!): It was a great buy and will HIGHLY RECOMMEND for others.,0
The RGB on presets alone on the keyboard are impressive,0
(Some things about the computer): Have no issue with this computer so far everything’s been fine I’ve gotten a couple games on steam and Warzone and some other and it runs perfectly fine I’m just using this lap just so I can move around with it and not play on my desktop PC sitting all day but other than that it’s good if you wanna start on some gaming and stuff only thing I don’t like is the battery life that much but it’s something you can deal with,0
(It randomly turns off frequently.): We’ve had the computer for about a month and it has randomly shut off at least 10 times during that time.,0
"(Loaded! Desktop performance in a laptop!): I’m a desktop computer guy. I’ve had a few laptops in the past and have been pretty underwhelmed by them. In general, in my experience, dollar for dollar desktops outperform laptops.I have to say that this HP Envy is a very welcome exception to that rule. The CPU is an Intel Core i7, as good as anything in a desktop. With 12 gigs of RAM it blazes through apps, and has a terabyte of storage. On top of all that, it has an optical drive, a major plus and something that’s becoming ever more rare in laptops. That means that in addition to being able to write to an external medium (for archiving or whatever) you can watch videos, as well as game.Speaking of gaming, it has a pretty impressive graphics card, too. Not enough for a full-blown gaming experience for those games with very high graphics needs, but still pretty impressive.The touch screen is a very large 17 inches. Of course, this makes the entire unit somewhat bigger than what’s becoming the “standard” small size for laptops, but again, it’s a tradeoff. Great visuals versus small size.Set up was very easy, and it was up and running in no time. To this point I haven’t experienced any of the problems mentioned in the other two reviews that are up at this time, nor any others.Loaded with features, very fast and capable, I’m beyond impressed with this laptop. A very solid 5 stars.",0
(Not recommended for gaming!): CPU and GPU keeps running hot. Gotten Blue Screen of Death after 2nd day playing on line. Would not recommend for a real gamer. I am not and just started playing with my husband. Have cooling pad and all. Just mailed it back to Amazon today!,0
"(Does Not Have a Backlit Keyboard): The product heading is: ""ASUS VivoBook 15 Thin and Light Laptop, 15.6” FHD Display, Intel i3-1005G1 CPU, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, Backlit Keyboard, Fingerprint, Windows 10 Home in S Mode, Slate Gray, F512JA-AS34"" yet the keyboard in not backlit and the F7 key is blank. Very disappointing. I would have purchased a different model is the write-up had been accurate.",0
(DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM OR FROM THIS SELLER): This laptop will not stay connected to the internet. How am I supposed to use if it’s constantly disconnecting.,0
"(Better off gaming on a used smartphone): The device thermal throttles 5 minutes into playing light games. No amount of googling can fix this and the warranty with asus is short and terrible. ASUS' customer service is very limited and resorts to mailing your computer in if plan A (bios reset) doesen't work.The fans are ramped up constantly due to unstable power usage or who know what.What we have here, is a loud, 20fps, crappy track padded computer. The point of switching to windows was to get a bit more for my money as opposed to picking up a MacBook pro, but your money is all wasted by this computer's failure to regulate its temperatures and workload.You're better off gaming on a used smartphone.",0
(Perfect for my needs!): This is my favorite laptop ever. The battery life is excellent. I like the keyboard and despite seeing many reviews with complaints about the trackpad I have no such complaints. The ports available are great. The screen is not the brightest (bonus for battery life) but I like the panel. Great everday workhorse! I wouldn't recommend for mostly media consumption.,0
(Don’t buy): Flaw in screen,0
VERY HARD TO OPEN AND START.,0
"(Great): Bought to play online game. Start up very fast and screen quality is excellent. Overall, this is a good computer.",0
"(Amazing Laptop for the price, I would say best Price/Specs ratio): This machine is amazing! Really fast, works very well for gaming as well as day-to-day tasks! Only downturn is the keyboard, it really stinks! REALLY, big time, if you are used to good keyboards, I would not recommend this computer. If you can move past that, then this laptop is for you. It doesn't bother me that much since I use a second screen with a USB-HUB for a mechanical keyboard, but could be annoying for some people.Besides that, I would also recommend upgrading the RAM to 16 gb minimum as well as getting a SSD to mount in this machine, it really bring a great machine to become fenomenal!",0
"(This laptop is a workhorse): This laptop is a workhorse. I cannot believe how fast it is. It does not matter whether playing video games, hard core streaming, compiling code, or just running through emails. The display is crisp and even the built in speakers are surprising. To have all this horsepower it is extraordinarily thin and lightweight without feeling brittle. The only thing that I would like is for the touch pad to be moved to the left just a tiny bit and be centered under the space bar. This does not come into play very often though as I use a mouse when I have a lot of work to do. I have not turned my desk top on since I got this computer.",0
"(I know Chrome OS and this is a good one, so far. Android apps available as off Nov 15, 2017): I bought this model elsewhere for $169.99 and I'm very happy with it after one day. I have an Asus Chromebook with a Core i3 and 6 GB of RAM along with an HP Chromebook 14 with a quad core Nvidia but with only 2GB of RAM. This model has 4 GB and a low end dual core Celeron, which is fine because I want the Android apps that will come with it. So far, I'm happy with the speed and performance of it. Can't beat the price.Update: 6/17/2017: Android apps is currently in the Beta channel for this model.Update: Android apps came on in ""Stable channel"" on 11/15/2017. It works great so far. It's easy to go from Chrome OS browser to Android apps and back again. Very happy with it.",0
"(I am not a happy camper.): Besides the screen flickering, this is not a touch screen! Sending it back.",0
"(Tough laptops): Excellent laptop. It has enough ports and it is very tough. I use for programming, some video editing with after effects and Adobe premiere, and even some light gaming.",0
"(Apple has done it again! LOVE IT!!!!): The MacBook Air is an amazing machine! I absolutely love it!!! I only wish that it had more ports on it. Not a huge deal because I bought a hub for more ports, but would have been nice to see more ports on this thing. Other than that, I love how responsive it is, and I love the picture quality! Also, the battery life on this thing is unreal!!! I have left it off the charger for well over a week and have not needed to charge it. It is amazing!!!",0
(Laptop): I like that its light and good on battery,0
"(Great product.): I love this thing! It is great and does everything I need it to do.I think what people forget or don't understand is that this is a Chromebook. It is limited in what it is capable of and is not the same as a full laptop. Please understand that before you buy it or I am sure you will be disappointed. I use it for my writing, watching videos, browsing social media, and occasionally chatting with friends. I have other computers that can do any heavy lifting that this can't. Having said all that I am very happy with this and would highly recommend it and would make the purchase again.",0
"(Very Good For The Money): I think this is a great deal for the money and specs. The CPU is good, better than some laptops in the same price bracket, and with enough RAM to be a good experience. The 3050 mobile version is not even as good as an RX 580 though, thats the only disappointment to me. The 3050 just isn't very good. Otherwise this laptop is VERY well balanced for the money when compared to the competition, but its not really a gaming laptop. The GPU just isn't very good while everything else is quite good.",0
(Stay way.): The product had many issues. Main issue was screen flickering. I even sent it to Lenovo for repairs but they sent it back to me without even repairing it. Thankfully Amazon was kind enough to let me return it.,0
(Great investment): This is exactly what my daughter needed for school and streaming videos,0
"(Some Issues Already): I've had this laptop for about 2 weeks now and overall it works ok so far, although I've noticed a couple of issues. For context, I haven't played a single game on the laptop yet and most of the time has been spent on web browser or using 1 or 2 engineering software (they aren't super intensive).I expected the computer to be more responsive than it currently is. For instance, I turned off the Bluetooth to play audio from my speakers and it took about 40s for it to start working (drivers fully updated). Once or twice it has frozen / lagged for a bit although not often. Battery is only about 3 hours currently (it drains a lot of juice, but that's expected for a gaming laptop). The worst issue of all so far that has me really worried is with the trackpad. Very often now it has wandered where it wants to and been unresponsive for several seconds. It starts doing a dance randomly through the screen and I'm not sure what's happening. Overall, you can tell the trackpad is on the cheap side. There also isn't any liquid / food oils on the touch pad so I am unsure why it does this.",0
"(Questionable quality, unquestionably bad customer support): Keyboard came defective and completely stopped working shortly thereafter. The MSI recommended troubleshooting failed, and then they recommended a bootstick (which I had to pay for), to fix the problem. Ordered the bootstick, but they waited a full day to actually ship it even though I paid for expedited shipping.And this was to replace the first laptop I purchased from them. In that laptop, the power supply failed 2 months out of warranty (a little over a year after purchase).DO NOT BUY MSI. They don't stand by their products, and they have no interest in actually helping their customers.",0
"(Value for Money! Very nice design): Received my laptop today, it was packed very good and secure. I was so excited to get it up. Start up time was a bit lengthy but once set up was completed, everything is moving swiftly. Love the look/design. It is slim with a professional design. Love the touch screen feature! I haven't gotten to assess the battery life properly as i just got it but so far so good.",0
(Buen producto): Buena compra y buen producto,0
"(Great Laptop for basic things): I would recommend this laptop for any buyers just looking for a very basic laptop. It is very quick to boot up so no wait time to get started on things like paying bills, surfing the net or checking emails. This would be a great laptop for an older adult or student who just needs one for the essential things because it is a very easy-to-use system. Also love the fact that is has so many port types (hdmi, SD Card Slot, 2 USB, and even an ethernet port for those every now and then moments) - no special adapters needed :)!!!",0
(Don't get it for Zoom or videoconferencing): It has poor connectivity with WiFi. Zoom barely works - so laggy and glitchy. It's not my internet as other devices run smoothly. It was under 200 bucks so I guess this is what I get.,0
(great product): loved all',0
(Hardware problem within 3 months of use.): Screen has become unstable - breakups and flashes every few seconds.International warranty only valid in country of purchase which is not helpful.Would not buy another one again.,0
(Perfect): Perfect. Thank you so much,0
(Operating system very fast.): Nothing to dislike. Great product so far.,0
I needed something a bit more powerful though,0
"(Only works with intermet): Nice display device for internet. Very limited on board storage. Just an expensive filler for backpack without internet. No windows based, can't transfer photos without more software.",0
(Get this if you love shooters like Destiny 2): By far my best Amazon purchase I’ve made,0
"(Priced a bit high for what it is.): So first, I am not taking the paid by MSI review thing. Yes most reviews here prob did.Some things other reviewers have said that I will echo. Yes the keyboard is REALLY flimsy, I didn't think it would be that bad but holy crap it is. Yes the fans are loud and high pitched. And no the laptop does not stay cool. Even under basic tasks it gets pretty hot to the touch.Other things that people should note if they are looking to buy this, first the default install is crap. It is slow and very sluggish for an i7 with 32GB of ram it should not be that slow. Seriously MSI what are you doing? If you wipe and do a fresh install(be warned you will need to have the wifi drivers predownload) it is a very nice experience.The real deal breaker for me and why I returned it, the USB ports are REALLY shallow. I keep a yubikey nano plugged in at all times, and if you look at the image you can see how flush it sits in the MBP but on the GS65 is sticks out way to much that I would be scared when putting it in a bag I would catch the yubikey and rip out the usb port or at least severely damage it.",0
"Unboxing and setup were mostly clean, and the system was largely free of bloatware.",0
"(It stopped working after 1.3 years.): Looks like something is made with this model to expire after warranty. Very bad, very expensive and not good investment. Never back to asus!",0
(Best Purchase Ever 😍): This was a great Cyber Monday purchase. Works great and delivered on time.,0
(Not clear what you get): The product description is very unclear. In one place it says 0 disk storage and another refers to 7200 RPM Drive (Hard Disk??). What is offered in terms of storage? Reluctant to buy without clear information.,0
(It's fast): It's everthing we thought it would be,0
(Decent value): Nice computer,0
"(Good budget Laptop): Disclosure: I immediately upgraded this with an additional 1TB SSD that is quite a bit faster than the one installed and I also swapped out the 8GB of RAM for 32GB. Which ran me an additional $230. I also have it hooked up to a 1440p 32"" Lenovo monitor, a pair of Creative pebble speakers, and a Steel Series gaming keyboard, so my experience with this laptop is quite a bit better than stock.Overall I am fairly happy with the performance of the laptop and its a pretty good one for the price. The screen and speakers aren't anything to write home about but they do the job. Keyboard is usable. Battery life is serviceable. Fair bit of bloat ware but I guess that is to be expected. Fans do get quite loud even when you aren't playing games and just doing installs. Stock SSD seems a tad on the slow side but its replaceable. What's not and the sticking point for me is the GPU. Its a GTX1650 4GB and while its ""fine"" it will not do ray tracing and 4k is going to be a struggle. Its done fine on just about everything I've thrown at it in 1440p, but I wasn't really looking for status quo in a new laptop and will likely return it for the next model up that has the RTX2060 GPU.",0
"(Great Web Browsing Machine): I needed a simple machine for wimple web browsing, nothing more. This one fills the bill. I'm sure it can do much more, but it does exactly what I need it to do, and the price was right. If you need a simple machine for simple tasks, this is a great choice. Keep in mind, it doesn't run Windows based applications. It also doesn't insist on doing updates everytime you want to get some work done :-)",0
(Blue screen fail.): The computer was cheap and Microsoft 10 had a critical blue screen issue that could not be fixed easily. Sent it back after using it 3 times.,0
"(Love the laptop): I purchased this laptop for gaming mainly but so I could do other things with it my only real problem with this laptop is that I have to sign up for Microsoft 365 to be able to use apps like Word, Power point, or even Excel. Other than that it's definitely better than my old Chromebook for sure.",0
"(Buyer Beware): This is a good laptop for kids who dont need to download applications, I had to return mine the because it comes with something called ""S mode"" so i couldnt do my work on it because i was unable to download the things i need!",0
(This is a very good laptop): I bought this laptop for my wife she said she really loves it.Everything works very well no problems.Thank You,0
Extremely powerful and aesthetic computer that boasts the newest 144hz screen which is incredible when gaming.,0
"(Awesome machine, Wyckoff large tablet with a keyboard): Awesome machine, Wyckoff large tablet with a keyboard. Does everything I needed to do and being a SSD boot up is normally 3 seconds. Awesome product",0
(battery charger is garbage): 2nd time in 6 months it stops working. And battery life is utter garbage. Laptop is great but battery power is absolute crap.,0
"(the worst laptop ever): i bought the laptop on 12/22. set it up on 12/28. returning it same day. Literally the worst laptop ever. stick to name brands, its worth the extra money. processor is super slow, required 10+ window updates upon 1st set up which took more than 4 hours. 3 calls to tech support (very helpful btw). don't buy it.",0
"(Great for Moderate Gaming): I really enjoy this laptop, It's super quick. Loads into windows under 4 seconds.I added a ""Kingston Technology HyperX Impact 8GB 2666MHz DDR4 CL15 260-Pin SODIMM Laptop Memory (HX426S15IB2/8)"" ram module for making the Ram 16GB total, this will work best with the shared GPU memory.YOU WILL NEED MORE RAM FOR HEAVIER GAMESThe onboard GPU memory is shared with your ram when in gaming mode.I played space engineers, which requires around 5GB of VRAM for medium gameplay, it leaked into my actual ram, but with the hyperx upgrade there was only slight FPS drops but not enough to affect gameplay. Ram is important.I recommend windows 10 Pro 1909, don't use 2004 on this laptop will die really quick in Win 10 2004. Lasted about 3 hours under full load, whist 1909 lasted around 7 hours under full load, close to expected battery life.The Intel CPU Turbos to 3.98 Ghz while plugged in, if you set it that way.If you plan to install linux, the NVME will not be detected at boot time, to fix this, head to bios and on the first tab or second tab press ""CTRL"" + ""S"" to bring up a setting and change and disable intel optane firmware to use nvme in linux, as when you boot a non windows OS, the nvme will be placed into sleep mode.As for a extra nvme slot, i picked up ""Western Digital 250GB WD Blue SN550 NVMe Internal SSD - Gen3 x4 PCIe 8Gb/s, M.2 2280, 3D NAND, Up to 2,400 MB/s - WDS250G2B0C"" from many other users, as this will take full advantage of the laptops firmware and hardware. You can pick higher space storage, but as a light gamer, this was enough for me.As for the 2.5"" drive, i picked up a ""ST1000LM024 HN-m101Mbb"" It's a 1TB Mechanical Drive with decent write and read speeds for lighter games, and game storage. Granted it is slower, but for this laptop its perfect and I can get full R/W speeds that were advertised. If you notice, it's the same drive inside the XBox 1 - 1st Gen, so You can game on it as well, not as fast load times, but its fast enough to still enjoy a game.Besides the battery life, this is a really good laptop if you go out to a friends house for a night and do some moderate gaming like a LAN party, or a small road trip, or sitting out side for a few hours.I do not recommend taking this on a flight. Unless you get an extra battery.As of this message, I am using this as my main pc, and quite enjoy it, the Intel i5v9 is great and the GTX 1650 plays most games on Medium/High at 50/60fps.Also another note to stay on 1909, is that windows f--ked up the NVIDIA auto select method for Intel Graphics and GPU graphics, so some games will default to intel CPU instead of NVIDIA.Also, This laptop can play COD: Cold War at High settings with 48/55fps under heavy scenes and a perfect 60fps on normal fighting.",0
"(mother board dead under a year): Purchased 2 of this laptop for my teenage boys for Christmas, the mother board on the 1st one died at about 9 months and I never did get warranty help with it.

(Love it.): Great laptop for a great price. Fast. Worth it considering the gpu shortage.,0
(Defective): This was a great computer until it started losing internet every time I booted it up. I have to call HP support every day and have them troubleshoot things to get it working. I’ve begged for them to replace it but they always think they can fix it. I’m so annoyed and just want to throw this thing out the window,0

"(User interface complicated.): This product did not come with the list inherent on linking all applications to the Google assistant. The desktop is only referring to the little taskbar at the bottom to store apps. Good price if you don't know what you're doing, which even if you use a pixel phone the interface is different and a bit to overcome. Probably will have to watch some YouTube vids to get the hang of it.",0

"(Good laptop, useless keyboard!): Great laptop, great performance, nice features, everything is great except one thing, the keyboard is absolutely horrendous. The keys don't stick out very high which wouldn't be a problem if the keys were responsive but they are absolutely not, opposite from it. I've included a video showing what I mean. Some presses won't register and you have to press really hard for all presses to register. I find that very annoying. I don't know if it's the unit I got or if all of them have the same issue.",0

"(Slow, but probably good for movie-watching): We needed a cheap laptop to do Gmail and Google Docs only. We bought this in September 2019. The screen is large and bright, and the sound is outstanding, but there is a painful delay when interacting with Gmail and Google Docs, even if only one tab is open in Chrome. Compared to the Windows 7 laptop we bought for about $300 back in 2011, it boots quickly of course, but is noticeably slower once you are in Gmail. Some browser tweaking didn't make any noticeable improvement.",0

"(Good laptop, up until it breaks.): For what it is, this laptop is a pretty good and relatively cheap gaming laptop. However, I have had my laptop repaired once and die twice in the span of 3 months.I am literally waiting on getting it repaired again, and the last time it took them 3 weeks to repair it in the first place.Yes, I know things were delayed due to COVID, but that's still a long time without a functioning computer and I'm looking to go through that all over again because, for whatever reason, Acer is unwilling to give me a replacement and instead offered me a 2nd repair for a now returning problem.So effectively, my laptop has been unuseable for nearly a third of the time I've owned it and their customer service has been as basic and unhelpful as you can imagine.What a miserable time. Avoid if you can.Maybe I was unlucky and got a faulty computer out of the box, but I don't think I'd ever feel okay spending money on Acer ever again. I would definitely advise some caution to anyone reading this and still considering buying Acer.",0

It's been less than a year, and the battery life only lasts for two hours. Frankly, I was disappointed when I had to buy a different HDMI cord for this laptop. Also, whenever I plug my headset (usb) or mouse, the screen flickers.

The fonts on the opening screen and the ip address and tab lines were so tiny you need a magnifying glass. I spent 1 hour with Acer Techs and they were unable to correct. Same with Google. I did get a response on line and the correction to enlarge the fonts made the screen ""landscape"" meaning you had to center all views repeatedly.

"(Excellent Laptop for the Price): I kind of doubt there's a cheaper laptop on Amazon with this level of performance.The biggest con, and it's a con with all 3 of the HP laptops I've owned, is that either the charge port or the charger itself is crap. When it's plugged in I have to sometimes wiggle the charger or orient the charger in such a way that it actually charges the laptop. For the price, I can deal with it.",0
"(Just as advertised!): The computer arrived securely packaged. It looks and performs just as advertised. Although it doesn't have a touchscreen, it performs well otherwise.",0
"(The hardware is fine but the OS sucks): The problem was with the operating system, namely Chrome OS, which seems fine for many, probably those who grew up with Android phones. But for us old-school Microsoft folk it was like Greek, not nearly enough help, unintuitive (at least to us) with all sorts of unexplained symbols that did important things (the Greek!). Plus it wants to send everything to the cloud or Google Drive and with our rural snail’s pace internet connection, that would take FOREVER! So now we’ll try Windows 10 in S mode, which is supposed to make things easier while looking familiar, though, like Google or Apple, everything has to go through Microsoft, for apps, having to use Bing (bye-bye Chrome and Firefox). We’ll see…..(Interestingly you can opt out of the S mode but not opt back in, hmmmmm)",0

If I try to look at a movie, I'll see ma ybe fifteen minutes of the movie and then the computer will freeze up and I can't watch a thing. This laptop is always freezing up without any warning. I have to reboot the computer at least thirty times a day. If I'm online the computer will just kick me off the web site and then return to the start up screen. I've tried using the tools that come with the computer to maintain that everything is working correctly. What a joke. If you try to scan the computer it will scan about a minute and then freeze up or return to the start up screen. I definitely threw money away when I purchased this junk two months ago. If you have money to throw away then by all means purchase this computer. I used to respect the HP brand, but after buying this piece of junk, I'll never purchase anything with the HP name ever again.",0

"(Amazingly light and great screen size and sharpness): I have had a lot of laptops in my life, for which I have paid $1k to $10k. This approx $2k LG Gram 17” is a wonder of engineering and a true pleasure to use. It boots blazingly fast. The fingerprint reader is the best I have seen and it is nearly instant. The speed of the computer overall is fast (though I did immediately upgrade the RAM to 32GB, even though it seemed ok before without it), the screen is a delight, and the lightness of the weight is just phenomenal. It’s so light it is lighter than my last 13” ultraportable. Even the adapter is small and light. It beats everything else I have touched and looked at by a good measure. As a geek who loves tech I change laptop practically every few months and have tried dozens and dozens of them just in the past few years. The only constructive criticism I would have is a hope for a regular size keyboard, since there is room. But It’s a minor comment. I love everything else.",0
"(Nearly 0 processing power. Can't even handle a Zoom class with more than 4 people.): I bought this chromebook because I was looking for a small, lightweight laptop that I could take to class with me to do basic word processing and access online material. Unfortunately with the pandemic, most of my classes this semester are online and require the program Zoom to attend the classes. This chromebook HATES to run Zoom. I have had nothing but issue after issue with using video conferencing software. My microphone through Zoom works about 30% of the time and I constantly get an error that states something along the line of there is too many processes running in the background, even though nothing is running except Zoom. I also constantly get a ""your internet connection is unstable"" which is definitely is not. I have several, several devices in my home that run both directly wired and wireless through Wifi and none of them have never had this issue. I also have a very high end, expensive business Internet package.I would absolutely not recommend this device to anyone who wants to anything other than play solitaire. I've owned an off-brand tablet that I got for opening a bank account that worked better than this chromebook.",0
"(Ok now. But needed work to make usefully): Seem to be a good computer. I purchased this to run a CNC , but had problems down loading the needed programs. After taking to to a computer knowledgeable person (which I am not) they determined it was because of the Windows 10S. No where in the description does it say 10S. Luckily he was Adele to remove the S and all seems to be working fine now. There needs to be Full Disclosure on items. Stop hiding the truth.",0
"(DO NOT BUY THIS!!!): Do not purchase this laptop. It was awesome in the beginning and then out of nowhere it simply stopped working. This cost me way too much money for it to just quit working. It will not power on at all. Please do NOT waste your money on ASUS computers. My daughter’s gaming computer from Walmart was cheaper and operates much better. If I could give a zero, I would.",0
"(Good ultraportable with some limits): Acer ReviewTL; DR: This Acer laptop is slim, light and good-looking. The backlit keyboard is comfortable, screen crisp and trackpad responsive. The i7 processor and Iris Xe graphics are very capable, but severely hampered by totally inadequate heat management, leaving the user unable to take full advantage of them in demanding applications for long.Form FactorThis is a beautiful little laptop. The design is simple and straightforward, with silver coloring all over. It’s svelte; very thin and light. Opening the lid, the computer lifts up a bit in the back, settling on some rubberized feet on the lower lip of the monitor, creating some built-in keyboard elevation. The keyboard is comfortable. Layout is excellent, with no keys being oddly sized in a way that would throw off your touch typing. The trackpad is a little small, but does the job. Standard gestures are easily tracked without issue. Backlight shows through key labels nicely; it automatically shuts off after a minute of non-use, but can be changed to user preference.ScreenThe screen is small--this is an ultraportable laptop--but aspect ratio is comfortable. The screen is bright and clear, even when on light gaming duty or reading text. You also get a Thunderbolt and full-sized HDMI port which you can use to hook up to a full-sized monitor if you need a little more visual real estate.ConnectivityThe wifi speed for this laptop is outstanding. Connecting to a 5ghz network with good signal will get you some excellent download speeds (dependent on your provider’s data speeds, of course). I downloaded a 75 GB game in under 25 minutes over wifi. It’s pretty nice.PerformanceThis is a mixed bag. You’ve got a machine with an i7 processor and the Iris Xe graphics--these on their own have solid performance, even when it comes to playing a lot of modern games on respectable (if not ultra) settings or doing high-def video editing. On the other hand, you’ve only got 8 GB of RAM and the limited heat management that comes with an ultra-portable. What you end up with is a total package that can’t take advantage of its full potential.As a stress test, I ran World of Warcraft: Shadowlands at max settings to see what kind of frame rate I could get. It was actually playable at 25 fps… not fantastic, but for an integrated GPU, not bad. I played for about 15 minutes before the laptop froze up. The fan never sped up as fast as it should have to manage the heat, and with only one small vent toward the top of the keyboard, it folded under the load. I quit out and the computer cooled down quickly. I was able to resume play on medium settings (4 custom on the slider) and kept that up for about 40 minutes without issue, but it was disappointing to know that the potential was there, just out of reach.Granted, this isn’t a gaming rig. But, the description does indicate use for things like video editing and demanding business applications. There may be some walls you’ll hit in terms of performance in some situations that the CPU should be capable of.",0
"(Disappointed): After less than three (3) months, the screen went black although the power light is on.I’ve tried troubleshooting but cannot seem to find resolve. Guess I’ll have to purchase a new one as I know it won’t be replaced because I didn’t purchase the warranty.",0
(Dependable): Nice book. Good value,0
"(Just over 3 months, dead battery?): I only used this chromebook for about a month. It didn't work well with Zoom meetings so I used it for reading ebooks and went back to my old Acer for zoom mtgs. I use my kindle fire for ebooks so I left the Chromebook 15 in the closet for 2 months, took it out and it wouldn't charge. Got a new charger, no luck. I missed my return window so I couldn't return it. Called Acer, gave up after 30 minutes.",0
"(They aren't kidding when they say it's slim and sleek!): They aren't kidding when they say this is thin and sleek. It has such a slim profile that it's sized like a small folder, so it's incredibly portable and easy to work on when traveling. The 13 inch screen in perfect when you need something bigger and easier to work/type on than a tablet, but don't want anything too big or bulky.Comparing this to my Acer Spin 5, the actual screen viewable area seems to be larger. The bezel frame around the Acer is wider, so the super slim frame around the Dell offers even more screen viewing real-estate.The touch screen is very responsive and I'm pleased they included a backlit keyboard. My Acer that's similar in style and design doesn't have a backlight, which has been an issue since the start. I never thought it would be a big deal, until I didn't have the backlight and I realized how difficult it can be to type in low light with black keys that have nothing to light them up.One thing that's very different between the systems is how few ports this computer has. This Dell has just a single type C port and an SD card slot. My Acer Spin 5 has two type C ports, an HDMI, two USB ports and an SD slot. However my Acer is a tiny bit thicker than this Dell. So you sacrifice additional ?ports for having an ultra slim design. Something to keep in mind when deciding on a computer, since what you connect to this Dell will be limited.The speakers sound quite good for such a small machine. The screen is bright and the colors are rich. The included graphics card has been able to run everything smoothly for me so far. While I don't game with this Dell, I do some video editing with it and the software has worked well without any lagging or crashing. About the only thing I could think of changing would be the inclusion of a single USB port, for use with some small wireless travel mice.",0
"(Awesome Portable Workstation): Finally an affordable Laptop that is able to handle my work programs, not tied to a desk anymore.",0
"Looks great and does not have an overly aggressive ""gaming laptop"" design aside from the MSI logo.",0
"(An okay deal, needs upgrades in my opinion): At the time I purchased this, it was a good deal, and I won't change my star rating. However, if you are purchasing a laptop today, compare this to ones of newer hardware makes and you'll find even other ASUS products like the TUF line in a very similar price bracket with better hardware. I do have it on some authority that even these other products, and those produced by some other companies, still ship in single channel mode so plan accordingly if you want to really get the bang for the buck you're looking for. I will update again when upgrades are complete.My intention in buying this laptop was to get a steep upgrade over my ancient ASUS SonicMaster, but without breaking $2000. I have had it little more over a week, and all seems good. Graphics are excellent, battery is understandably not great and in every setting capacity still LOSES charge while plugged in and gaming, but I've had much worse. (See updates). I have found that turning off hardware acceleration for many programs actually lends itself to better overall performance, especially given that few programs even NEED this feature to operate efficiently. I also saw a reduction in temperatures by simply raising the rear of the base by even just a few millimeters to allow space for air beneath the laptop. The form factor works against you more than other more airflow oriented cases.UPDATE: The included bloatware is irritating, as with any company. Armoury Crate, an in-your-face advertisement that also KIND OF controls the RGB (though the lights completely blanking out or features not working at all is common), though can be borderline worthless unless you install the separate but functionally similar Aura Sync program (which often conflicts with Armoury Crate it seems). Not only is Armoury Crate just another way to slip ads into your general computer experience, there are at least 3 other apps that serve to also do that, all from ASUS, which is disappointing from a company I've always loved and supported. RGB lighting is irritatingly dim and brightness settings are not readily easy to find, but it hardly matters as Armoury Crate and Aura Sync seem to occasionally randomly disable the RGB anyway with my settings disappearing. So don't buy ASUS on the promise of RGB.The camera, though decent enough, is planted just above your F12 key, meaning to actually have it look at your face, you will need to bend the monitor back 30-45 degrees away from you. Ridiculous, for a feature that even the cheapest, worst laptops get right. I don't use laptop cameras very often, but this is absolutely stupid placement. Otherwise, at typical viewing angle, the camera is half-full of your F12 key. On the plus side at least the RGB is nice on camera when it works.UPDATE 2: I have made particular note of the fact that this laptop SHIPS with only one RAM stick. This means that you will operate in the functionally inferior single-channel mode, which for a top-down quality product maker like ASUS is frankly bothersome. If you're getting this for gaming, you only really need 16gb. I still have games that top out at 8gb usage. But, to get this machine to actually operate at its capacity, the smart thing to do is buy a whole other 16gb RAM stick, or sell the included stick and buy 2x8gb sticks if gaming is all you're doing and you don't wanna spend enough to buy a lower quality laptop just in upgrading this one. I know this might sound like you end up with the same amount of RAM but computers perform better with dual-channel (2 sticks), demonstrably so, though I've yet to see the impact on this computer as of now I'm still waiting for the new stick to arrive.On that same note, I am personally replacing the m.2 drive for a faster, higher capacity Samsung model. On inspection, this computer has fantastic expansion capabilities, but the cooling still concerns me. On initial setup with the stock SSD, I attempted to move my Windows file directories like Pictures, Documents, Music, etc. to the larger HDD which is my normal method to save SSD space and put bulk storage on the HDD, and I encountered strange complications where the directory wouldn't change and duplicate directories appeared elsewhere. I've not yet discovered how or why this occurred. I believe it's a Windows issue, however I've never experienced this on any other machine of any other configuration.BIOS is another point of contention for me, as I've yet to find the standard settings I usually see in other ASUS products. Either they've been hidden, moved, or entirely removed. I'm referring to settings for the processor and RAM specifically. It did, however, ship with the latest BIOS revision and since owning it I have not seen another update to the BIOS posted in the manufacturer website. Granted they probably don't want people trying to overclock this machine, but if these settings truly are gone it also makes undervolting and RAM management harder.The touchpad is functional, but I hate touchpads so I don't have a lot to say. Nicer than most. The display panel is alright, though color balance always feels off somewhat. The keyboard is a little awkward for me to adjust to, however the keys are very responsive and the frame is very sturdy, meaning no flex in the keyboard with pressure applied. A+ keyboard.",0

"(The great little laptop): I've now had this laptop for a month, and I am delighted with my purchase. There's a lot about this laptop to love too. It is lightweight, which makes it very portable, so you don't mind taking it with you. The solid aluminum body is strong, although it can flex if you're not careful. The fingerprint scanner works wonderfully. While the specs say the battery can last UP TO 12-hours, my experience has been that it lasts closer to 10-hours, which still isn't bad. The 8th generation i5-8250U processor, 256GB SSD drive, and 8GB of RAM make for a fast user experience. I've had tons of tabs in Google Chrome open, multiple MS Word documents open while streaming music with no problems.While a great laptop, there are a few things I don't like about it. First would have to be the location of the power button, which is next to the 'delete' key. On multiple occasions, I've hit the power button while editing a document. I changed to the power button to put the laptop to sleep when you hit the power button, so I didn't lose any work, but it is still frustrating. My only other complaint so far is that neither the RAM nor the SSD drive is upgradeable. Using an external SSD drive solves the storage issue with negligible performance differences, so that issue has a workaround. As for the 8GB of RAM...",0
"(My eyes get tired easily, but overall good): Refresh rate is low or perhaps the monitor itself, it's low quality. Otherwise, it's a very good Chromebook.",0
"(BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST!!!!!): Best computer i have ever had, very good job Apple. Comparing to many brands HP, Acer, Dell, etc this is a rocket based on price, speed, image, performance, everything. just the best buy you can ever have, dont doubt it for a second.Btw i rarely do reviews for stuff i buy but it deserves it, could not be happier!",0
"(Hinge mount failure at laptop top cover plastic lid mount point during light use): XE521QAB has a ""common issue"" with this unit according to a Samsung Authorized Service Center. Hinge breaks away from plastic top cover mount. Official Samsung chat (website where you are logged in with your warranty info) will refer you to the Authorized Service Center who will tell you there is a ""Free of Charge"" repair, however Samsung must provide you with a Shipping label that has a Service Ticket Number included, in order for the repair to be covered under the One-Time Coverage. If you are six months out of warranty forget it. Not covered. I am not the first person to take time and energy to type this type of review. Look it up on leading big box stores website comments for this product. In my case I had bought two of the exact same models approximately a month apart, for personal use. I bought one and my spouse liked it, so we bought another since our existing Chromebooks were going End of Life soon. Here is the deal: The left hinge mount broke away from the top cover mount point (see photos engineers) approximately three weeks from each other. Personal use Chromebook, light usage by adults, broken hinges. Samsung USA chat support = no help. Referred me to Authorized Service Center and they will not talk to you unless you have a service ticket from Samsung. Constant loop. Two laptops, about $1,000 USD, useless. Warranty is six months expired with two years left on Google software support updates on Samsung Chromebook Plus V2. Still being sold new. Unacceptable. Do not buy. Chat support would not escalate to manager or executive complaint. #samsung unacceptable product fail. #Google hope you are monitoring your brand partners.",0
"(So far, so good.): I have had the laptop for a month and have not had any issues. The unit showed very little signs of wear which is nice. For the specs, it is well worth the price. I like how the keys light up, it has been nice when in a dark room. It is plenty fast as well.",0
"(A solid laptop for school): I bought this laptop on the recommendation of the wirecutter. It has not disappointed, even though it has made compromises across the board to save money and weight. The screen is more than adequate for viewing indoors and a little outdoors with indirect light. The track pad was a little scattered at first, but once I disabled 3 and 4 finger gestures it has worked smoothly. The fingerprint reader works flawlessly. Battery life is around 6-7 hours with moderate use. The chassis is strong and feels very premium with metal edges and a glass finish to the track pad. In terms of gaming, I would not expect too much. I have installed steam and actually streamed the screen from my other machine. The computer gets hot fast, but could probably handle gaming on some lower settings. But that's not why you buy this machine. It's light, it's solid and for all day research and portability, this machine is fantastic.",0

"(Very good for the price): I've been using this computer (Lenovo Yoga 720 2-in1 12.5"", Intel Core i5-7200U, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD Windows 10) for over a month. I bought it after my old laptop died in less than three years and this was the most affordable option available on Amazon and other websites with the kind of specs I wanted. I must say it exceeded my expectations and I'm really happy with it so far. It has a compact design that looks and feels sleek and sturdy at the same time. I find the display really bright and clear, but I don't work with photo apps etc. Touchscreen works well, though I've never tried it with a stylus yet. Tablet mode works well too and I love the practicality of it. Battery life is okay for a computer in this price range with this kind of processor, in my experience it goes from 100% to about 30% in 4,5-5 hours with constant moderate use, 50% screen brightness and WiFi on. The charger is really light so it's not a problem carrying it with me. No overheating--it doesn't heat up very often and it never gets uncomfortably hot. Speakers aren't very good, though, and the fingerprint reader isn't super fast, in my experience it usually takes 2-3 tries for it to read my finger.",0
"(Excellent Chromebook!): Its perfect for a school going kid who wants to do the homework and stuff! the power button is a little confusing in terms of turning it On, however overall its a good product! Definitely recommend it!",0
"(Great Chromebook for the price once WIFI was repaired): The Chromebook was a fantastic buy for us - the primary purpose was as school computer for the kids (we do use it for use as a secondary computer as well). Our kids already use Chromebooks at their school so it was very easy getting their accounts set up and then accessing their school folders. I'm glad we purchased the 14"" as having the larger display was especially helpful when there is more than one person huddling around the machine. The Chromebook's processor and RAM appears more than enough to handle the streaming video and multiple applications open at once.The only reason for 4 stars is that the unit we purchased had a failing WIFI part. It exhibited it itself sporadically as our WIFI connection would seem to drop at random - this started from the time we first started using the unit. By the time we realized that the behavior wasn't normal, we couldn't return it to Amazon (past 30 days) so we shipped it to HP for repair under warranty. My disappointment was that HP didn't cover the shipping charges (about $16) for us to send the unit to them and that Amazon sold us a defective product from the beginning as a Warehouse Deal. The unit condition was marked ""Used - Very Good - Item is in original packaging, but packaging has damage.""",0
(Great except for sound): Only real con is for speaker quality. Other than that I'm happy with my purchase,0
(Crap): Love chrombooks but this one is crappie. Picture shaddy. Can not do a lot with it simple task only. If you are experienced . Don't waste your money. For a small child learning.,0
(Waste of money): One of the most horrible purchases I did..I bought it a year back which broke in 11moths then I bought the same again which didn’tLasted for few week and start showing the same black screen like previous one,0
"(It Runs HOTTT!!!): Purchased the Nitro 5 in May 2021... And have noticed while gaming, that it runs at or above 95C with a cooling pad... Even with the fans cranked to the Max in NitroSense!!! 95C is way to hot, and not normal!!! Running at 95C would no doubt had lead to premature failure of the CPU and GPU!!!This is a well known fact, yet unaddressed issue of the ACER Nitro and it is well noted and documented in Acer forums as well as YouTube and other sources, including reviews on this page... With that being said, I purchased Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut and cleaned off the existing OEM applied thermal paste, and applied the Kryonaut on the CPU and GPU as well as a little on the CPU/GPU cooler...(A DIY video is available on youtube) I then also changed the power plan in NitroSense to Power Saver... To my amazement, I am now gaming stable at 60C and under normal work loads I average about 40C to 45C...Hope this helps",0
(Acer laptop): Nice sleek style slim not too heavy. I use for any work that I have to do that I can’t use my iPad,0
The keyboard is feels responsive and amazing to type on.,0
(Five Stars): just what I wanted,0
(Was broken on arrival): Out of the box it was wasn’t working well. After a day I was able to set it up and got it running but it ran slow and the screen froze multiple times. The next day when I was turning it on it said that auto repair had failed and the drive had to be wiped clean. I got it when it was on sale and I like the model but now I’m going to have to pay more money for the same product. I love having a 1000 dollar paper weight.,0
(Trash): This thing can barely load a webpage let alone watch a video. Half the time it just keeps restarting. I wouldn't buy this. If I wasn't deployed to Afghanistan I would return this. I'm pissed.,0
"(Tiger Lake chip): Very nice laptop at this price point ($500). No back light of course, also no User Manual as far as I can tell. Would buy it again.",0
It also has bad backlight bleeding.,0
"(the screens suck. I wish I would not have bought this ...): so many damn fingerprints on this thing, and it's weird because they don't come off. Also, the screens suck. I wish I would not have bought this honestly.",0
(Bundles r sometimes cheaper and literally save hundreds $$$): Awesome Laptop! Pretty good price for what you get! But!! Check all the bundle options!!!! they seem to be a lot cheaper than just buying the Laptop only.. for ex: Laptop only 1500$ .. if you buy the bundle package which comes with Laptop and a mouse pad its 1180$!??! literally hundreds$$ cheaper and you get something else too.. when i bought this a few months back the bundles were actually more $$ which made sense.. but now you can get the backpack too and save money,0
"(Good luck!): It wasn't the right computer for my academic and professional needs. So, I had to return it.Good luck!",0
"(From a casual user): I've always had about 600$ Toshiba's so this is my first laptop that was more than $1,000.I'm used to having a SATA SSD so casual usage isn't noticeably faster.Boot times and coming back from sleep actually seems to take longer I assume because this has windows 10 home and not pro which lets you disable the login screen.Purchased this at $1,299 after buying an Acer Predator Helios that arrived with screen bleed on first boot. Thought it might resolve itself with a windows update and did not so I returned it.The keyboard is a little bit more cramped and will take some getting used to but is super customizable.I'd like for the shift/fn keys to be backlit as well i.e. volume up/down and symbols.Most people seem to have one big gripe with the system and mine is the trackpad. Generic drivers, unknown manufacturer so I can't find a way to get momentum or inertia into use.The display is nice, passes the one finger test, doesn't wobble any more than other laptops I've had.I Haven't used it on battery yet, at least not for any stretch of time.Does not have a mux switch, uses some NVidia thing to manage GPU.6GB Video card according to DirectX.The camera is at the bottom of the screen so if you place it low, you get a low angle.I haven't had issues with the AORUS control center app. Seems to work just fine.8/27/22 Update: Aorus control center app is a nightmare to get working.Doesn't get any louder than my old Toshiba with casual use.Doesn't get noticeably warm with casual usage.The bird on the back of the screen does light up white when on.My favorite part so far is that the Wifi on this system seems to be so much faster than my Toshiba. Imgur switches posts really fast. Followed by the screen.Pictures:2nd SSD Slot, components, RAM, motherboard overall, and lastly the back of the laptop lid at night.Note: All the screws to remove the laptops underplate appear to be the same length, also was pretty easy to remove compared to some other laptops which really snap a lot when you open them.",0
(Received DEAD! NOT WORKING! STAY AWAY!): Unit came DOA. Complete waste of time. Stay away from this seller!,0
"(Great buy!): Got this as a gift for someome who'll use it strictly for email and YouTube, but honestly I'm shocked by how good this laptop is! Everything is very responsive and I love the setup. Great laptop!",0
"(Performance is really good): I was honestly scared to buy this pc just because of so many bad reviews. But I’m glad that I did because my pc arrived early, and in good quality, I’m in love. And yes it’s for gaming also because I played on it, and it performed well. If you’re thinking about getting this DO IT!!!!! Don’t listen to these people (most of them are trolls trying to make you not buy it)",0

"(Good overall laptop for multi-use): The laptop is about what you would expect, good cpu+gpu combo for an average gamer to play without any issues, I personally use this for machine learning and gaming, in both categories it's decent, the ports and upgradable memory is amazing, the only downside of the laptop is the gaming look.",0
(I've owned this for a few days now and I'm seriously impressed.): I will likely update this review or add another one in a few months time but my first impressions of the laptop are that it's very fast reliable and can run modern games in high settings. Of course any good gaming laptop owner will have a cooling pad which always helps performance. Before this laptop I owned a Lenovo l340 GTX 1650 which I loved. PS this laptop goes great with the Lenovo gaming mouse. Flawless cpmbination,0

(Great deal): Great deal,0
"(Good buy): Battery life is great, once you are not doing to much things. I had a glitch with the mouse the first day I bought it. But I have not seen it again from that day. It is portable, nice slim laptop, not heavy, work well so far. Camera quality is not so good, I think apple could have updated their camera quality, but it is fine anyways, usable. The speakers are loud and nice. Nice sound quality.",0
"(The Chromebook is very easy to use): The Chromebook is very easy to use. It comes with an easy to understand manual and how-to tour once you sign in. It links up to my devices easily and I can access and get notifications on my phone and computer for either. It runs on google docs and spread sheets which is not supported by most other sites. It does allow you to download your documents as a PDF or Microsoft document, which is supported by most sites that you might need to send them to. The Chromebook runs on a google platform which is not support by most hardware or online sites yet, but there are ways to download or install things through WiFi. Once you get used to some of the issues previously mentioned, the Chromebook is smooth to use and problems have been minimal. I do not regret my purchase, especially for the price this is a great buy.",0
(Amazing): Just what I was looking for,0
"(Great performance, reasonable price): After years of Alienware and Microsoft gaming laptops, this is my first run with a Lenovo and I dig it.Now I'm a former Microsoft employee, and have never been bothered by the chunkier aesthetic of PC's versus Macs. Will this win a beauty prize? No. But it's actually pretty compact for the power it's running, and the beveled case design clearly borrows from the Alienware cases of yore.The GTX1060 graphics card paired with the i7-8750H is a great combo, and one the proprietary screen showcases well. Backed by 16GB DDR4 of RAM, I was surprised that this never really got hot, even when playing a few hours of",0

"(Won’t turn on shortly after owning it for a year): I ordered this September 15, 2021. About a week ago (October 2022) it wouldn’t turn on anymore. I took it in to have it looked at and was told that a screw came loose and caused damage to the battery and then the motherboard. I am spending over $500 to get it all fixed. It’s ridiculous that I would have this issue a year in.",0
(Touch screen!): This little HP Pavilion works wonderful. The size is a touch smaller than my previous laptop and I actually like it much better. Very convenient and working great!,0
I find the screen opens and closes very smooth with the right amount of tension and the hinges are very sturdy,0
"(Did not work): I never could get it to turn on, even after 6 hours of charging. Sent it back, and haven't had the nerve to replace it yet.",0
(Worth the money): Love it,0
(Best Budget laptop 2019): Great Performance and Value.Upgradable memory and storage.AMD Ryzen 7 delivered great performance.,0
"(It's a Basic Chromebook): Update: This Chromebook has only proved to become more difficult. It now runs slower than previously stated and doesn't load all pages that our school uses. Oir basic tablet does a better job with load time and usability. The tracker pad has become spotty as well. We are now purchasing a new laptop and this is our expensive paper weight.I've had Chromebooks for years from Dell and Acer. This is my first Samsung purchase and was made during the shortages. I normally love Samsung so I was happy to score this after weeks of looking. However, I won't be purchasing another in the future from this brand. It does the job but it's clunky and doesn't seem to process quickly. This was purchased for my child for school but they find it very frustrating as it runs slow in load time (and it's not our network as I did consider that). It's basic - even for a Chromebook. The price is fair and it is easy to use. Ready to go right out of the box. If you don't need to use it for complex platforms, this might work for you. Now that Chromebooks and laptops are back in stock, I am already considering a different purchase.",0
"(Good laptop for the money): So far we have had no problems with it. We bought it for my daughter for college. If there are any hiccups come fall, I can resubmit.",0
(You get what you pay for): Great laptop if you are nostalgic for 1995,0
"(I think I got a lemon.): The first thing I noticed after turning it on for the first time were bright spots around the perimeter of the screen but mostly at the bottom. Not a big deal when on the web but when watching watching a movie and the background became dark, it was annoying. See the photo.I heard good things about Asus customer support which is one of the main reasons I got the computer. I let them know about the problem and they responded once asking if I dropped it to which I told them no and then never heard back even after a couple more attempts. At that point I initiated a return with Amazon who of course was great.The aluminum body is nice but I was not impressed with the build quality because it has a lot of flex to it. Overall it felt cheap.Anyway, glad a lot of people like the computer and I hate leaving anything less than a 5 star review but 3 stars in my case was more than generous.",0
"(Acer is not reliable): I bought two of these as well as two curved Acer gaming monitors. One laptop stopped turning on after about two months and I had to send it out to get repaired. Same exact thing with the two monitors I bought. When they turn on, they're ... Ok at best but nobody should spend 2k+ and have half of their products fail. Not great odds.",0

"(Constant BSoDs, ASUS RMA fixed nothing): I bought this laptop for my mother for Christmas 2018. Almost immediately after unboxing it, she started having issues with BSoDs (Blue Screen of Death). After months of me trying to troubleshoot, reinstalling Windows, and her saying ""it's okay I'll only use it for YouTube,"" I finally submitted an RMA with ASUS as it is still under warranty. We send the laptop back and after a week or two they send it to us with a factory image (which is all they did according to the notes) and... it immediately BSoDs the second it's actually in use. Nothing had been installed yet. We turned it on and Windows 10 kicked in its ""critical"" updates and the system BSoDed at that point. Clearly the service center didn't test much. Trying to get ahold of their service department again. Will update this review if the laptop is ever functional.",0
(I think it’s too fragile but otherwise you get what you paid for.): Product seemed ok at first but hinges are way too flimsy as first one broke within a few days and second also broke in a few weeks.,0

"(Screen flickering issues): Asus supports tries to help but nothing helps. This is the second laptop, first was replaced due to the same issue.....This one is going back as well. Screen flickers and drives me nuts. 2 starts because amazon support made returns easy. Product is nice looking and I wanted it to work but...…..what a waste of a month with these things.",0
The AMD graphics card and processor surprised me with great performance / speed,0
"(A great investment and cheaper alternative than what all else is out there): Meets and exceeds all of my expectations and requirements thus far; I usually play FPS, RTS and older games that don't require nearly what it has to offer.No issues with web browsing or watching videos in high quality, no jittering or stuttering with either gaming or browsing.Not using for VR currently, but might make that venture in the future.Keyboard and touchpad very responsive to tapping and touches, although I use a mouse, personally.Screen has a very good image quality to it. The GTX 1060 GPU is more than capable of more modern and demanding games and CPU pairs nicely with it.It does have an integrated GPU that is typically utilized for less-demanding tasks such as browsing the web/watching videos/document viewing or older style games, but you can set which GPU to use for which tasks or games etc (it is a laptop, so power and heat are always necessary to keep at a reasonable level)No complaints at all with this laptop. I would recommend to anyone on a budget that doesn't want to fight with building their own desktop or searching through a list of over a million different builds available for mobility and price.$1,000 for a rig that offers what the Helios 300 has in it is a very good deal.I've been 'playing' around with computers for the last 22-23 years, and have seen many good and bad builds, personally, as well as built both.--I am definitely NOT an expert and don't claim to be one, but I do know when something is a good value--",0

I do recommend this ACER Aspire 5 A515-56-702V laptop.",0
"(Worth the purchase): I had to purchase this laptop more out of haste because my previous laptop had complications, but I can say I'm actually quite happy with this one. It worked as expected for me and has a quick running speed for the applications I need as a university student. The smaller size makes it much lighter and easier to carry around in a smaller backpack, which is helpful when you have to walk around and switch to different parts of campus nearly every day. So far there hasn't been any major issues that would have made me give a lower rating, so sverall I'd say that the purchase was 100% worth it and I got the product as expected.",0

Large power brick, it's a compromise.Those we're all my cons right up front. It's a beast and the best RTX 2070 deal this year.Also, if you are worried about it getting warm or fan noise...you can undervolt the i7 with MSI. Google how to access the advanced BIOS and enable undervolting. Undervolted -.1 and underclocked the CPU to about 3.7 GHz, now it stays under 80degC while gaming and the fans cycle into low-med mode at most.No brainer if you are looking for a proper RTX 2070 gaming laptop this year.",0

"(Checks most of the boxes for the price): If you are in the market for I5 processor, 8gb ram, IPS screen and an SSD drive for under $600, the ACER Swift is one of only a few laptops on the list. The build and form factor are good, feels sturdy and compact. The screen lacks vibrancy (Not technical, i know) but is 1080P IPS. They keyboard feels stiff but does the trick. The track pad is a nice size, but feels cheap when you click it. The fingerprint reader is hit or miss. Overall, this is a great laptop for the price..you get the performance of the SSD, I5, SSD. Hands down a better build and feel than the dell inspiron...which i'm sure you may be considering if you are reading this review.",0

"(Works great!): This thing works like a charm. It was easy to set up, and games work very nicely. I get about 120+ on most games at max settings.There are only two things I don't like:1. There should be more memory. If you plan on getting lots of games or have a lot of files for work, it could fill somewhat fast. In some cases, I recommend an external hard drive.2. Not all games support RTX graphics. Not all games have been updated to support RTX graphics. I've seen it in a few games where it there would be about 20 less frames then normal. Not too much of a problem though, as developers will most likely add support soon enough. You just have to wait a little bit.",0

"(Not compatible with Microsoft programs and applications): My Windows laptop died and I didnt have time to research too thoroughly. Read the initial reviews, one which name-dropped my beloved long-stolen Acer netbook, and thought this sounded perfect: Portability, long battery, ""zippy"" one reviewer called it. And it was indeed zippy as it fired right up and my fingers adjusted to the soft, compact keyboard. Quickly I realized the problem: Google operating systems are not compatible with Microsoft Programs. yes, there are ""add ins"" like band-aids to access Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Access, etc but I need the ability to work offline and MS Office cannot be downloaded on Chromebook. Two years of projects on Microsoft programs and I couldnt work on them. Other programs I use frequently were incompatible with the OS too. Spent two hours online with tech support but in the end, I had to pack this adorable little netbook back up in the box and return it.",0
(Cool lab top !!! Love the red keyboard !): My son Loves this lab top ! Works great!,0
"(Great product, terrible service): Had the laptop for 6 weeks and loved it. Then while watching a video at about 75% volume, the speakers blow out. Audio quality is completely unusable now which definitely shouldn't be the case with a product this expensive.Contacted both Amazon and seller, neither wanted to take responsibility for a replacement. Now I'm stuck going overseas for work with a broken laptop. Very unsatisfied with customer service, would not recommend. If you're going to buy a computer, make sure you buy from a seller with some sort of guarantee.",0
"(Impressive Mahcine, Stylish tool): Hats off to the design engineering folks at ASUS. Thank you. Amazon pulled thru on the distribution and the shipment was not 'hit'.",0
"(love my acer laptop amd it is 15 inch screen.): love this laptop and it screen quality is great. clear, easy to type on the keyboard. easy use of an extended usb mouse. i don't like the touchpad personally preferred the usb mouse. screen is 25 inch so you can make the font larger and it doesn't take away from the view.",0
"(Buena laptop pero con deficiencias de batería y pantalla): Los componentes de la laptop son lo mejor relación costo beneficio pero alguno de sus componentes no son de buena calidad.La pantalla, el negro no es negro nítido (se ven fantasmas en blanco)La bateria aun sin jugar es un detalle importante, pero sabemos que posee una pantalla y características que no son para una pc de uso sin cargador.De resto no tengo quejas de momento de la laptop. Recomiendo su compra (evaluando siempre los precios del mercado)",0
(Exactly what I needed!): I LOVE this laptop. Works perfectly and a great price!,0
(It's good at what it does): It's good at what it does. Which is have a really long battery life and run chrome.It starts stuttering and crashing after about 20 tabs.Honestly don't try and game or anything that requires lots of power.,0
"(Love my laptop): I got this for gaming and it is super loud due to the fans. I even have it on a fan pad to help with cooling. It's only loud during gaming. Normal use is fine. But, it runs great! The battery will not last long if you're gaming, maybe 2 hours. So, keep it plugged in.",0
(small battery but good laptop): Very good laptop with bad battery (small battery)Fully battery give 1 hour with Microsoft word,0
"(so good. This is a functional laptop): So far, so good. This is a functional laptop, perfect for work and casual internet browsing. I bought this refurbished and haven't experienced any issues.",0
"(Amazing laptop): What can I say... Just a really great machine! Nothing I've thrown at this really phases it. I've played WZ 2.0 along with other games, while streaming Spotify off of the web and the only time it gets choppy is if the battery is getting low and I don't have it charging. The graphics on the laptop monitor, and the graphics on my curved Samsung external monitor are super crisp. I've played for a couple hours on this and it gets warm but not nearly as hot as I'd think it would. I bought an adjustable platform that has fans on it and it keeps it pretty cool. Cool design and the lights are fun. I bought this for play and work and I am amazed at how quick this is on work things as well. Its Click, wait for 1-2seconds and loaded. Really happy with this gaming laptop. Also gaming battery lasts for maybe 1.5hrs. But that's playing an intense WZ 2.0. Playing a game like Fallen Order I get closer to 3hrs. When not gaming the battery doesn't seem to move at all haha. Would recommend this laptop to everyone.",0
"(Looks as advertised! Great lap top): Fast shipping, thank you.",0
"(Overall a Solid Laptop for Students): I've had this computer for about two weeks and I am very pleased with it.A lot of the reviews I read said the fan was really noisy and distracting. I have only heard it be ""noisy"" a few times when I was running several softwares and even then you definitely wouldn't be able to hear it across the room.The touchpad has two-finger scrolling!!! My old laptop didn't have this feature and the touchpad was almost unusable but this touchpad is reactive and quickly and smoothly responds to any input. The touchpad settings are also very customizable.I was unsure whether I'd like or use the fingerprint reader but I have it enabled and it recognizes me maybe 80% of the time, it has definitely seemed to improve since I first turned on the feature.The keys glide smoothly and are very ergonomic in their placement. One of my requirements was a built-in num pad because I use it for school and finances daily and again, I really like the layout. My old laptop also had a num pad but it seemed to turn on randomly and was difficult to turn it back on (it wasn't just a simply num lock issue). I have yet to experience any issues with keeping num lock turned on.It does come with a stylus. I have only used it once when I set up the laptop just to play with it. Seems pretty cool, I can see how some people might like it for taking notes or drawing. The pen itself is weighty like a fountain pen and seems very responsive.A few complaints:The other reviews are correct, the processor speed is not advertised correctly. When I open up my specs it reads 1.8GHz not 4.9GHz or whatever it claims to be. It hasn't really become an issue yet though. For running Matlab, Excel, Chrome, and Solidworks simultaneously it does not seem to slow the system down to an annoying point.Additionally, there is only one USB and one USB-c port. I usually have my wired mouse and printer plugged in which both use USB. I bought a multiport adapter that plugs into the USB-c port for my printer which is a bit more unwieldy but it's manageable since I usually use my laptop at a desk.All in all, a great laptop so far. I'm loving the touchpad, num pad, and unit weight!",0
"(Not as described): One of the functions I wanted was the backlit keyboard, this laptop stated it has it. Guess what, it doesn't.Sending back and try to find another laptop.",0

"(Laptop muy buena): Buena adquisición llego en perfecta condiciones, una buena inversion.",0
"(ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH55 - Powerful, Light, Economical): Are you on a mid to high end budget? Trying to find a PC that's lightweight and small, without compromising power? Do you care little for 2-1 computers or touch screens? Then this laptop is for you.The specs on this little book are phenomenal. The main selling point for this computer is its 8th Gen Intel i5-8250U processor. The processor is monstrous for this price range. Its base speed of 1.6 GHz, means that your computer will be drawing as little power as possible for low demand tasks like word processing or internet browsing. But its turbo boost up to 3.4 GHz ensures that this laptop has power for more demanding tasks.Oh, and did I mention that this processor has FOUR CORES? Yes, that's right FOUR CORES. This is unusual at this price range, as many laptops on the market around $750 tend to have dual core processors instead. This laptop's processing power rivals, and some cases exceeds others around the $1,000 mark.The PC has enough RAM at 8 GB. Sufficient for most tasks the average consumer will face, and still enough for those looking for an edge. The 256 Solid State Drive provides a reasonable amount of storage. When combined with the processor on this PC, it boots up swiftly.Its battery is more than sufficient for all day use. If you find yourself running low on power, the charger itself is extremely lightweight, and in my experience the laptop is capable of charging around 50% of its battery to near full in about an hour.All of this performance doesn't even take into consideration that this laptop is a lightweight, coming in at 2.6 pounds. As a personal opinion, being able to pick up such a light computer knowing it packs FOUR CORES of power at this price range is an unparalleled high.This laptop is absolutely stellar.",0
"(Resistant to viruses): Love it, used everyday",0
(seems to work well): I haven't had it long enough to really rate it. My last one only lasted one year. I will give a better review after one year with this one. So far it is about 3/4 as fast as it was when I got it.,0
(Buen Precio): La compre para mi hermano y esta muy contento.,0
"(SLOW): This thing is slow. My daughter can't use this for online school. So frustrating. Unfortunately my ""return window"" has lapsed so instead I'll just leave this review here. DON'T BUY.",0
"(Excellent Quality, Lots of Power, Too small Hard Drive): Great gaming laptop, but the Hard Drive is too small. I'm already at 80% full with just a few games loaded.",0
"(Worse than you've heard): Do not get the Midnight Blue... the fingerprint problem is worse than you could possibly imagine. Yes, even after washing your hands and using a microfiber cloth before each use.Other than that, Laptop is great.",0
"(No issues/no problems): I wanted to wait until I had used this item for a couple of weeks before completing a review . There have been no issues and no problems and it arrived on time and at a good price. This is the second ACER I have had and both have been reliable with excellent battery life. It's a fairly basic unit but for what I use it for, I am pleased with it.",0
"(Best budget laptop on the market): With Linux (beta) available from google, this is the best laptop available for the price",0
"(It's ok...I don't love it and I miss having a built-in CD/DVD drive): I probably shouldn't be writing a review since I'm not a maven on computers. All I know is that I miss having a CD/DVD drive that doesn't take up more space on my desk than my previous bigger laptop. It's ok, but I don't love it. The power button and the plugins seem to be in awkward places in my humble opinion.",0
I wish it was a full keyboard with the number pad to the right,0
(Three Stars): kind of slow,0
(This is not good business): This was not the product I paid for I was lured in by the backlight and fingerprint(theirs on the right) and was taken back to see none of the features(the one I received on the left),0
(Graphic quality): Only thing is the screen isn’t the best quality but it’s a cheap laptop that works good,0
(Great for school work): Great chrome book for 11 year old,0
"(Excelente Computadora Lapto): Excelente articulo, buen tiempo de entrega,muy recomendado",0
"(Only if you do heavy stuff): If you need a laptop, AND you need a computer to do computationally heavy stuff, like 3D-graphics, games, Data Science, then you can save a lot by buying this gaming laptop. Everything runs quick, smooth, and without overheating.If you just need a stationary gaming station, still, you can buy this laptop and use it as a tower PC. The price is great.If you only do the light stuff, like browsing, work with documents, watching movies, then it's not the best choice for you. For example, I own a 2016 Macbook, that you can buy for the same money. I do all the light stuff on the Macbook. Reasons I don't use MSI that mush:1) Horrible noise from the cooling system. (it may be the case you can cut the noise by cutting the power, I didn't try). The loudest I ever heard from a laptop.2) Too quiet speakers. The most quiet I ever heard.3) The trackpad gives me pain every time. I have to use a mouse.4) The keyboard is decent, but not great.5) Everything looks ugly. I don't like the Windows interface. Everything has sharp, unsmoothed edges. I don't like how the fonts look like, reading gives me nausea6) It's very thick and heavy. Especially, if I take the AC adapter with me. And the high computational power requires the AC adapter.7) Macbook and iPhone work together naturally",0

"(Average Gamer’s review: Great for gaming): Pros:144 FPS is really nice.Graphics and GPU are great for Warzone and RL. I’ve had no problems with gaming or internet browsing.Cons:The bloatware, just remove it so you have extra space.Norton is annoying.The battery will last maybe 3 hours, seemingly no matter how much or little you are doing.The fans get loud and it gets hot, I plan on getting a cooling pad.After three weeks of use it works as it should. I study and play rocket league primarily so I’m not asking a ton from it. One thing I noticed is that the FPS drops automatically to 60 if the charger isn’t connected. Maybe I need to go into settings. I also had to adjust the brightness and wear blue light glasses because it put a higher strain on my eyes than just playing with a console with a tv. Overall, I’m very happy I got this and I think it will last a while. Very sturdy, very buff graphics and gpu, and spot on price for a solid budget friendly, higher performing gaming laptop.",0
"(Fine laptop, suits my needs perfectly but I did add memory to it.): I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this laptop. It seemed like a good computer for the price. Many if the reviews said it was short on memory. It has a SSD drive but it is a bit on the small side, and the built in ram was lacking at only 4 gb. There is an open slot for ram and a space for a second hard drive already there. The company included a pack of hard drive screws with a web site to instruct you on how to install a second drive. Since I had a like new 1tb laptop drive and a 8gb memory card laying around, I waisted no time. The upgrade was simple.Honestly, I have no complaints with this laptop. Some people complained about the screen. I don't know why, it's very clear to me. Battery life is fine, but I am just a home user so I am not on it for hours at a time. The speakers point down from under the computer, but I can still hear what I need to so no big deal to me. I even don't mind the touch pad on this one (hated the one on my last computer).If you are a gamer or someone who needs a super powerful computer for intense graphics, this probably isn't your best choice. But for home use, I am very happy with this laptop and would certainly recommend it.",0
"(Frequently won't shutdown): This product is basically okay but has one major problem in you can't remove the battery easily to do a hard shutdown. In frequent occasions I haven't been able to shut it down. This seems to be a known Windows 11 problem. I have run the power troubleshoot several times to be informed there isn't a problem but it still won't shutdown. With Acer laptops in the past I simply have removed the battery to do a hard shutdown to resolve things. With this model that appears to require taking it apart. It's a toss up who to find at fault, Microsoft or Acer.",0
A laptop with multiple foldable screens that could combine to form a larger display might be the perfect solution. This would offer the best of both worlds: portability and a large viewing area.,1
(What a great price for a great product): What a great price for a great product ! Have enjoyed my computer for almost 3 months with no issues.,0
(IN LOVE): I absolutely love this MacBook!! It has a finger print scan to unlock it and to fill in passwords which is so handy. The battery life lasts for a long time. The screen quality is flawless. It’s super fast and comes with so many useful apps on it!,0

"(Be warned: only the 32gb ram version will be able to play any videogames): The computer is fine for every application except gaming. Beautiful, lightweight, etc. Unfortunately, I had to check the Samsung website itself to see that the ""good"" graphics card is only available on the 32gb model.This $1000+ computer cannot run SKYRIM (SE) on its lowest setting. Be warned!",0
"(Overall good laptop for light gaming and school): Pros: 1080p ips screen, ram and drive upgradability, gaming performanceCons: loud ass fans, cringe gamer aesthetic, keyboard and trackpad",0
"(The worst product out there for Chromebooks): This is the most useless product to call itself a computer I have ever seen. It shouldn't even have been produced. Just a waste of resources and more garbage to pile up. My kids played with $30 computers for children that were faster. I just wish my son had started school and discovered how bad it is before the return window closed. Just one Chrome window tab and it takes 2 minutes to load. Chromebook or Chromepaperweight. Usually I like Samsung. I always buy their phones. Fortunately the school has one to lend him until he gets a real computer. The Lenovo from school actually works, Flex 5, it's not bad.",0
(Treat yourself to an upgrade): Beautiful device. Perfect for simply web browsing and ideal for teachers like myself that need to use Microsoft Office and Google Classroom etc. Definitely worth every penny. Treat yourself if you’ve been debating this over a PC laptop.,0
(Unusable due to constant crashing): The laptop kept crashing and giving blue screens of death from day one right out of the box. Couldnt fix despite doing all necessary updates and troubleshooting. Ended up returning to get a refund because i didnt want to even bother trying to get a new one after that.Edit: almost a month later and i still have not recieved my refund. Could not be more angry or disappointed in this experience,0
"(Great): This laptop was for my daughter she loves it , it is fast and perfect for her needs",0
"(Worth the money): I bought it because I wanted a very fast laptop for work and everyday activities... that I could take on vacations and play games if I wanted. It handles Sea of Thieves on Mythical graphics no problem. Love the laptop, worth the money...Only issue, I had to get a replacement the first week or so. Because it wouldn’t let me install games from the Microsoft Store to my hard drive. It acted like it didn’t exist. I even reinstalled the OS.So I just sent it back and got a replacement (within 30 days) so I highly recommend making sure it can download games and do everything you want while in your Amazon return window.Side note- will definitely buy more high valued items on Amazon due to their quick shipment of my new laptop.",0
(Screen flicker): Received this laptop - has screen flickering right from the start and it only got worse in a matter of days. Returning it for a refund.,0
(Amazing Speed!): Excellent machine!,0
"(Unsolvable bluescreen issue on this gaming laptop & damaged item): I first received the laptop back in Oct 2021 but did not open to check as I trust Amazon for all of their products based on all of my previous experiences. Not until recent days, did I decide to open the box and give it a try Initially, everything was fine, then I noticed a broken part on the back of the laptop. I couldn't believe it. I don't know if this is Lenovo's problem or Amazon's problem. And things only got worse from here. Within the first 30 mins of using this laptop, the constant bluescreen told me that an ""unknown problem has occurred. We need to gather some information then you may restart your laptop"". When I say constant, I mean every 5 mins and no, I did not open a crazy amount of software or anything, it was only youtube watching (3 - 4 tabs on chrome) while downloading Genshin Impact from the official website.After some research online (i should have done this before purchasing), it appears that this is a faulty issue on this laptop and is causing many users unusable. And this problem is unsolvable (even after contacting Lenovo support). So basically I spend 1k on a laptop with a serious flaw.I am returning this right now and will update my experience here regarding the return status.My personal suggestion, stay away from this laptop. Find one that doesn't give you an unsolvable bluescreen gaming laptop.",0

"(Great Laptop BUT....): This is a good laptop and does everything that I want it to do. HOWEVER the battery life on this laptop is horrible. Within in hour of it running without being plugged in, the battery has completely died. It has been like this since I purchased in April/May 2022. Very disappointed that if I want to use this when traveling, it has to remain plugged in at all times.",0
(It takes so long to restart.): There has to be a problem with the operating system.,0
(Best bang for the buck!): Best bang for the buck!,0
"(Best value for the Graphics card, MSI reliability): I've had this for about two months now. I'm really happy with it.Cheapest RTX 2070 laptop I could find. That's what I'm paying for, is a nice display and the solid graphics card. This is probably the best computer I've ever bought. If you're looking for a solid gaming-able laptop that isn't the absolute top tier, this is it!!I heavily recommend a cooling fan pad/stand, it will greatly increase airflow and keep your laptop cool and less noisy.The GL65 leaopard is 100 dollars cheaper than the GP65 leopard solely because the case is made of plastic and not aluminum. Fine by me, I don't plan on hauling this thing around, and I routinely clean fingerprints, so they don't bother me at all.MSI comes with their Dragon Center dashboard, which will show you CPU, memory, SSD usage and intenral temperatures. It will also allow you to control the keyboard LEDs, and set battery charge intervals. I like this dahsboard.The keyboard backlit LEDs are gorgeous.Bulky, but not particularly heavy. But this is expected of any laptop with a beefy (non-slim design) graphics card. I don't mind this, it mostly stays on my desk.Early wear on keyboard letters: The keys are clear plastic to show the LEDs, and are painted to show the letters ans symbols. This paint seems cheap and is already starting to fade through two months in.Trackpad click feels fragile. But who cares? Most gaming folks will use a mouseOnly 3 USB ports, you may need an adapter.I'm only concerned about the hinge system. I know this is a standard for MSI, but this mechanical part looks small, I'd hate for this wear and tear to break computer.Screen is matte and no glare means I can see nicely.I like having a number pad too!I'm willing to sacrifice a little on the SSD size for the great graphics card. To me, 500GB is plenty, I have external drives for any massive storage I may need.",0

Hanging at gameplay like few minutes after start up and restart again. I was told that it's under international warranty but can't go to the local service center for repair. They told me to send it back to USA or Canada. My opinion, don't buy Acer predator and this will be my LAST Acer product.",0

"(best...laptop...ever...): I would take a bullet for my Lenovo X1 Carbon. I love this thing. If it was a dude, id be gay with it.",0
"(Best value for the price): Can play new games with the highest settings without issues. Can handle various demanding programs simultaneously (such as Bloomberg and Excel, statistical or coding programs, and DAWs like Ableton Live) without overheating and crashing. The overall build is sturdy - the screen and keys aren't flimsy or delicate. It has all the features that other laptops typically priced around $1800+ currently have. The only con so far is that the built-in speakers don't sound very good, but having a good pair of headphones or external speakers should fix that.",0
"(Great Budget Laptop, Terrible Customer Service): So far this seems like a great laptop. While running a game and the fans are spinning, its actually pretty quiet compared to other gaming laptops I've had.One thing I'm disappointed in is the color of the keyboard. the LEDs are just white. I read some reviews on this product page stating that there is an option to enable colors on the keyboard. When I load Lenovo Vantage there is no such option and I'm SUPER disappointed. I realize it's superficial but it's nice to have other color options than just the white.**Changing to a 1-star review after terrible customer service. The screen is starting to go out, it will flicker and be discolored etc. I contacted support and initially they were helpful and went through all the normal diagnostics. I think once they realized it was the hardware and would need to be replaced, they started becoming SKETCHY. They told me they called me several times within a weeks span, I never received any voicemails or emails communicating this. Another week goes by and they tell me the ticket is closed because I wasn't cooperating. MY warranty expired 3/5 the same week they did this. I think they realized the warranty was almost up and didn't want to do what is right. I'm very disappointed in this company because I had such high hopes for the Legion brand. I just want them to make it right and they haven't.",0
(Best MacBook Air ever?! Minus the fingerprints?): Absolutely love this computer. No issues with it at all. I think upgrading to the 512g is worth it. It’s an expensive computer only to have the base model at 256g. It’s a great every day computer!,0

The screen color is amazing and perfect brightness,0
"(awesome laptop): this computer is everything I need for my at home, personal use. Very fast, keyboard is comfortable to use,. This is not the computer you want for gaming or heavy duty business, but for home use (e-mail, reading newspaper, web-surfing, personal banking, and of course playing candy crush) this computer is awesome. I can't speak for the battery life because I basically leave it plugged in at my desk. I would recommend this computer.",0
(Keyboard light stopped working.): Horrible for more than 2k laptop. The keyboard light stopped working within the first week of purchase. Poor customer service from both manufacturer and distributor/seller.,0
"(Overall Good): This laptop has a lot of great features like the low price, quality screen, and backlit keyboard. The only bad-ish thing, which is probably a me thing, is the mousepad has a slight tactile feedback built into it using horizontal ridges that feels bad on my fingers.",0

"(Budget laptop, but with great features): It have 2 M2 ports, i like that GPU and comes with an intel for low power consumption. I had serious bleeding screen problems but acer customer service helped with that and thay put a new one. This is a budget screen so if you want pure blacks on it search for another model. For gaming use a cooling base. touchpad and mouse controls are accurate. I like it I'm a casual gamer and also I use this laptop for working. I'm industrial designer and Solidworks, rhinoceros, keyshot and adobe suite 2020 work nice.",0
(What a piece of junk! 😡): Kept locking up. Perpetual blue screen of death. Customer service only solution was to restore again n again and then an Automatic repair. They were polite but pretty much useless and they never returned my calls. I probably called them a dozen times with my issue. Through my own research I found that Office 2007 wasn’t always compatible with Win 10. I upgraded to Office 2019 and this kept it from locking up. No thanks to Asus useless tech support.This Asus junk takes forever just to open File Explorer just to view the contents of folder. Then you’re sitting there looking as the icon spins round and round just to view contents. Even slower opening a program. Go make a sandwich as you wait.Connection to the internet times out every few minutes and takes a couple minutes to manually reconnect. All my other devices work fine on WiFi except the Asus junk. That’s why I’m writing this review on my phone. It’s easier and more reliable then using the laptop.See my attached pics of what I’m describing. The only reason I still have this piece of junk is because of my work schedule I had it for 30 days and couldn’t return it Amazon. My fault there.,0

"(Great Lil Lapblet!): Great little laptop and tablet! The battery life is outstanding and the quality is great. Although the sound is not that good, this device replaced my iPad and I have never missed it! Small and portable, does everything I need!",0
(No comment): No Comment,0
"(Piece of crap): Technically the laptop itself meets my needs, but the resident programming sucks. I do not like nor use McAfee, and having their annoying popups every few seconds makes me hate it.I've gone into Control Panel to delete the program, but the popups persist.",0
"(Great laptop, but): The laptop overall has a very good build quality, I like it very much! The software are well written to change all the settings. Only the battery life is poor.Another problem found after a few days of use. The M.2 slot 2 is having some problem, where the SSD in it is very slow. I will have to send back the laptop to manufacturer for further check. Let's see how it goes.Update: I got back the laptop from CS with the motherboard replaced. The SSD speed is back to normal now. Appreciate the short turnaround time for fixing it!** I am receiving a warranty extension from ASUS for this feedback. **",0
(The New Age of Client devices): One of the best chromebooks on the market. 4GB models are good at having more tabs open and switching between them; the 14 in. full HD is perfect for mobile or fixed. Printing is through google cloud print and is best done by getting a wireless certified google printer which can be less than $50 or if you want to use a Win PC as a server there is a process for that too. If mobile and no printers handy just spool print (pdf) files to local or a flash drive but your best option long term is to modify the download location to Google drive and have unlimited space.Later this year this model will allow Android apps to be executed which means Skype and offline too. Next year Google will release a new OS Andromeda which combines Chrome OS and Android. It's not clear what if any migration path will be available to current Chromebooks but the pundits seem to think Chrome OS will continue to be developed in parallel but even that will have Android app capability. WillAndromeda finally give head to head competition to Windows............we see in 2017 but clearly the domination of Windows is over in the mobile space and now the PC space will have Andromeda as an alternate.,0
"(Satisfied): Rey nice laptop, easy to set up and use",0
"(Some Good, Some Bad, Some Meh.): I've had this laptop for a week now, and while there is much to like, there is also a few things that make me wish I had bought a different machine.PROS: Display is GORGEOUS, and the dedicated graphics handle my current favorite game--FFXIV--at ultra high settings. Boot time is non-existent due to the SSD. The keyboard is a real pleasure to use. It's QUIET and gives good feedback. It's also intelligently laid out. I love that there's a num-pad. Also, aesthetically, the lighting is a lot of fun. I don't usually buy gaming laptops for the bling, but hey ... I'll take bling when it comes my way. It has plenty of ports, and feels solid. I don't feel like it's going to fall apart on me.CONS: The CPU runs HOT. And while this is to be expected when processing a high-graphics, high-input game, the fans are NOISY. The chassis grows hot in the upper margins above the top row of keys (I suspect this is where the CPU is housed), and if you want to keep it cooler, you have to crank the fans waaaay up. The GPU is fine. This pertains only to the CPU. This feeds into the next complaint: The audio for this machine truly sucks. The speakers are located on the bottom of the machine, so with the fan noise and the speaker location all the audio is either inaudible or very muddy. I had to lift the laptop up to make out what someone was saying in a Youtube vid--and the speakers were on high. This is purportedly a gaming laptop, and games have soundtracks that people want to hear. This just feels like they tried to cut corners. Lastly, I had to disable the camera driver. It would switch the camera on and off randomly and in quick succession whenever I'd start up a game.So ... yeah. If you want it for high-end gaming, maybe find a different machine that won't bring you annoyances. If you are playing videos, or listening to music only, or using it for writing, etc, you'll be fine.Five stars for the screen. Three stars for the gaming due to the sound issues, and lack of sluggish cooling for the CPU. I only use it plugged in, so I can't attest to the battery life ... hence four stars.The picture is an example of how high the resolution is in a gaming environment. Sweet stuff.",0
(Reasonable price and good quality for the money): very easy to use and fast!,0
"(Great laptop.): Rather than list all the positives, I'll just list the negatives. Much shorter list.Battery is atrocious as is the speakers and Webcam.512GB SSD is very lacking size wise, but added another 2TB SSD as there are 2 slots for for SSD drives and another for 2.5 inch hard drive. Ram is also easily upgradable.Fantastic price/performance here.",0

(Easy to upgrade): Fast and eaay to upgrade,0
(Perfect): Great ! Love it,0
(Five Stars): Has worked well and would recommend it to a friend.,0
"(Just what I needed): I needed a laptop to work from home. Basics email, spreadsheet, and access on my company’s online system. Some entertainment here and there.I researched every affordable laptop I could find. I read articles on brands, ram and features. Asus is obviously underrated. The brand name kept popping up as a favorite. But I had never owned or used one.I received this laptop today and immediately fell in love with the sleek, slim and simple look. The keyboard feels good and I love that it has a 10 key without being bulky and bigger. I uninstalled several defaulted apps, downloaded chrome and tested it out. The screen quality is better than some reviews I read. The sound quality is acceptable. I don’t plan to jam out on it. And if I stream videos or movies, I’d rather use my ear buds. It runs quickly and I never felt it get hot. The fan has a nice low hum. Just enough to softly let you know it’s there, doing it’s job.Overall, I’m super happy with my purchase. I’m not a gamer and I don’t download much outside of reports for work. I think this is perfect for what I need. Unless something drastic happens, I cannot see myself updating my review to anything less than 5 stars.",0
(Great computer!): I am starting a small business and I did so much research on trying to fit one that fits my needs. This computer is the one. I turned off the S mode and still work perfect. I am soooo happy I was able to get this laptop!,0
"(Killer SPEED, solid hardware): It's fast. That's why I got it. I've never owned a Microsoft computer. I'm getting inside Bill Gates' mind by understanding this little silver bullet. I have hope it will not let me down. I feel guilty spending this much money on myself but I'm investing in my education. I get pissed at this Acer Aspire often bc I don't know what it's talking about and I realize I need to chill and learn to communicate with computer aka Bill Gates' brain. It will be okay. I'm learning the language of a new system. It's annoying but I did use the video editor and made a movie and that was fun and somewhat easy. Basically, this is a really powerful fast operating system. Get a Bluetooth speaker and a battery pack.",0
"(Good simple computer, good value for the $$$): Some reviews compared to a Macbook, which is unfair. This computer costs 1/3 price and you should expect some trade offs for saving that $1000. I am using it only for internet access and simple word processing, spreadsheet tasks. Does those jobs admirably. It is a bit slow to start up and needs a nudge to connect ""automatically"" to my trusted wifi networks. But nothing a couple of seconds patience won't overcome.",0
"(Screen is too reflective): I purchased the i7 version of this laptop about a month ago. It is fast. and build solidly. However, no matter how great the specs are and how responsive it is, if you can't see the screen , it is useless. I called tech support for Lenovo a couple of times with no success. First tech tried to repair it with no success, and the second tech just said return it because that's the way the screens on these laptops are designed. It is so reflective that it is a serious strain to work for more than a few minutes in a lite room and it cannot be seen at all in sunlight.",0
"(eh): not much, but it didn't cost much either.",0
(Un producto regular): La bocina no es la mejor,0
"(Amazing laptop): Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully! The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.",0
(Great laptop): I’ve had a 2012 MacBook Pro and it’s still running good just a lil slow. Now to upgrade to this MacBook Air not a big difference but runs way smoother,0
"(A great gaming laptop): After 12 months of owning this, i can say it was a very nice and solid choice of a laptop for the price i got it for (1000$).+ The Pros:- Slick design that doesn't scream gamer.- The laptop build is solid.- Keyboard is pleasant to type on.- Nice and vibrant screen.- Plays anything i throw at it with ease (@1080p 60fps on god of war. 120+ fps apex legends. 90+ fps monster hunter rise. 200+ fps divinity original sin).- Runs cool, CPU and GPU doesn't exceed 75c in most demanding games/applications (if you apply the tips below).- Decent 4.5 hours battery life.- The Cons:- The 3050ti is actually great but the 4gb of vram might prevent you from choosing very high textures in games or could be an issue if you try to render super heavy scenes in 3d softwares that require alot of vram. (For me it was enough to run Lumion 3D without issues and it never exceeded 4GB)- My unit has high pitched fans so it's loud under load.Tips to reduce your CPU and GPU temperatures on the laptop:1- Have the back of your laptop raised by few centimeters to allow more air into the vents. (3 to 5c lower temps)2- Play on balanced mode instead of Performance, you will get lower temps (by up to 10c) and not much performance is lost (5% to 10% at worst, at least that's what i saw with my games.)3- Disable boost, this had minor impact on my fps but i had cooler temps on my ryzen 5800h temps (14c lower temps).To disable boost follow steps below:– Run cmd as administrator and type in:powercfg -attributes sub_processor perfboostmode -attrib_hideThis will reveal a setting ""Processor performance boost mode"" in the advanced options in your power plan settings that lets you enable or disable boost.– If you want to Undo the previous operationpowercfg -attributes sub_processor perfboostmode +attrib_hide– Configure it in your preferred power plan:Control Panel/Power Options/Change Plan Settings/Change advanced power settings/Processor power management/Processor performance boost modeWhile Disabled (Default: Aggressive) your thermals will improve drastically with minimal or zero performance lost depending on the game.If you don't want to completely disable it use Efficient Aggressive.Note that disabling boost reduces performance when doing demanding non-gaming workloads like rendering (mostly CPU workloads), so disable it if you want max performance at the cost of more heat.[Review updated with pictures showing temperature improvements for both CPU (Ryzen 7 5800H) and GPU (3050TI) using the tips above running Monster Hunter Rise]",0
"(A gorgeous, profession laptop for gamers.): a truly lovely laptop, gorgeous screen, weighty but solid, decent stereo sound, rugged, understated and premium. Only downside is that it needs to be near a plug on all the time",0
"(Great overall package - internal speakers really the only letdown): Perfect PC for my teen - light and durable for school, and powerful enough to get through everything he is using it for, as well are normal gaming use (Roblox, Minecraft etc).The keyboard is well laid out and the backlit feature is awesome, and the connectivity is good too - the large number of ports (USB C and A, HDMI and Ethernet, 3.5mm Headphone) are good to have, and the Bluetooth and WIFI seems snappy and stable as well.Possibly, only criticism is that the audio quality from the internal speakers is awful - when compared by my old MBP at least - but using a Bluetooth or wired speaker or headset means you can avoid that anyway.",0
(The worst laptop I have dealt with in years!): it wouldn't even turn on when taken out of the box,0
"(Bad battery, now won’t even boot.): Battery life about an hour unplugged running wow. Runs wow fine. Laptop runs hot enough to burn legs. 3 months in will not boot due to “no bootable device”",0
(At This Price Not Much Else Competes): I had been looking online for laptops for quite a while trying to find something with an i7 and an rtx card at a good value. Coming across this laptop I think I put it in my cart immediately and do not regret the decision. The screen is beautiful and the keyboard is fluid along with the power expected from the specs. The laptop does get a but loud with the internal fans but if you can get over that this should check off any box in what you would want out of a laptop. Also the smaller sized ssd leaves hope's for more storage but there is a slot to put additional storage so all in all a cheap upgrade to make a great laptop perfect.,0
(Calidad precio): El producto muy bien pero el empaque en el que lo envían pésimo la caja llegó echa trizas lo bueno que el producto llegó bien,0

the keyboard doesn't lock on one side of the tablet,0
"(MacBook Pro fills my need): What a great improvement over my old MacBook Pro. This is my third such computer. It keeps me in touch with the world and Amazon. What bugs me is the razzle dazzle passwords I must come up with to access other sites which is why I use Amazon almost exclusively There are so many goodies on this one that I will probably use only a few, though it is made for the new generation of users.

"(Great computer, but don't expect it to be something it's not): I'm a 40 year old mom who wanted a small laptop for writing, and that's exactly what I got. It's perfect for my needs, small, light, and has decent battery life. I use it for streaming shows and movies, and browsing Pinterest, Instagram, and Twitter, and it also works perfect. My only complaint is the screen resolution gets pixelated when I try to zoom in when watching shows. I wouldn't think it's a good gaming computer, because if it was my 12 year old son would be begging to use it everyday. But, he doesn't, and I get it all to myself. If you want it for the basics, get this Chromebook, it's a good one.",0
"(Random hardware crashes.): Have had this computer since 7/20 and it has been in for repair three times. I still have not received my daughters computer as it is still in Texas on the third repair. Even going through the factory repair suggestions and procedures, I still don't have the computer back. My daughter is heartbroken and need this for school. 750.00 dollars down the drain in my opinion. I would look elsewhere for a more reliable machine. You have been warned.",0
"(Bought if for my small business and I made the right choice.): It's fast, durable, and does everything I need it to do. I thought about buying parts to upgrade it before I got it but when I started using it I decided against it. I killed the battery pretty fast using it for the first time so I usually just keep it plugged in but there are battery saving options for those that intend to use the battery and to use that keep it plugged in to preserve the life of the battery.",0
"(Good machine, broke after 3 years): I bought this laptop (i5, 256 GB SSD version) in May 2017 for college. It has handled everything I’ve thrown at it, multiple windows, fortnite, movies, etc. battery life was also very good.3 years later the crappy plastic they use hasn’t held up. The plastic around the left hinge and in between the bottom of the screen has split so bad it’s unusable now. The laptops still operates well, but I have to buy a new one cause of the build quality. Gonna look for something metal/aluminum now.Also the laptops a bit to heavy for my liking, and for college students I recommend a smaller screen laptop.",0
"(Critically Acclaimed): If you can afford it, this is a great computer",0

"(Four Stars): Good Chromebook, you get for what you paid.",0
(The truth about this laptop): Iove laptop. Just as a warning I read two things before buying this laptop that don't appear to be true. First it says it uses a samsung m.2 hd and it came with hynix m.2. Not a deal breaker. Second it says it has a second m.2 slot but is a short socket version. It does not. Only found the 2.5 slot in which I used a 1tb samsung ssd. No deal breaker but I was alittle bummed. Otherwise this laptop is super smooth at play. The fans sound like allot of moving nair but no fan wine sounds. I will have to say this machine plays 2k @ 144 with zero ticks over three hour plus gaming.,0
"(Blue Screens frequently, manufacturer doesn't allow resets): I bought this laptop and have been using it for about 9 months. Immediately after I bought it, it would start blue screening while in use (almost always due to kbclass.sys despite the fact that the keyboard is built-in) and then would not start up for 2-3 days. The manufacturer has blocked resets and I can't reset the PC from the cloud, from a USB device, or from the local file system.Don't buy this laptop.It breaks and is unfixable.",0

(Good laptop for the price): This was a gift for my God daughter. She needed a laptop to finish her at home school courses & she has been using it for over a month now. It seems to be working well and suits her needs Good purchase.,0
"(Solid workhorse, great for school!): This thing runs for days! It's fast and good enough for the majority of my day to day functions. I upgraded RAM (very easy to do!) and can easily run MS office, VMWare, and others with little latency. Only thing I have found to dislike is that there are only two USB ports (excluding USB-C), but even that hasn't been an issue.",0
"(It's a really good PC): Overall, it's really nice for the price. My only real complaint is that there is one audio jack that has a menu for five or six different options, I would have preferred separate mic and headphone jacks but it's bearable. I have it, my brother has one, and my friend's brother has one. It's very good quality for the price.",0

Sucks I can't keep it.Jordan Rushton",0
"(Just so slow): This Acer Chromebook functions, but not well. All I use it for is Google Chrome, and I don't do anything data-intensive like streaming videos or games -- just basic browsing, Google Docs, etc. This machine is SO slow, and it has been from the time I bought it a few years ago. I kept thinking that the frequent Chrome updates would fix the issue, but they never did. This is my second Acer Chromebook and I think I'm just done with this particular manufacturer. Yes, they're cheap, but if it takes you minutes for a webpage to load when it takes seconds on another machine, you're just wasting your valuable time.",0
"(Cumplido lo prometido): Todo funciona súper bien, tal cual se ofrece",0
(Fast): I am satisfied,0
"(Highly recommend, great price): Great laptop",0
(Stopped working in first 3 weeks): I purchased this for the features of an actual PC not a tablet. Boy was that a mistake. This is the slowest laptop/pc/tablet whatever it is I have ever used and after only about 6 hours of use it will not turn on anymore. I am attempting to go thru ASUS for a refund or warranty fix. This thing is absolute garbage.,0
"(From Mac Air to Chromebook without looking back! Great transition!!!): It is very stressful for me to get new tech, being a more ""experienced"" person. My last phone had me wanting to throw it into large vats of water or stomp it with both feet and I did return it 3 times before finally managing to semi-adjust to it and I now have a so-so relationship with that piece of frustrating technology. So, when my Mac Air started to circle the drain I dreaded getting a new lap top. When my son recommended Chromebook I was skeptical that it could be as simple as it sounded to set up and use. But I was totally amazed!!! I had the lap top open and I was logged in with gmail in 5 minutes.Anything that I have needed to do has been easy to google. The screen quality and sound are both better than I had with the Mac but it was pretty old. The simple set up, speed and use of docs and downloads has been easy and I didn't have to buy software extra like I did with Mac. I also found connecting to my HP printer was much easier than the process to connect on my Mac.For me to transition from a Mac to the Chromebook was very smooth. This screen is so much larger than my Mac and has taken some getting used to. At this price my husband has encouraged me to get a smaller one to carry when we go somewhere but I am adjusting to this larger size. I thought the large size would be a viewing plus and it is. It's heavier than the small Mac and that is the adjustment. I use it for basics and work- banking, contracts, etc and I am very pleased!!! I will add that I never liked iPhones but did like my Mac Air but like the Chromebook much better so far.",0
"(Amazing performance--runs Valve Index--great deal): I needed a laptop that could run the Valve Index, for a super cool art project that I got a grant for. After many, many hours of researching laptops and one whole purchase-and-return of an Alienware machine, I got this one. It runs its video right off the graphics card through the mini DispalayPort and it handles the hard specs of the Index amazingly well. And it does it for cheap. GET IT GET IT GET IT!",0
"(Great product, unreliable seller): This is a really solid starter gaming laptop, it really fits all my needs. Only thing worth mentioning is the RAM is only 8GB, I’d definitely recommend getting a 16GB upgrade, but it does come with instructions on how to upgrade with the laptop. Still, it’s a very solid choice.",0
(Without ?): It does not have a camera/microphone,0
"(Economical): I'm not very tech savvy so I just like to open the thing and have it work and then don't do too much more than check accounts and social media and shopping. So I bought something from Target for like $200 and just could not get it to work or connect with a network and returned it the next day. This is a pricier unit obviously, but you still need to spend a certain amount to get anything more than a typewriter. I've always had success with Dell and there's nothing to figure out after you turn it on. Sure I'd love to spend a few thousand to be in the Jobs cult, but that seems like overkill to write a couple of book reviews and order a new pair of boots for work.",0
"(Make sure you don't mind Google Drive or Cloud based storage): I love the ease of use. I am a an avid Android user. I absolutely despise any and ALL Apple products. So naturally this is an ideal item. From what I've read and heard from other Chromebook users, Apple does do JUST Fine on these machines. The only downside is obviously the Internal Storage Capacity. For example, I have 16 GB storage and it suits me just fine as long as I remember to send to my Google Drive. So all in all, The Best buy I've personally made of a laptop. By the way, More Storage would have gained that Fifth star! Thanks Acer and Chrome OS!",0

"(Great gaming laptop): Runs smooth, great screen quality, and unless you’re installing a ton of large size games the 512GB SSD is good. It’s got it’s quirks- this is the first gaming laptop I’ve had that makes weird noises and physically lags a bit when you unplug it while using it, and I’ve noticed some instances (once a month or so) of graphical weirdness while watching videos online where things will get blurry and require a restart to fix itself- but for a gaming laptop with a 3060 at a decent price it so far seems like a winner. Great for someone who likes to keep up with a few new games every year and wants a machine that can handle that, though more hardcore folks may want to get something a bit bigger on the memory front.",0
"(I love ASUS! My last one died from my 3 ...): I love ASUS! My last one died from my 3 year old dumping water all over it, frying the mother board. I decided to get a new one. I love it so far. I have had it for about a week already. This one is just like my other one, but faster.",0

I love the RGB keyboard, the resolution, and has good battery life. I played Devil May Cry 5, Dying Light, Doom Eternal, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Battlefield 5 with ease. It gets a bit hot but nothing a cooling pad can fix. The only drawback is that it only has a 512GB SSD, if it had a HDD too I would give 5 stars.",0

"(5/5 Buy buy buy!): So many good things to say. RTX 2070 and ""budget"" don't usually belong in the same product description. Somehow, MSI made it work with a super powerful gaming machine that kicks ass and. Well, for the budget-oriented high-end gamer, this is all you ever need.—————————PERFORMANCE - 5,555/5This is not something you need worry about on this laptop. This machine pulls 100+ the most AAA demanding titles at the highest settings, thanks to the full RTX 2070 mobile GPU (not Max-Q).My Frames in some FPS games (high/ultra settings, 1080p):Warzone: 90s-120sPlanetside 2: 140s (VR training), 60s-80s (huge fights)Apex Legends: 90-100sThe main performance ""bottleneck"" is the i7-10750h CPU, which is obvious when comparing with the stupidly powerful RTX 2070 graphics card. Also makes sense since the CPU hits the 90+ C while GPU hits 70s. That being said, hitting the above framerates in games, I can’t complain.—————————THERMALS - 4/5Totally competent. Runs a little hotter than I hoped for, but won't thermal throttle out of the box (default “User” mode in Dragon center with high CPU, auto fans).Undervolting with XTU can be unlocked in the Advanced BIOS settings. I played around with some sliders, but I couldn’t get better performance than stock settings. YMMV.The fans are LOUD. When gaming, air blasts out the back and right side. Hot air blasts out the left side. Don’t leave any accessories to bake next to this laptop, and you’ll be fine. Thankfully, the keyboard stays cool and comfortable during long gaming sessions.I give 4/5 because it’s not something you’d really notice.—————————SCREEN - 5/5Tech reviewers give the response time as 5 ms, close to the advertised 3 ms. Without a way to test for it myself, I’d trust this figure.144 hz refresh rate is buttery smooth to the eye and more than good enough for FPS and action games. The screen is has deep contrast, though it seems biased towards darker colors. Full brightness may hurt your eyes though.—————————BUILD QUALITY/AESTHETICS - 4/5Impressive for the budget. Very thin screen bezels. Almost all metal except for the bottom panel. (But the screen does flex a little bit).It’s not the thinnest or prettiest laptop, but you won’t have to worry about people judging you outside. You won’t be bringing this outside! (with a weight of 9 pounds!). All in all, this laptop might be most portable desktop I ever had.—————————KEYBOARD - 5/5Unfortunately, compromises had to be made to fit a keyboard and numpad under a 15.6” size screen. The keyboard is slightly smaller than full size (but it’s easy to get used to).The keys feel pleasantly precise and have a decent amount of travel.All complaints are automatically nullified when you turn on the laptop. YIPPE KIYAY at how sick the RGB looks, thanks to Steelseries support.—————————TOUCHPAD - 4/5It’s meh. It is a Windows Precision trackpad, so it tracks smoothly.The surface is plastic, so it’s not smooth as glass, and skin oils/sweat quickly collects on the surface. The trackpad goes back to the old days when we had physical click and right click buttons. I would have preferred if the. But then again, you’re probably using a mouse anyways, so not a con.—————————I/O - 5/5A lot better than I expected (although I’m new to gaming laptops in general). HDMI, separate audio in/audio out, USB-C, 3x USB 3, SD card slot, ethernet, mini Displayport. Charging port on the right side.I would have preferred the ports to be on the back (would help clean up the cables a but), but it’s not something you notice while gaming.—————————SPEAKERS - use headphonesThey’re pretty bad, but who cares?",0
"(Regular): Es muy rápida, y cumple con lo que dice la rese?a... El problema es que salió defectuosa del sonido, hace ruidos muy extra?os de pronto, en distintas situaciones",0
"(randomly shuts off mid-game, mouse already broke): i’ve had this computer for not even a full year and it’s started to randomly turn off while i’m in the middle of a game. the screen goes back, and i can’t do anything, but the screen is still on because it’s not fully off, there’s light behind it. honestly, for the price, it’s not worth it, just go buy a razer.not only that, but a few months ago the mouse broke for no reason. i don’t violently click and i honestly use the tap-click feature more than i actually press the button, but now i can’t use the trackpad mouse unless i do the tap.",0
(Five Stars): amazing. great product you should get it now,0
(All the features for a low price): Incredibly fast and economical. Using for CAD and design work. Just needs an extra data hard drive.,0
The touch screen works flawlessly and the keyboard is comfortable and responsive.,0
It does get very hot while gaming.,0
(Great utility laptop!): Perfect size and set up. Easy to follow directions...love it!,0
"(ACER Predator 3060 is such a steal): This is a gaming laptop so don't be expecting 12 hr long battery life if you're doing things like gaming, 3d modeling, etc. I love the customizable keyboard and matte feel. The only con is 500GB storage is probably not enough unless you're constantly cleaning out storage and using an external hard drive, you can also put in your own ssd but the warranty will most likely be invalid if you do that so i suggest doing that after the warranty expires.",0
Battery life/portable mode is only ok.,0
"(Wow Nice Laptop but no game code): very good laptop, i got two pieces from it and it came without single issue. only one thing :( why no free games are coming with such expensive laptop.",0
"(A good machine with minor flaws): Trackpad, keyboard and battery life are great. There's some backlight bleed, but unless you plan on doing work at night with all the lights off AND have the screen brightness at maximum, you wouldn't be able to tell it's there. The keyboard flex everyone is worried about is negligible too. But, don't get this laptop if you just want to game on it. Games like Overwatch, Dota 2, CS:GO and LoL are fine, but not AAA titles unless you're willing to drop the settings to medium.",0
(2 defective items): First one had severe screen distortion. Replacement has just a black screen. Would not but this product again. Spent $50 to FedEx the 2nd laptop to the person that needed it immediately and 2nd one didn't work either. Going to buy a Mac book,0
(Great laptop!): Lovely laptop. Does the job well.,0
(Five Stars): Great replacement for a old chrome book!,0
"(Great laptop for the price): This laptop comes with everything you need. The i7 and 3060 combo is great for gaming. The 1080 screen with 144hz is smooth and fairly sharp. Also the upgradability is fantastic, you can throw in another m.2, a 2.5 inch ssd or hard drive, and switch both ram slots for higher capacity. The only downsides, screen has some bleed and the battery life is quite bad. Make sure you keep it plugged in, I get maybe 3 hours of internet browsing/streaming off of a full charge.",0
(Pretty good for me): I really like it. It seems to be built nicely the only down side is I had to update the drivers since I wanted to use it as a light gaming computer. Other than that I haven't had a problem.,0
(Great product.): Great product. Fast and easy to use.,0
(Great Machine): Lightweight compact overall great,0
(I like it but): I seriously like this laptop! affordable and it feels solid. the only thing I didn't like is the USB-C couldn't do a video out. everything else is top notch,0
"(It’s a good laptop): I take back what I said about this computer. Honestly the warranty it comes with makes up for the small flaws and for the price now, to me it’s more then worth it.",0
"(See ... okish): The S mode is my biggest turn off. This laptop is good for kids or light use. To be usable for more ... the SSD, RAM and OS should be upgraded. But, that is still cheaper then buying something with all these upgrades already installed.",0
(Excelente producto): Excelente producto,0
"(Error download messages and problems): I really dislike this computer. Little memory, can't load small games. Unfixable errors and explanations of ways to fix it does not offer much help. The mouse port and power cord ports both broke. Never again.",0
(Love it!): Love it!!! It arrived as promised and was exactly as described. This is my third Samsung Chromebook and I will continue to use this brand.,0
(Not bad for the price at all): I’m happy with it for being a chrome book. Not bad. Very user friendly and intuitive. Volume is good on it and battery life is good. The keys are really close together so it’s not good for extensive typing. I’m happy with it.,0
"(Worth the price): It’s a pretty good product, I only use to watch movies lol",0
Super fast and gaming is a breeze.,0
(The webcam........): Works well however I will note that I do not like the webcam and I only chose this model so I could have traditional usb type and not type c.,0
The HP Omen laptop is a well constructed and capable laptop that includes one of the latest generations of Nvidia RTX2060 GPU’s.,0
"(Fifth Acer Laptop in Our House Once Again Delivers a Lot of Bang for Your Buck): My wife and I both teach and have 11-year-old twins. Together, we have used four Acer laptops, an entry-level Nitron that has been going strong for 4 years; a top-of-the-line Triton 300 with 32gb of RAM and an RTX2080, which has given me outstanding performance for almost 3 years; and a 14-inch Acer Swift 3, in the home for a few months. All perform admirably for school and teaching, including Zoom meetings.Now I am reviewing a mid-level Acer gaming laptop, the Predator Helios 300, with an Intel Core i7-11800H, 16gb of RAM, 512 SSD, and an Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU.It arrives smartly packaged with a black sleeve for portable use. The first thing I noticed is that the chassis is built like a tank. I squeezed it with my thumbs and it felt solid. The membrane keys are typical spongy laptop keys on keyboards. I prefer mechanical keyboards with clickety clack blue or, in the case of Razer, green keys. You’ve got two USB ports on the left and one on the right if you want to hook up a mechanical keyboard. You also get an HDMI on the right if you want to hook up to the monitor. The power port is on the back in the center, a very logical choice, which I like.Set up was a breeze, took about 20 minutes, as I logged in with my credentials, and used Google Chrome, downloaded Spotify, and checked my settings for volume and mic.As you would expect, the Acer boots up quickly and gives you a racing sound. Also for a gamer laptop, you’re getting an aggressive grill in the back of the monitor, which conjures images of a race car grill.I turned on Netflix and watched a documentary on mushrooms and the images were excellent. The sound, even at full blast, was only mid-range, and when I opened Spotify and listened to some electronic pop (“At the River” by Groove Armada), I couldn’t get any loud sound, so if you’re looking for an immersive gaming experience, you’ll need to buy some external speakers. However, the sound is not cheap and tinny. For whatever reason, Acer didn’t tune these speakers for loud sound.Internet surfing, Netflix watching, and software downloads did not activate the fans. So far it has been quiet.You're getting 352 nits of screen brightness, which is good at this price point.Overall, this laptop is a joy to use. It handles Zoom meetings easily. While I’m not a gamer, I prefer gaming laptops for my Zoom instruction because gaming GPUs can handle all the Zoom updates. As my engineer friend explained to me, hosting a Zoom meeting is similar to gaming in terms of technical demands.If you’re looking for a tank of a gaming laptop with an RTX 3060, bright screen, and don’t mind using external speakers when you want to crank up your volume, I can give the Predator Helios 300 a strong recommendation.",0
"The lid and its hinges are suitably stiff, don't flop, wiggle or creak when I shake the machine with the screen at a reasonable angle",0
"(Perfect for Internet Apps): The Chromebook is light, thin and responsive. It's perfect for carrying around and accessing email etc.",0
Setting it up is a breeze thanks to Windows 10 and Cortana,0
(Very fast for an inexpensive unit): Extremely fast but not enough memory.,0
(Touch screen quit working after 90 days. Seller does not respond.): It started out to be a great laptop for $600.00. The fingerprint reader won't work for one of us but it does the other. Now the touch screen won't work. Its been just 89 days! We tried to contact the seller but no response. What will go next?,0
"(the work great): the really deliver ,play fornite ,call duty no one single problem,",0
(Gamer approved!! Love it!): I absolutely love this pc. I am a big gamer and it runs smooth as butter.,0
"(Nice little laptop!): I was in a tight spot with money but desperately needed a computer to cover the basics in my life. I was so afraid of making a bad decision, but I bought this chromebook a month and a half ago and I'm really happy with it!I can do everything I need to. Writing, going on social media, watching youtube videos, photo editing, etc. I haven't had any problems with functionality, and I personally really like the keyboard.It's a light, compact laptop I can bring anywhere, without feeling like I'm going to break it in half if I hold it wrong. If you're looking for a cheap chromebook, I do honestly recommend it.The only downside is the screen is a little... light? I have chronic dry eye so my vision is always slightly blurred and I would love an option to change the contrast to something more stark. The screen definitely gets *bright* enough, but black seems a little pale on white. But for all I know, this isn't something other people notice.",0
"(Perfect for portable work computer): I really enjoy this computer, but there are a few caveats.1) The audio for recording is not the best. And in order to turn off certain features like the background filter, you HAVE to sign up for their MyAsus account to have more control over features there. Why should we have to use an outside site to control features on a personal computer.2) The screen color isnt bad, but it isnt crisp. Feels like it has a haze filter over the screen.3) Definitely NOT for gaming, but I didnt buy it for that.All-in-all, it works well for what I need (work/organization), but not sure how well it would work for anything visual or complex editing.",0
(Light and beautiful screen): I love the screen. The lightness and thinness of the is astonishing.,0
"(THERE IS NO DVD PLAYER): We bought this and everything works fine, but there is NO DVD player as described and pictured, which is why we picked this specific laptop.",0
"(Doesn’t run google play store): Good computer perfect for school. The only thing that sucks is it doesn’t run google play store, but the new model does for only $40 more.",0
"(chromebook): very nice, my first chromebook always had a laptop pc,but this works for me just great,price is good as well",0
Great size considering what it has packed inside .69 inches thick x 14” wide x 10” deep,0
"(Buena, pero no tanto): Las especificaciones son buenísimas, no sé traba y corre bien algunos juegos. Pero la calidad de los materiales de construcción es pésima. Justifica su precio",0
"(Mid-range price but high-end performance): I'm not a gamer - let's get that out there right off the bat. I have no idea if this laptop would suit gamers, but as a teacher who uses MS Office, Google Apps for education, and Zoom extensively, this laptop is great. I also use a few molecular modelling and other memory-intensive science apps and have found no issues at all using this device. The display is vibrant and touchscreen is sensitive but not overly so. The touchpad was easy to adapt to (I am primarily a mouse guy) and is a very convenient size. Overall, I really like this machine and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good all-around laptop at a respectable price.",0
"(Don't know how good haven't got in.): Haven't been able to get into program yet, but having someone come to help me. It won't recognize my phone number.",0
(Perfectly functional): Perfectly functional,0
"(Terrible product): I bought this as “Used, Like New”. The screen started flickering immediately. This item will be going back. I cannot speak to new versions of this laptop but do NOT waste your money or time on the used product.",0
it would not allow me to control all four sections of the keyboard independently,0
(Excellent!!): Better than I thought,0
(not good...): NOT GOOD,0
"(Portable,Light and Battery LASTS. ??MyMac?): Love my new Mac ! It’s very light, battery lasts a long time. Days even - with light use. Charges quickly too. I haven’t bought a case yet - it’s too gorgeous to cover up! But will buy a sleeve for transporting when I travel. No complaints. LOVE IT.",0
(Mala): No prendió al día siguiente de recibirlo. Pero esta bonito el equipo.,0
Screen scratches easy if you are not careful,0
"(Not reliable): For starters this was a warehouse deals. Always know that they're hit or miss. This laptop seemed great at first. Booted up. Went through the setup process. So good. Did the updates. No issues. Then I noticed internet speeds slow. Weird. Forced 5ghz. Speeds up. Then wifi died. Weird. Turn off laptop. Power button to turn on no response. Tried again next day, nothing. 3rd day powers on but wifi still not working so I say ok time to send this back after I do a factory reset. Factory reset not working glitch in windows 11. Downloaded a USB win11 imagine to do a fresh install but it wouldn't find the storage. Had to load the driver manually what a pain.",0
"(Decent Work Computer): The Dynabook (which once upon a time was Toshiba) Satellite Pro is an adequate notebook. In this review, I’m comparing it to my a HP probook x360 435 g7, which is about $100 more. The HP at 250 GB has half the gigs of memory, half the Ram (8 GB vs 16) and 2.7 GHZ vs 2.8 GHZ.What I like:-Big 15.6 inch HD screen. BIG-The bezel around the screen is fairly thin. The screen is not edge to edge screen, but I don’t really see many laptops with that kind display.-matte display. No glare from lights.-Good amount of RAM (16 gb) and hard drive memory.-There is an integrated numeric pad on the right-hand side. I won’t usually use something like that, but if you’re a numbers nerd (and you have my admiration if you are), then the pad should come in handy.-it’s reasonably light (3.96 pounds) for a 15.6inch laptop. It can be used for commuting and on the go.-responsive keyboard. It doesn’t require pushing down hard and it has a satisfying “click” sound.- Ports, ports everywhere! There is an HDMI port, USB-A 3.1 port, and a USB-C 3.1 port on the left side. On the right, there’s a microSD card reader, a USB-A port, a Gigabit Ethernet port, and a 3.5mm audio jack. It also supports WiFi 5 and BlueTooth 5.0. It’s a good amount of connectivity.-I haven’t confirmed this by trying it out, but the notebook can be powered either by the included proprietary Dynabook power supply or by a universal type C USB power supply (minimum 45 watts).What I don’t like:-The plastic casing. Ugh. I think at this price point they could have used aluminum. But not a deal breaker-No touch screen. I don’t necessarily expect this at this price point, but I’ve had cheaper laptops with touch screens. Again, not a deal breaker.-Keyboard feels cheap. It isn’t as substantial as my HP probook.-No keyboard backlighting. This is a real problem for me. At this price point, I expect backlighting. Could be a deal breaker depending on who you are. My HP probook has backlighting, and at about $100 more (less memory), it is important enough that I would go with the Probook instead.-touchpad not so responsive. I don’t like how hard you have to push to right click or other similar actions. The clicking difficulty gets old fast. This is where I would have to have a mouse so I don’t throw the laptop against the wall in frustration.-Not as super-fast as I would expect. When I did a “test your internet speed. My other laptop, a HP probook x360 435 g7, that runs about $100 more had a download speed of 430 mbps. The Dynabook ran a download speed of 350, despite having a faster processor.-The sound is a bit tinny and not very loud, not as robust as I think it should be.-If you try to use headphones, you have to manually go in and tell it to use headphones as the sound source. Then when you want to use the onboard speakers, you have to go switch it. There is no automatic switching of sources. That is pretty annoying.-The same thing with the microphone as with the headphones. You will have to switch mic sources manually. There are no auto switches. Again annoying.-The touch pad sometimes catches and I have to push it down again to make it click back out.Overall, it's a pretty good computer, but I have to be honest, for the price I expect a backlighted keyboard and a more responsive touch pad.",0
"(Excellent Resolution): This XPS Laptop is great. There are a lot of features I like, the size & so lightweight, the screen goes from edge to edge without any border, one of my favorite things is the resolution. I wanted it be be clear and sharp and it is, the high resolution is wonderful. The only thing I didn't know it had was a Type C port, but not a big think just bought a bluetooth mouse. So can't think of anything I don't like!!",0
"(Wouldnt buy again.): My number keys went out just when I hit the 1 yr warranty mark. Lenovo said they only offer 1 yr warranty on items sold through Amazon, so they wouldnt repair it. Its a common issue needing the hardware serviced. I was surprised to see so many similar complaints on a pricey electronic, that the manufacturer wouldnt resolve 1 day after the year mark. -There was also a different date they had registered in their system for the purchase date, but passing the actual 1 yr receipt, they were not going to assist with the repair.",0
"(Cumple por el precio): No es para juegos, su gpu es muy pobre apenas corre Alan wake a 720p con gráficos bajos a 35fps. De Slim no tiene nada, es más pesada de lo esperado. Lo único que lo salva es el procesador que para lo que la usaré cumple. Parece ser que el sentimiento de tener un procesador de última generación es lo agradable",0
(Definitely worth spending money on): I love the performance of this computer,0
(Awesome): It is nice,0
"The device offers interactive tutorials that guide you step-by-step on the touchscreen, simplifying the learning curve.",1
(Great value for the price): I have no major complaints about this device. It is great quality for the price.,0
When I received my laptop the seal on the box was cut,0
"(Processor not very powerful): So its really grating that products such as this do not list the BASE processing speed. If it automatically ""boosts"" when u start up a game, it only makes it so you can technically run that game. It takes a while to load it up (we are talking just sims 3 here too!) and fps is 30 max. Idk the actual base ghz but others have said 1.0 something. Cant do anything with that. Just using the internet is slow as well. Just because all the pieces are there, doesnt mean they actually cohesively work together. It seemed like such a cool laptop but just wasnt working very well.",0
"(Amazing computer): Computer is great very happy about my purchase, worth the money ?% fast, overall amazing, NOW battery wise they really need to improve it ASAPthat’s why I’m giving them 4 star review.",0
(Five Stars): My son loves it he takes it everywhere,0
Cpu and Gpu temps always stayed very cool while pefroming demanding task and gaming.,0
(computer): works good,0
"(Best of the Beast Machine): A computer gamer for life here. I had HP, MAC Pro and recently got this ROG Strix Scar II (NVIDIA RTX 2070). Installed all my gaming platform and video rendering software and I am glad I bought this as my upgrade. Never had a lag. Boot up was fast and my gaming FPS is phenomenal. This is a good investment in terms of your gaming and video (4K) rendering needs. Features and design are sleek and sophisticated. A premium built I would say by the touch and feel. This machine also comes with all the support you need like MYASUS and Game First. It is also light weight compare to my MSI 17"". I am definitely brag and encourage gamers and videographers to invest in this machine. Thanks ASUS for this built!",0
"(A very simple computer, easy to use and convenient): I really love this product so far",0
(Very good): Excellent machine. My biggest concern was it folding flat so I could watch stuff while on my treadmill. Works great!,0
"(Cumplió con todas mis espectativas): Simplemente muy buna, no calienta mucho, lo utilizo para edición de videos pesados desde 4k y no se me ha quedado trabado, trabaja muy bien, su sitema de enfriamiento por ventilación son muy bueno, el audio de calidad, envolvente, no se me a alentado desde el día que lo he comprado, todo funcional, su diseño muy bonito y elegante.",0
(best gaming laptop): support all the new games.,0
"(Surprisingly nice chromebook): Does not act like a tablet, but it can have almost 10 tabs open before affecting performance, including video streaming. The battery seriously lasts as long as I need it, and I'm one to forget to charge it.",0
(Read the advertisement carefully.): It was bigger and heavier than I thought. Couldn’t get Chromebook to work properly as I imagined it would. I returned it.,0
"(“Does not compute”): Hard drive is way to small to be of use. I barely have any software installed and hardly any data stored, and still the antivirus and operating systems fail to download or to install, time and again, because there is not enough disk space for the periodic, automatic updates. In fact, the product description says it is a 128 GB hard drive. but there is actually 244 MB free of 117 GB. That 11 GB below the advertised 128 isn't much, but it would, at least be enough that the product could still function.",0
"(Could not power on after 5 days): I received my notebook 6 days ago.After using it for 5days, it could not charge or turn on anymore. I was shocked and disappointed after spending so much for something faulty.Now I had to spend more to ship it to MSI(US) for repair?! (btw I live in Sweden)",0
(Very happy with one exception!): I love this ease of transferring my data from my old Mac. It is a bit smaller though the screen is the same size so that’s nice. I’m not tech savvy so can’t say much about that aspect. My disappointment is that it doesn’t have a USB port like the old one for charging other devices on the side.,0
(Brand name): I love it. It is. Great meme brand and perfect for google drive,0
"Feels a bit flimsy on the top part if touched hard, and smudges easy",0
"(Bad buy): it heats up really fast, I bought a fan but it still gets hot",0
"(I am very happy with this purchase): I am very happy with this purchase. I will say I first saw them at Best Buy and probably should have gotten it there so I could get some help with a quick start - but, as always, Amazon was $20 less expensive and it was on my doorstep in 2 days. I am figuring it out!",0
"(It's just slow and doesn't have alot of options): Extremely slow! I've had it for 5 months, and it is already broken.",0
"(Great investment): Great value!As amazing as described! Really powerful!Not too heavy, nice lighting and performance!No cons so far.",0
"(Don’t but used/refurbished): I didn’t realize this was used, it is not very good , especially for the amount of money, I bought a new one as well and the price was just about the same, this one the keys don’t work sometimes, it is slow, very slow. It was for my granddaughter and she gets frustrated with it not working line her other four sisters chrome books.",0
"(Defective and lack of support): Product came with a scratch on the screen, and once turned one, didn’t recognize the hard drive. Had to sent 3 emails to the address provided to get an answer, and I got an answer it was: you have to contact Amazon.",0
(going great): Got it a day early working great,0
"(Stay away): Does not run full versions of microsoft office so dont buy that either. Screen quality is junk, as resolution is pretty bad. Thought I would try it out, now lost $250 as I bought microsoft office for it as well. Better to just put $150 towards a better laptop as this is very limited. Cheap price because it is a cheap product.",0
"(Lasted 3.5 years, and then stopped working): In the first year I had this, the network card stopped working and I had to replace it. Then, after a little under 3.5 years, it would not boot up; a capacitor fused to the motherboard went bad, and replacing the whole motherboard it wasn’t an option. The tech guy tells me they see a lot of these models with the same problem after only a few years. Buyer beware …",0
(Screen cracked after a handful of uses): We were excited about this new touchscreen laptop until the screen cracked less than a month after purchase. We were very disappointed in the quality of this product. Our previous HP lasted us years and unfortunately that was not the case with this purchase.,0
(Good): This laptop is not for gaming. The price says all. the wifi was like super fast. if it works for 3-4 years will be awesome,0
"(Great Laptop overall): Overall it is a great laptop with a lot of power on a slim form factor.My previous gaming laptop was an ASUS which weight is 8.2 lbs, so I am very happy with this new very light gaming laptop.Before get into what I like or dislike I want to mention that this laptop gets really hot, but it is something I was expecting and something that doesn't bother me at all, I am just wondering if this is going to be a durable laptop or not due to the heat inside could eventually damage some components. Also I am not going to take as good or bad the battery life since I know the graphic card demands a lot of power when playing games, so I am feeling good overall with the battery performance.What I like:-Screen, it looks amazing, no LCD bleeding that I can complaint-Speed, it is really fast, booting, and loading games-Keyboard, typing experience and steelseries software-I/O has all that you could need, even LAN port-Graphic and Processor Performance-it is noisy but I don't think it is to loud for me.What I dislike-Finger print magnet-lacking of automated drivers update, I have a PC with a MSI mother board, it has the live update software which monitors if there are new driver's version and I decide when to download them and install them, with this laptop there is nothing for that, you have to go to the website and check if there is a new version of any driver and figure it out when was the last time you updated it, so you can compare against the release date.-Sound, sound is not that good, I have an Ipad Pro and it sounds a lot lot better than this laptop-Hardware Upgrade, I like to be able to upgrade the stuff myself, but with this laptop I don't think I am going to upgrade anything (I wanted to add a second SSD) but as you probably know the mother board is flipped so in order to have access to the SSD slot you have to disconnect multiple connectors and I am not willing to do it.-AC Power connector, I think it could be placed closer to a corner and not almost at the middle of the right side.",0
(Modern): Fast!,0
(Super pratique pour un usage simple!): J'adore ce petit laptop. compact et très pratique!,0

Heat becomes a problem very quickly when running a demanding game.,0
(Sensitive Screen): The screen stopped working within a week of delivery.,0
"(Awful computer): I'm pretty sure this computer was a refurbished item and wasn't labelled as such. Kept shutting down, screen would either freeze or go completely blank. Wiped out my daughter's entire school project. Do not buy...product suckedNo battery life....",0
"(Frustratingly Slow): Laptop is very slow. Even before adding basic programs for school, its frustrating just to wait for it to boot up!",0
It includes Windows 10 and was so easy to set up.,0
The laptop has a high-end processor and dedicated graphics,0
(Great laptop and value): Like everything about this laptop,0
(Versatile computer): I've been using lenovo for more than 5 years now and I just keep getting amazed as to how great these machines are built. The legion is a work horse. I've been running premier and light room on it and no complaints on my end. I would recomend for anyone who needs a gaming and work computer.,0
"(Nice upgrade from 2017 MB Pro): I bought this base model Macbook air M2 to replace a 2017 Macbook Pro 13"" with an Intel i5 2.3 and it is somewhat snappier in performance. Menus and webpages open faster. The keyboard has a better feel to it than my 2017 MB Pro. The magsafe charge connector is far better than usb c. The finger print reader is a bonus for logging into APPS and websites. I bought the Starlight colour and glad I did. For those of you who said in your review that you bought startlight colour Mac but got a silver one....you probably got startlight colour. It's very hard to see that there is a hint of gold in the colour until you sit it beside a silver Mac. I bought the base model with 8gb ram and 256 gb HDD because the bulk of my use is web surfing and I don't store many photos or videos on my Mac. Battery life is a lot longer than my 2017 Intel i5 MB Pro. When using this Macbook Air M2 for web surfing, the battery dropped only 10% after 1.5 hours. Overall I'm happy with this MB Air M2 and would recommend this base model for the average user. Buy yourself a nice sleeve or other accessory with the money you save by buying the base vs upgraded M2 Air.",0
(Very pleased): Gaming is not my first use for this notebook. I wanted good performance and still have some resemblance of battery life. This is nicely sized notebook that travels well and covers both my professional and personal needs.,0
(Good value): Great screen and lightweight. Works well and a good value for everyday use. I would buy another.,0
"(Don't buy this): To small,very slow",0
(I love it!!!): Excellent and perfect.,0
(Five Stars): Good,0
"(Super small, powerful laptop): I use an XPS 17 as my workstation. For going places though, this super small laptop can do everything I need. It has 2 Thunderbolt 4 ports (USB C) and a micro-SD card reader. I use the reader with a 1TB micro-SD to store all my reference files. This makes the 512GB SSD more than adequate. My XPS 13 has 16GB ram which is more than enough for the purposes for which I use this machine. My only wish is if one had a 5G option so I would have to use a Hot Spot connection. The 1920x1200 display resolution is perfect. The XPS 13 is too small to really use 4K properly and battery life on 4K laptops is significantly less than these HD+ machines.",0
(Better than a Mac!): It is a great chromebook. Very happy with it ! Don't know why people still buy Mac !!!! This one is cheaper and better.,0
"(Keyboard backlight not working): The keyboard backlight isn't working, the customer service made me wait for more than 1 hour with no solution at the end, frustrating experience.",0
(Littel Cheap.): Material is cheap.,0
"(Great product and core specs for the price, (about 4 years since I have it.)): Bought this 4 years ago for gaming, school and work. It still works well and only degradation is the plastic air intake gill in the front right corner, that I most likely broke handling my pc by that single corner. Am now looking into upgrading/adding another ram stick, since I have the option and feel like I need more ram. As well as looking into 2nd external monitor option, although I read it supposedly supports 2 monitors, it seems for the second monitor support I need a different cable connection, mini port - which might be an issue. I ordered this after doing a 12 hour research, since I didn't know much about pc's and their components, must say this was the best money could buy for my needs back then. When buying a pc I considered I should make do with 2 drawbacks, judging from the feedback I read on forums discussing pc's. So in the end, with the budget I allocated for this, I choose sound (speakers) and battery life to be the drawbacks (instead 50%+ price tag or sacrificing other specs). In the end I didn't even notice these ""drawbacks"" as I use external speakers or headset and mostly use my pc while plugged in. I have heard people often complain about battery life and speaker quality on many pc reviews, I think that its rather odd to expect a pc to run high resource demanding games on battery power. About speakers I don't know, is it the cost or the space that impacts the quality, but it doesn't matter to me as long as its decent. If i need something better, just plug in or connect proper audio devices. Also I don't use camera much, but its okay.",0
(Great little computer): It's great!,0
(System power failure after only 7 months.): Purchased September 2020. The graphics card would crash and force a restarts. Stopped powering on via battery or power cable May 2021. Sent it back for repairs and when it returned the sound card doesn’t work and now windows will not boot.,0
"(decent laptop - HORRIBLE power supply): The laptop is good and what you would expect for $300, no complaints there. But the power connection is like a micro microphone connection and is very fragile. We have 3 of these laptops, purchased 4 months ago and all 3 have issues; one power connector broke in half.",0
"(ASUS ZENBOOK): Slim and Lightweight, soft touch and back-lit keyboard, non reflective screen..I love everything about this Zenbook and rate it the best laptop I have purchased after all these years!",0
(good quality): Very happy with this purchase. Laptop runs smooth quite and cool even on demanding games. very pleased,0
"(Love ASUS solid state computers): I had bought my both my sons Solid state asus laptops 4 years ago, they were both over spec'ed but are still perfect for college and high school work respectively. The design means they are thin, light and boot and respond quickly. This computer is of course light years beyond theirs and I have to say I am loving it. the flexibility of going from a tablet to a laptop to attaching it to a 24"" monitor to use at a desk is just almost beyond my belief. Since my first computer was a brand new Apple II and my second was 6 Mhz all big blue IBM AT, and had so many in between that I have lost count it is remarkable when I say, I will remember this one for a long time.",0
"(LIFELONG APPLE USER: Amazing Laptop, Not Great Speaker 9.9/10): I've ALWAYS had Macs and have never considered PC's till my Macbook died. I then bought an HP with better specs than this laptop, and am returning the HP because this MSI laptop is just that much better. I've only had this laptop for 2 weeks and so far it's worth every penny. I don't use it for gaming but the CPU speed is amazing, everything is quick. I use Ableton for Music Production and require a laptop that can process tons of different moving parts at the same time. Ableton is running better than ever on this, I haven't had any CPU crashes or overloads whatsoever. The only reason this isn't the perfect laptop for me is the speaker. The laptop's speaker quality is very mediocre. Granted, the laptop audio quality is stellar. When plugged into headphones or other speakers, it sounds great. I just wish the speakers on the laptop gave a better quality sound. Nonetheless, it's worth it.",0
Some units have more backlight bleed,0
"(SO FAR SO-SO): This laptop was purchased to replace one purchased in 2013. I was not unhappy with my 8+ year old machine, but disk access had slowed down with fragmentation, and the battery needed replacement. The attraction of SSD and price made a device change the only rational choice.I found removal of current files from one device to the other unreasonably unaddressed in the product supporting materials, or in the guidance I sought from the most prominent purveyors of system and communications software. I am still in the transfer process. This is disappointing.",0
(What he tells me): My sons schooling and gaming,0
(Do not buy!!!): Haven't even had this laptop for 9 months and have used it maybe once every 2 weeks and several of the keys have stopped working.,0
(Battery): I think the battery is not working properly. It discharge very quickly,0
this replacement unit has way more backlight bleeding than the previous one,0
"(Fast and beautiful screen): I got the 14"" i7 16gb 512ssd and has beautiful screen and super fast. The touchpad is like a smartphone but i just turned it off to use cursor. Downgraded from 90ghtz to 60ghtz for more battery but its still fast and smooth browsing. Overall nice laptop for 1200. I didnt buy for gaming but for my new job as realtor. Office use. Will buy a 27"" display later. Lots of ports to connect anything and has a webcam.",0
(Sold broken laptop): I didn't want to complain about it but I got sold a broken laptop and I didn't pay it to much mind cause I just need a new more capable laptop but now I look at it and it cause me more and more problems when I open it I just wish I would have gotten a brand new not broken laptop that was pawned off on me,0

"(Samsung Chromebook - just what I needed): I purchased the 32-bit Samsung Chromebook 3. I wanted a Samsung unit to go with my Note 3, Note 4 and must recent purchase a Note 8. What great machine.. all for under $200! I charged it up and downloaded the OS update. I’m impressed with the speed, weight, and quality of this product. The fact that isn’t touch is okay with me. The mouse pad is very responsive and easy to use. I like the non-reflective screen, the screen brightness control makes easy to read in daylight. Instant startup is a joy. The USB 3 and second ports USB 2 and HDMI with the longest battery-life are what sold me. I wrote this review with the unit. Impressive, I'm a CHROME fan for sure. My favorite Play Store app - ISS HD Live.",0
"(Good for the price): The screen resolution is not ideal, and the touch pad can be just a little wonky, but over all I love it and use it often. For the price, a great deal.",0
"(A sleek powerhouse): This laptop is a beast. On Turbo it is loud, but on performance it's quiet even if being pushed relatively hard. and if Asus Armoury Crate to be believed, the heat is fine. It is also CERTAINLY not hot. Compared to some real furnaces that would burn my hand I've had in the past, this is nothing.I have this as a desktop replacement and for the money, this thing is definitely future proofed. 3070TI, with a 12th Gen I9, is a great combo.It does do some funky things on battery though. I would avoid purchasing this for travel.Very happy with my purchase. And this is upgradeable. I can put another SSD, or another stick of ram in it no sweat.On the topic of Ram, 16GB gets eaten up REAL fast Even though it's DDR5.Great laptop!!!!",0
"(Caveat Emptor....BUYER BEWARE): This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought for a computer. NO RIGHT CLICK button, makes you have to use hybrid screen touch and keypad with inconsistent pattern. No ethernet port and insufficient usb ports given it has No DVD either. Do Not Waste your money on this, there are way better laptops cheaper.",0
Sound is terrible default driver is a Nahimic version which does not allow you to raise use enhancements on audio which the default driver provides the worst sounding audio possible,0
(Bad sound: camera not working): I bought this about 6 months ago. The first thing to go bad was the sound - so low I couldn't hear. Lots of complaints on google. I had to plug in external speakers.Then the camera started to go. After hours of diagnosing I was told by Acer to send in my computer and they could fix . . . wait - send my computer away somewhere with all my bank and credit card info for close to two weeks? I bought a web cam. So now my new computer is a Frankenstein with all kinds of wires and attachments sticking out. Wish I would have known. Now you do.,0
"(Very good product, light for the performance): Love this machine, the only critic is that it is not a light gaming machine. Graphs and power are there for gaming, but the video board is a power hungry beast and it will suck all the juice in a couple of hours. But if you are not planning to game based on battery and for everything else, this machine is incredible.",0
"(Support Ends August 2021): I love Chromebooks, but recently found out that every one of them has an expiration date beyond which it will no longer be supported with updates. That's understandable, but it is inexcusable that this date is not included in the product specs. I bought this particular Chromebook for my dad in January 2019, and if I'd known about the expiration date being August 2021, I definitely would have chosen a different Chromebook. Unfortunately, the only way to find out a Chromebook's Auto Update Expiration (AUE) is to check the Auto Update Policy page on the google support site, and even then they don't make it easy. There are some Chromebooks on Amazon that I could not find on that list, so who knows when they expire. Beware!!!",0
"(Noise): I ordered a few days ago, and so far haven't noticed anything wrong, except for the noise. It claims on Amazon that you can change the volume/performance by pressing Fn+F, but I've tried doing so many times, and it does nothing. And from what I've heard it isn't working for anyone else either.",0
"(Crashed): Crashed within weeks, can't seem to get ahold of any type of service support.",0
(Excelente): Liviana,0
(Absolutley Terrible): On the rare occasion I can get the thing to turn on. It takes 15 minutes to warm up.Using the internet is painfully slow. Even being the only device connected to my router. With 150 Mbps. (I intenetspeedtest.com'd it from another device.) it absolutely crawls.I cannot have more than about 2 tabs open in a browser at any time or the system starts spinning and the computer becomes useless.My son bought these for myself and his assistant to use and we cant even use them.Waste of money,0
"(Very Sleek!): The Computer is awesome, Microsoft not so awesome. Any complaints I have regarding the running of the computer are because the program running on it has issues.",0
(Five Stars): Superior to my previous Chromebook. I love it!,0
"(Sleek, modern, blazing fast!): Take everything from the M1 MacBook Air, make it lighter, slimmer, with a better camera, more screen real estate along with a magsafe charger & incredibly faster M2 chip, all in a less volume package than it's predecessor. That's the 2022 M2 MacBook Air. 5/5 ??????????",0
(Best Laptop I Ever Owned): It can run most of my games pretty fast. I hope to continue to try Acer’s products.,0
"(Amazing laptop): Unexpectedly this turned out to be a espectacular laptop. Yes, some applications are still not available natively for the M1 chip but even through emulation they are very fast to use. Camera despite having the same.720p res it has a better image quality and I assume this is due to the chip processing image better than intel. For everyday use this is perfect for other tasks such as programming not yet.",0
(Super cute.): Perfect for my 10yr old niece. It's small and only intended for web browsing.,0
(Love this lap top): Love love love love it,0
"(Great until it died): Ordered August 16, 2019 for school. The computer was meeting my needs and working great until September 26, 2019. It would not turn on, then I plugged in and the charge light was on, but only momentarily, the light no longer indicates a charge, the battery is hot despite being charged. I tried several outlets, unplugging to let the battery cool, but nothing seems to be working. Just over 30 days and it's dead :( I have contacted seller through Amazon to see how we can fix the problem.I will say that before it stopped working, the screen was great, battery life was good lasting a day of use at school, keys were easy to use, and the speed of the operating system was sufficient for my needs as a law student. I hope there's a remedy for my laptop, I need it back asap.",0
"(Good buy): Good buy. Got it for my wife, who needed a new computer for an online class but didn’t use a computer enough to warrant a PC. Works well, has good screen resolution, and a long battery life.",0
"(Great machine, no battery life.): This laptop, out of the box, trumps my 3yo desktop, that I so lovingly built.It has some issues. Namely, it runs hot.Get a cooling stand. Don't expect to use this on battery power for more than an hour. Way less if you do something graphics intensive. This is, for all intents and purposes, a portable lower end gaming desktop. The specs are really great for a mid-range gaming laptop. It's run everything I've thrown at it, and it's heaven benchmark on extreme was around 1200.It's a great, very light weight machine. It's so power hungry though. If you need portable, but always have the ability to plug in, this is exactly what you need.I'd invest in a bag for a 17 inch laptop however, because it's still larger than a standard 15.6""",0
"(Fast and Easy): Fell in love with the chromebook. Was a little skeptical about the CLOUD thing, but there's no question that it gets online quicker. Operating System being designed around the browser or vice-versa is an excellent idea.",0
(ecellent memory manaement and 5G wireless): I bought this device because of the 5G Wireless interface coupled with excellent memory support and superior storage. wonderful price/benefit ratio.,0
(Great buy): Exactly what it is advertised as.,0
(This laptop has exceeded my expectations.): This laptop has exceeded my expectation and has taken my video editing Capabilities to another level.,0
"(Defective Wireless Card): This laptop worked for just under a month, and then the wireless card gave out. All of my devices, including my 4 year old HP Envy laptop are connecting just fine to my network. I've restarted, run diagnostics, and still nothing. It continues to say there are no networks available, which means that the wireless card isn't working, at all. It's not even finding other local networks let alone mine. Since this thing doesn't have an Ethernet cable port, it's useless now since I can't connect to the internet with it. Returned.",0
"(Amazing value, speed, and power): I travel a ton for work, but cannot always use my work laptop for things like shopping and games. This notebook is lightweight, boots up super fast, and has not bogged or slowed at any number of task I have thrown at it. I have played some online games while listening to music and browsing facebook and there were no signs of slowing or issues. It was surprisingly tough and the battery has lasted me for 2 full days of use. From a toughness standpoint, I'll admit, I dropped it out of a laptop bag and it did quite well with only minimal damage so that was very impressive. I have added some storage space via HDD and found it very easy to do with minimal tools. The Bluetooth works very well, as well - have used this for movies on the plane ride and it worked flawlessly. This is a great general use laptop and I would highly recommend it.",0
"(Not impressed , the damn thing quit working): Used for personal use , well , I wanted to and like I said , the damn thing quit working , won't power on or anything , not happy at all",0
I found that it doesn't support 5g wifi.,0

"(this is amazing. The fan is an amazing detail on it): This computer is a beast.If anyone needs a computer that can run overwatch at high settings with almost 80 fps, this is for you. I'm sure turning stuff down will make the frames higher. After coming from a computer that ran on the lowest settings at 20 fps, this is amazing.The fan is an amazing detail on it. It'll cool the computer down immediately. So t hats a huge plus. Also the matte screen is a blessing too. From a person who wears glasses it's perfect. You don't get the extra glare from the screen.",0
The power brick is huge,0
(Very high specs with a corresponding price): This laptop is a beast when it comes to specs and running regular and VR games. If you are not a gamer this is not your preferred choice.One con though - it is pretty loud/noisy when using a heave app or game. If you have gamer's headphones you won't hear it anyway.,0
"(One Star): I am very disappointed, and would like my money returned.",0
"(The keys don’t always work.): My son uses it for school and it works well for that purpose. The battery life is great. He has been using it for 3 months and it just started having an issue, the issue is the R, T , Y doesn’t always work which is a huge problem. Fortunately each time it happened it did finally work but I’m sure this is just the beginning of a bigger problem.",0

Not problems yet and I will problem I will report.",0
"(No camera and touch pad issues): No camera from the start but problems have increased since thenTouch pad works off and on and now as laptop warms up, laptop freezes up and there is no response. Have called service and put on hold. What good is customer service and Warranty service if product fails just out of the box. If this is AMD products I will go back3/28/21 - update after several updates and several phone calls to Amazon who have been more than helpful.. the computer is working ok with the exception of the camera that works but is so blurry it cant be used.. will keep you updated",0
"(For 400 dollars it will suffice.): A Very mediocre machine, you are paying 400 dollars for it. I bought it for my niece for school. No gaming, no advanced editing or engineering work.

(Laptop): I bought this as a gift for a new college student. I only worked with it to see if it was OK.I'll let everyone know if my granddaughter has problems.Seems OK for the money. Not the fastest but for college work OK.I have had several Acer Laptops and they were all good. Never any problems.One I gave away to my other granddaughter from 2011 is still running OK but slow.In fact my current laptop is an Acer Aspire E15 which works fast and no problems.(2018 model from Amazon),0
"(Fantastic!): It's been many years since I allowed myself a new laptop, and as I usually go for a lightly used older model I'm fairly easy to please, and hardly the harshest critic of the most up to date technology.That said, the moment I pulled this laptop from its box I was in love. At a little over 1KG it's incredibly light, though because it's less than 12"" wide and 8"" deep that weight is quite concentrated. It feels dense in a way that no laptop I've ever used has felt, a hint that lots of exciting technology has been crammed into this tiny package.I don't do much intensive work day to day, but every few weeks I need to fire up Photoshop to do some fairly complex stuff that absolutely annihilates my old laptop. With 16GB of RAM and the Intel Iris Xe Graphics card this thing can stroll through the kind of work that would cause my old laptop to grind to a halt. What's more I can keep multiple processes working in the background while I work, so graphics work is no longer a grind.If you're looking for a small and extremely portable laptop that can handle anything you can throw at it, the Dell XPS 13 9310 is an excellent candidate. Yes, it's expensive, and I'm sure you can get a laptop with similar specs in a slightly less portable package for less, but I've never used a laptop with this much power that's small enough to toss in a tote bag. My only slight complaint is that it runs a little hot when you start to push it, because the heat needs to go somewhere and there just isn't enough room to dissipate it effectively. It's not enough to knock this down from a 5 star review, though. Just buy a cooling pad or raise it off the surface.",0
"(Worth it): This laptop is, probably the best pc equipment other than a desktop that I have purchased, really reliable, great keyboard that lights up. Have been using it to play my favorite strategy games like age of empires and work at home.",0
I got a huge discount on this product on Prime Day.,0
"Received the order in a timely manner, the packaging for the product looked elegant and well-thought out",0
(Best bang for your buck gaming laptop): I bought this laptop mainly for gaming about 3 weeks ago and after several weeks of research I came to the conclusion that this is by far the best bang for my buck for the steal price of $1400. I'm absolutely inlove with the amount of customization I can do with the CPU boost speeds to get the perfect balance of speeds and temps. It does run a little hot but with a small undervolt that quickly fixed my issues. I'm currently getting around 90-110fps on escape from tarkov and COD MW (2019) with maxed settings without going above 85degrees on the cpu. Battery life is around 1-4 hours depending on what I'm doing which is expected it's got a full rtx 2070 mobile and a 10750h. Keyboard is very nice to work with as well. I do have a little bit of screen bleeding which is only noticable on black loading screens which isn't a issue for me. Sorry this review is all over the place but this is a great buy for the price I don't care what anyone says.,0
(Great value for money): Great value for money - this was A$236 including delivery. These run Android apps and linux apps.,0
"(Good product but beware of the camrera): I'm a mac guy and have been purchasing mac products for years. I was taken back by the camera quality on this product. It was strange that the 2015 macbook air that I sold before getting this 2020 version had a much better camera. The camera quality is horrible. It almost looks like a camera from 2001. Other than that the product is great, and does what it needs to do.",0

(Great Tool): Nice chromebook. Really helpful tool for Dungeons and Dragons 😂,0
(Wife isn't tech savvy person and she loves it): My wife is not a tech savvy person and she loves this computer. She is able to use it without too much help. She uses this machine to get online to the bank and pay bills--anything that she won't use her phone for. It is a good deal.,0

"(Love it, although I am not a fan of ...): Love it, although I am not a fan of Windows 10. Also it comes with Microsoft Edge and the default browser and I hate Edge. I have to figure out how to make Outlook my default. Other than that, the laptop works great. No issues.",0
(everything): it was very nice just did not need it after all.,0
"(Coil whine (Static noise)): It's a great laptop except for one thing. Coil whine. I've tried updating my bios, gpu, chipset, and other drivers but it still sounds like there is a loud mechanical hard drive inside. Besides that though it is a great laptop. I still haven't used it long enough to tell how good the battery life is but so far that is the least of my worries.Update: Ended up returning the previous laptop and purchasing another hoping that it wouldn't also have coil whine but IT DOES. It also seems to have trouble connecting to wifi, especially 5 ghz, it connects for a bit then it stops. I've tried updating every driver and bios and both problems still persist.Update 2: I used a program called ThrottleStop to disable the Turbo Boost and the loud mechanical hard drive noise is gone. network problems on the other hand are still an issue and may need to get the wireless adapter card replaced.",0
(Great Value): Great buy! Best computer I’ve owned to date.,0
(Great PC): Make sure you get the one with the 3060 or higher graphics card. I have the 3060 card in mine and it runs just about every game I want it to on the highest settings with minimal to no lag or skipping.,0
(Great purchase): Packaging was secure and the laptop was new and in mint condition. Performance thus far is excellent. No complaints,0
(Decent laptop for the price): it's a decent laptop for the price. it's not slow and the screen is good.the storage isn't the best so if you'll need a lot of large programs (like adobe) then id opt for something more high-end. but if you're a student then it should be fine,0
(I received it in good Time with no problems): When I first got the laptop I thought I had ordered a 16GB RAM machine but it only had 8 GB installed. I went back on the Amazon site and checked. I apparently need to read a little slower when ordering. The laptop works fine and I REALLY like the backlit keyboard.I did have a moment of panic when I turned the laptop on and had NO backlit keyboard!! .....Was just getting ready to put it back in box and send it back when I noticed one of the Fn keys had a screen icon associated with it. What the hell.. so I pressed it and SHAZAMM.... I had a backlit keyboard.Now I am a happy camper and enjoying my HP laptop very much... 95% of my computer equipment in my office is HP and they have worked great.Jim DouglassFinney County Kansas,0
"(Great entry lv gaming laptop. Runs hot though.): The Nitro 5 feels like a quality laptop. It feels perfect for a slightly above entry level gaming laptop. The only complaint and why I didn't give it 5 stars, is it runs pretty hot. I recently replaced the stock thermal paste with high quality paste meant to handle even extreme setups. It brought the cpu temp down about 8°. Diablo 3, The Witcher 3, FFXIV, etc.. All runs at a decent temp on higher settings. FFXV turns my Nitro into a supernova at medium settings even with the new thermal paste (will frequently spike to 93°-96°). Other than that it'll play any new game on the market at medium graphics with a decent fps and it'll play most games at medium to max settings at a good fps. I'd recommend replacing the stock thermal paste asap.All in all, for the price I would highly recommend this laptop. Just don't expect to be playing something like Cyberpunk higher than medium with anything higher than 30-40 fps.",0

"(Something Fishy): Wanted to upgrade from previous version after donating the old one to my younger brother. Went with the 4gb version with dual cores. DOA in an very odd way. Whoever logs into a Chromebook first it recognizes as its owner. Well the first account to log in works for about 120 seconds then starts flashing screen off and on before rebooting and bringing you to log in screen. Add new user, works perfectly fine. Quite snappy and brilliant display. Try to go back to owner log in and you get instant screen blink in and out, 4 - 6 cycles and then reboot and log in screen.I thought it was a glitch in the Google settings so we tried multiple accounts logging in first and same thing everytime. Powerwashing unit by secondary user and trying again. I have a family of 5 and I know everyones log in information so i tried them all. Every user after the first would wotk fine, first on the machine and it is utteraly un-usable.I gave it 2 stars because a D.O.A. computer is not unheard of but this is clearly not shipping damage. Something in the build is wrong.Went to the ACER for a little more but I am not happy to have to give up the Micro SD Slot this one has. That is the reason it did not get 1 star.",0

"(Good): Nice performance, nice weight, good battery life. But why put the power button at the worst spot? You will accidentally turn it off ALL the time.",0
"(Not good, twice.): (Updated review at the end.)I've had this laptop for eleven days and I ordered a replacement two days ago, and now I'm very glad I did. Three days ago, the screen started having glitches, videos/pictures moving from left to right rapidly, the very top of the screen starting to lose pixels (I don't know if that's the correct terminology.) I tried to restart the computer and the power button in the start menu said ""There are currently no power options available."" I still have no idea what that means and I've /never/ had a computer do that before (I also couldn't find any helpful information on how to fix that, so I had to hard restart my computer.) I hadn't had too many problems, still occasionally pictures/videos moving, until tonight when the screen mirrored in half horizontally and over the course of a minute started fading into a completely white screen, while the video I was watching continued to play with no audio problems. I did another hard restart and it's currently working while I type this, but as a full-time college student I can't afford to have a laptop that might unexpectedly crash on me. Not to mention anyone who spends $400 on something expects it to work properly. I'm giving it a second chance, understanding that this could just be one damaged computer, and will update the review either way--but I'm extremely disappointed that I have to deal with this.Just under two weeks with the replacement laptop and the exact same problems were happening. I attached a video since I'm not having an easy time explaining what was happening. I thought at first it was the Hulu app causing problems, but I've had no trouble using it on another computer. It would also happen even when I was just doing homework, which caused an unnecessary amount of stress. I've seen enough positive reviews to know it may just be a fluke, but honestly I recommend just spending $100-200 more on another laptop if you have the means. Or there are plenty of cheap laptops at Best Buy and other places that aren't super high quality but shouldn't have glitches and at least you'll have person-to-person access for any possible problems.",0

"(Best Gaming Laptop I've owned): I really am enjoying this laptop so far. The high power limited 3070ti plays all the games I enjoy at 100-140 fps and the screen looks quite good. The speakers are the best I've heard on a gaming laptop so far (although i wish they could be a bit louder.) I upgraded mine from 16 gigs of ram to 32 and the process was pretty close to simple- since there are two ribbon cables connecting to the LED light bar you should be careful of.The keyboard feels good and the touchbar isn't anything specia but isn't a pain to use. Temps weren't amazing, but not super bad either in my experience so far. With a cooling pad under it, and gaming for about 3 hours the gpu hit a max of 81c and the cpu averaged maybe 70-85 depending on the core- with a few spiking to 99c for a few seconds. Idle temps are super good. When doing very light things I rarely ever even notice fan noise and even while gaming its not enough to force you to wear headphones to block the sound out.The only downsides I can think of are the limited BIOS customization options and lack of webcam. Those two things aside, this laptop is a beast and I am super happy that I got mine for a good price",0
"(Worth the price.): For those reading the reviews about screen issues. I can say that I did in fact experience this at first. HOWEVER... I noticed that when using the laptop screen on a shallow angle to the keyboard it was far worse. I corrected this by bringing the screen closer to a 90 degree angle to the keyboard which takes the weight load off the hinge brackets that are anchored to the screen. I do not see any white bleeding from the back light at all anymore around the lower bezel.The laptop is a solid unit. I have the i7 17.7"" 2070 RTX version and it punches through any game I throw at it with no issues. There is always the heat issues that come with gaming laptops but nothing an inexpensive laptop cooling pad can't help with.",0
"(Best Laptop for 1k): After reading multiple reviews on several laptops, and trying my luck on this 5800H 3050 Ti, I'm so happy I made the choice!Plays for fornite at 260-300fps, the display is absolutely crisp as anything I've ever seen.Nothing to complain about with this rig.",0

"(Lives Up To Hype): I purchased the MacBook Air to replace a 4th Gen Surface Pro that was down to about 30 minutes of battery life. I purchased an Intel Mac Mini about six months ago and was intrigued by recent news articles regarding the M1 chip. I'm thrilled with the added battery life on the new device and amazed by the speed difference between my Intel-based mini vs. the M1. Out of the box, adding a full charge, the new Mac estimates 19+ hours of battery life. I've been using the computer for three hours, four open apps, and have bumped the battery gauge to 98%. Think I've eliminated battery anxiety. App launches are two to three times faster on the Air vs. my Mini. The new laptop is zippy! I'm thrilled with my new laptop and look forward to many years together.",0

"(Great budget gaming laptop w room to upgrade.): If you are looking for a budget friendly gaming laptop for mobile gaming I suggest giving this laptop a try and at $1,800 I’d say it’s a great steal because it’s a great tool for everyday use school and work for both light and heavy use that use a new storage option called an M.2 that loads data faster than traditional Solid State Drives (SSDs) which are already fast but suggest upgrading the 512Gb M.2 SSD to a Samsung 1Tb M.2 NVME and add a traditional SSD in the unused storage bay and add a 16Gb laptop RAM stick to maximize potential of this beauty oh and to transfer the m.2 512Gb SSD to a Samsung m.2 1Tb will need free online software to transfer the operating system and all files needed to function properly for specific ASUS ROG files and functions. I hope I helped! ^ w ~",0
I am thankful that Xidu is sending me a mouse because I am terrible with pads.,0
"(Great specs for the price with average build qualith and a poor screen): I own an Asus G20 desktop and Asus PG279Q monitor from their ROG line. Both of which are solid performers - great quality, design, and build. I have also been a Mac user for decades and my go to everyday computer is a MacBook Pro. For work, I have a Lenovo X1 Carbon. All three I have no qualms in terms of what they offer and how they are built.Being a fan of Asus, I had I hopes for this M580VD-EB76 ViVoBook Pro. On paper the specs are top notch:- 2.8GHz Processor (Turbo up to 3.8GHz)- nVidia GTX 1050 graphics processor with 4GB DDR4 RAM- 256GB SATA3 M.2 SSD main hard drive- 1TB HDD secondary hard drive- Harman/Kardon audio- Multiple ports - USB 3.1, USB 3.0, USB 2.0, Headphone/Audio-in combo, HDMI 1.4, SDXC card readerThis is definitely more than a home/work computer as it's capable of avid gaming just short of fully meeting VR gaming specs.PROS:The Harman/Kardon audio is a win. It doesn't replace external speakers, but it's one of the best one's I've heard for one built into a laptop.The Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor doesn't hold back in performance unlike those specifically made for laptops.The nVidia GTX 1050 4GB graphics processor I can't complain although a GTX 1060 would have been ideal to meet VR gaming needs.SATA3 M.2 SSD cards plus additional traditional hard drive combo is the norm these days for primary and secondary storage.The ingenious wired Ethernet port design without having the need to purchase a USB to Ethernet adapter is definitely a great pro feature for this laptop.The keyboard has a great feel to it and is very quiet when typing.CONS:The keyboard feels too crammed I find myself pressing the nearby keys more often. And while the number pad is a good addition, again the crammed keys make me mis-press than what I have intended.The screen is a very poor performer. The colours are washed out and not vibrant. The anti-glare screen is giving me glare that I find myself having to adjust the angle all of the time. I'm definitely not loving the performance of this FHD with a TN panel. I wish Asus went IPS as adjustment from glare and the fact that you have a narrow viewing angle before it gets washed out.All I get is brightness without vibrance.Also the black bars on each side of the screen is too thick it makes this laptop look dated. Asus could have easily shaved an inch in width from this laptop so I wonder why they continued with this design especially having a crammed keyboard when there is still so much width to play around with doesn't make sense. It appears more of a cost issue than to retool their equipment.Opening the lid isn't a smooth feature. Unlike Macs where you can simply lift the lid open, the main body doesn't lift up. With this Asus, you have to hold your hand down on the main body as it will lift up together when opening the lid. Not exactly a good pro design.For a VivoBook Pro notebook, having been provided Windows 10 Home instead of Pro is a big miss.The trackpad isn't also a stellar performer. It's not as sensitive as I am used to from other laptops including MacBooks.Like all manufacturers there are too many bloatware installed. Even after set up, the Asus software gives you a chance to install even more ""recommended"" free software.Finally the metal body feels cheaply made unlike the metal feel of a Mac. With the Asus it feels thin that I have to double guess if it's plastic than aluminum. So while the lid and body are metal, the underbody is disappointingly plastic. The feel is completely different and feels like another shortcut in cost and quality.OVERALLFor what it is and the price, you really can't complain. But for a manufacturer like Asus I would have expected a whole lot more in terms of quality of components and materials as well as design.The box of this laptop bills itself as a VivoBook Pro, but I don't quite see the ""pro"" aspect of it apart from impressive specs on the inside with so-so execution on the outside.",0

"(Garbage:don’t waste your money): Absolute garbage. Not durable at all. Monitor flickered intermittently, then died shortly after warranty expired. Invest in something with more durability. I’ll never buy hp again",0
"(Please read before purchase: A very bad deal for you and your family): I bought this laptop 5/23/2019 for $397 to use as a backup for bill paying and streaming movies. I usually use a work issued laptop so this computer got very minimal use for about half of the time I owned it. The processor is quite poor and the computer boots slow. But it does have 8 gigs of ram and a big old fashioned hard drive. I was able to use it as intended for web browsing, streaming, and video chatting. Given the price at the time I thought it was ok.In March of 2020 I began to experience critical errors which required me to reinstall windows. This is the ""blue Screen of Death"" The first time it happened I was surprised, but this became routine and would occur every 3-4 weeks. This is very annoying because while you can keep your files, you have to wait for the install then add back all of your programs every time. Nothing about the way I was using the PC changed to cause this. After this happening several more times the computer simply died and could not be turned back on until I removed the battery entirely.So I see that because of the pandemic this laptop is now retailing for $649. Let me say that this is a complete rip off. If you are buying this for your kid to use at home for school, save the money and buy a cheap desktop and a webcam. This is an outrageous price for a computer like this. This PC is an overpriced LEMON. Can't image having paid $649 for this piece of trash to have it conk out in a year.",0

"(Was great until it wasn't): I purchased this for my son in July. It worked well until, all of a sudden, it died. I went thru multiple different steps that I found online to diagnose and fix it, but ultimately it never came back to life. The IT teacher at my son's school tried fixing it too, but to no avail. It wasn't dropped and nothing was spilled on it. It just stopped working. I will be ordering another Chromebook, but not this one.",0
(So far so good!): I’m enjoying my laptop purchase.,0
(Good laptop and amazing delivery): Got this as a gift during prime day sale. It came very promptly. I also live in an apartment complex and have a special kiosk system for packages. It's nice when I am out of town which I was when the package came. It came earlier than expected. I don't usually use the kiosk but they left it in there for me all securely. Laptop works great. The gift was a success as well! The only thing is that the camera could be better. My boyfriend needed a laptop due to his Lenovo shutting down and a nice camera (his old one stopped working) to confirm his identity for online tests. He tested it out and it was pretty blurry for a pricey laptop which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.,0

"(Issues with Touchpad and Display Driver): Laptop is extremely light...love it for that as I'm a writer and carry my laptop around daily.On the flip side, the touch pad works if your run your fingers closer to the bottom. The top part of the pad is non-responsive. The Intel graphic display driver breaks down every other week, freezing the laptop. I have to reinstall the driver frequently.Within 3 mths, battery life had decreased from 10 hrs to 6hrs, although the product boasts a 12hr battery life on its package.",0
"(Do Not Buy): After your first windows update be prepared for Armoury Crate to fail. This means you may no longer change any setting on you RGB keyboard. Did I mention this software governs your GPU/CPU profiles also? Don't bother reinstalling as you will find the ASUS security certificate for this application will not work with windows. Your only option is to return this item to Amazon who will tell you the first step is to contact the manufacturer. So they transfer you, ASUS will escalate the case. That is where I am at now. 4+hrs of my life gone troubleshooting a new laptop. I look at this laptop with disdain hoping its obnoxious fans breath their last breath. On another note Beautiful paperweight. 2 stars",0

"(Excellent All Around): I am very impressed with the Lenovo Y7000. I love the design, which is understated but still has some style thanks to some angled contours on the body, the matte finish, and the illuminated logo on the lid. It's not as geeky as most gaming laptops but looks handsome and can be used in professional settings without demanding attention. The build quality feels great, with some nice heft to the fairly thin unit. The screen/lid is very svelte and opens and closes smoothly without stressing or twisting thanks to a well-placed center hinge. Another design feature I like is the power cord attaching at the rear rather than on one side as is typical. I find that to be a better location that is more convenient, as side ports sometimes put you in an awkward position.The keys feel great. They're very responsive with just the right amount of resistance and travel. The numeric keypad is essential for me, as I use the laptop for bill paying, record keeping, etc. The keys are not back-lit if that matters to you. Not an issue for me. I love the feel of the touchpad too. It's responsive and not too stiff when you press & click. Like the keyboard, it feels just right.The screen looks good, with pleasing brightness, vibrant colors, no glare, and generous viewing angles. The speakers are not a strength, however. They only sound okay, providing clear sound but not much punch or volume. At full blast they are still not very loud. Thankfully they don't distort at all when turned on full bore.The performance is great. I am not a huge gamer, using the unit mainly for music recording, video editing, and general use, but my brother spent several days with it over Christmas playing Fortnite and it ran very smoothly with a consistently high frame rate using pretty high graphics settings. He's much more into PC gaming and was very impressed. I also love how fast the computer powers up: it only takes about 11 seconds to get to the login screen and less than 20 to get through login to the desktop. One thing that probably helps in this area is the lack of crapware preloaded on the unit. Thanks to Lenovo for keeping the bloatware to a minimum.The battery life is good for general use, but don't plan to do hardcore gaming without plugging in. As one would expect, performance takes a hit when you operate on battery power.Overall, I love this laptop. Aside from the less-than-stellar speakers, it nails it on just about every level: great looks and style, thoughtful design touches, powerful and fast, excellent keyboard and touchpad responsiveness, nice screen, etc. I am really happy with it.",0
(Why did not have 4 gb ram?): It's missing a 4 gb ram......well I'm just going to use my old part of my laptop,0
(Desktop level performance): Best gaming laptop for the money. This computer is an amazing value even with GPU prices dropping. This thing is more powerful as most desktops (14 cores!). Still very portable and useable for everyday things like work editing and gaming on the go. The only complaint I have is the battery life. Between the i9 CPU and the 125w 3070ti GPU this thing wont not last long when not plugged in. IMO it also look's a lot better once I had it in person compared to what I was expecting. If I could only have one computer in my life with out spending a ton of money I would hands down pick this laptop. I am very happy with my purchase so far.,0

"(Finally a decent laptop): I was wanted to get a good laptop for lightroom and photoshop, and my word, it was a nightmare trying to find one. I researched, purchased, and sent back three other expensive and highly problematic laptops from other companies before trying this Legion Laptop. Finally, a keeper, though it has a few issues.The main bummer is the battery only lasts between 2-3 hours. After installing the bigger battery, I now can get around 4 hours. I wish gaming computers, when not being used for major tasks, didn't drain the batteries so quickly. Also, the charging block is almost as heavy as the laptop, which discourages one from wanting to carry it around, and since replacement chargers are very expensive, from purchasing extra chargers.It is fast, able to chew through processes that would make my last laptop cry and the screen is pretty good.Compared to other laptops, the fans are amazing, even on labor-intensive tasks, they don't sound like jet plans taking on, and with regular use, I don't notice them. (I am someone hypersensitive to noise, so this is important)One thing that was worrisome early on was the Wifi, shortly after use it started to continuously disconnect. The solution to this was going to the intel website and reinstalling the driver.The only complaint about the key layout, is I am used to using the spacebar + left arrow key to go back, the lowering of the arrow keys makes this harder.I watched a review online that made it look like the screen was really flexible, fortunately, it is sturdy.I am not thrilled that they didn't include an SD card reader.The volume doesn't get very loudI wish they made it easier to take apart to upgrade. After taking out the screws, I can unsnap most of it, except that part that goes up to around the fans, getting it undone causes one to worry damage and breaking might occur, it is stressful, and unfortunately, marks in the plastic did occur, while trying to get the bottom off.Speaking of upgrading, for some reason the SSD I added was recognized and then not recognized, meaning I had to take her apart a second time, upon taking it out and putting her in, she worked fine the second time.",0

"(Just awesome for the money! Read for a few important details...): UPDATE: For anyone who doubted that the mobo in the 2022 version of this laptop supported Gen 4 SSD's, you can put those doubts to rest. I received, installed and tested the 1tb Gen 4 Micron 3400 series SSD that I ordered. The drive is rated to achieve 6600 read and 5000 write. Chrystal Disk tests mine out at 6545.55 read and 4934.03 write. The only way that I could realize the top speeds of my new Micron Gen 4 SSD is if the Mobo supported Gen 4 SSD's. So there you have it. Just be aware that a Gen 4 SSD in a Gen 4 mobo will run hotter than a Gen 3 SSD in a Gen 4 mobo. To make matters a bit worse, there isnt a lot of room inside this laptop for air flow. This may be why the manufacturer of the 2022 version used a Gen 3 SSD instead of a Gen 4 SSD. This is by no means an insurmountable problem. Just make sure that you shop for a decent M.2 SSD heat sink at the same time that you're shopping for that new ultra fast Gen 4 SSD. Ive used a 1mm thick graphene coated copper plate, on top of a 1mm thick silicone pad on top of a 0.07mm thick layer of graphene tape. This may be overkill but I dont want to waste even a single, brief worry on how hot my drive might be getting lol! I see the price of the laptop went up a bit. Its still a bargain!The GTX 980ti GPU in my old, self built desk top gaming system died last January and Ive been ""slumming it"" with a Radeon 7770 ever since because, after COVID hit, the price of seriously game worthy graphics cards shot up beyond what I was willing to pay. This laptop didnt cost much more than a really good graphics card so I finally decided to retire the ole' desktop and buy this laptop. So far(after two days, mind you lol), Im very happy that I did.First, let me straighten out one big issue. I AM REVIEWING THE 2022 Model! NOT THE 2021 Model! I asked a couple of questions about my 2022 system in the customer question area and mostly got replies from well-meaning folk who own the 2021 model. Unfortunately for those who bought the 2021 model a year ago or less for the same or greater money, the 2022 model is a significant upgrade and has some features which do not apply to the 2021 model. Many answers supplied by 2021 model owners cannot be applied to 2022 model owners. Its surely a fact that Ill be in the same boat as the 2021 model owners come 2023. Thats just how tech growth works.Anyway, the 2022 model uses ddr5 ram(2021 model uses DDR4) and has no problem mixing 1xr8 ram with 2xr8 ram. If you dont know the difference between the two, here is what little I know: They are essentially the same except that 1xr8 ram is one sided. 2xr8 ram is two sided. From what I understand, smaller sticks of ram will usually be 1xr8 while larger sticks(32gb and up) will usually be 2xr8. Some motherboards will not let you mix single sided ram with double sided ram. The mobo on the 2022 system will and from what Ive read in the reviews, so will the mobo on the 2021 system, so thats great. I added 32gb 2xr8 Samsung ram to my 2022 model for a system recognized total of 40gb. Ill be removing the remaining stock 8gb ram and replacing it with another 32gb stick in the beginning of Oct, when my new budget starts. That will bring my system to 64gb ram which I ""think"" is the max. IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2022 system comes with two slots for ram and has an 8gb stick in each slot. Both 8gb sticks of ram can be removed and replaced. NO RAM IS SOLDERED TO THE MOBO IN THE 2022 MODEL.Ok, next and also very important; The m.2 PCIe SSD interface on the 2022 motherboard is GEN 4(also awesome!). This was verified by the seller who has been excellent about very quickly responding to questions in the question-and-answer area for this product. The 2021 model mobo uses a GEN 3 PCIe interface. The difference between GEN 3 and GEN 4 in how fast info can be processed can be huge, depending upon the SSD you use. Put a Gen 3 SSD in a Gen 4 capable system and you'll be limited to the processing speeds of the Gen 3 SSD. Put a Gen 4 SSD in a Gen 3 system and the Gen 3 system will limit your Gen 4 SSD to Gen 3 speeds. But put a Gen 4 SSD in a GEN 4 capable system and you're gonna get the fastest speeds possible for that drive in that system.Unfortunately, the 512gb SSD included in the 2022 system is a Gen 3 Hynix. So, despite the system having a GEN 4 PCIe interface, the included SSD drive limits info transfer/access to GEN 3 speeds. The speeds of the installed Gen 3 SSD are nothing to sneeze at though. The read/write on mine were; read-3555.98 write-2707.89 and 2557.70 and 2581.43. Considering that a large number of Gen 3 SSD's proudly claim numbers significantly lower than those, the installed Hynix drive is pretty decent. But also consider that a high end GEN 4 drive like a Samsung 980 pro claim numbers TWICE those!There are two slots on the 2022 systems mobo for an m.2 SSD. One has the previously mentioned Hynix SSD already installed and that contains the laptops OS. Ive installed a gen 3 VisionTek SSD into the second m.2 slot on my laptops mobo. Its just a drive I had kicking around. I got a GEN 4, 1tb Micron 3400 series drive for a very good price and will be transferring my OS to that when it arrives in a few days. The Gen 4 micron SSD claims speeds of over 6000 read and over 5000 write as long as its in a mobo that is GEN 4 capable. Ill remove the preinstalled Hynix SSD and replace it with the much faster Micron SSD as my OS disk. Ill probably stash the Hynix SSD safely away somewhere, OS intact, as a backup in case the Micron drive ever dies for some reason. Finally, Ill probably leave the VisionTek drive in the 2nd M.2 slot and use it strictly for game storage.Im not sure what else that I can add that someone might find useful. Everything Ive written so far is stuff I had wished someone else would've listed somewhere in the reviews or question and answer area. I had to do a serious bit of research to figure it out on my own. Ive only had this system for a couple of days now but Ive been using it ever since it arrived(its so nice to have a fully functional system again, that is capable of running everything I like to run with ease!). I cant comment on battery life or heat issues since I keep my laptop plugged in 99% of the time and keep it on a laptop cooling pad whenever in use. There are options to limit the charge of the battery to 60%(or 80% if you so choose) which is supposed to drastically increase the overall life of the battery but again, such options are only applicable if you use the laptop plugged in most of the time-which I do. There are simply a whole lot of features for configuring the system to your needs and likings. To go through them all would be to make this review into more of a book that I already have so Im gonna stop here.This is a great system for the money. If I were you, Id grab it while you can.",0
"(Terrible screen quality. Don’t waste your money.): I own a MacBook Pro and wanted a cheaper option for a smaller laptop. After seeing the screen quality and lack of functionality since you’re basically locked inside Chrome, I sent it back immediately.I’ll just drop the extra money on a small MacBook.Terrible screen quality. Save yourself the trouble.",0
(Es rápida y buena capacidad de memoria): Para negocios,0
"(Excelente producto,muy buen y la entrega fue bien rápida,gracias): Muy bonito el equipo.Excelente",0
"(poor thermal design): good laptop when it comes to specs, design and software. Problem is that the fans run all the time and there are no controls to prevent this. Dell has removed the windows power plan control settings that influence CPU load and fan control in their own app, which can be configured to ""quite mode"" but fans are still running all the time.",0
The fans are always up in speed,0
"(It is important to know what garbage looks like): I don't own one of these, but my roommate does. I'm intimately familiar with it, because it's a POS.Let me start by saying I generally enjoy working on computers. This computer is not one I have enjoyed.But I will start with the good: The screen is very vibrant. It's a nice, bright IPS panel. There's a glossy coating, which is something some people like. Glossy panels are hard to see in bright sunlight, but y'all can give the concept of free will a bad name if you want want a shiny screen.The laptop is very easy to open and work in. A dozen screws come out, the bottom pops off and almost everything is right there to be worked upon.Inside this laptop are both an m-key M.2 slot for an nVME solid state drive AND a standard 2.5"" SATA drive bay, which is empty by default. 2.5"" SATA drive bays are uncommon these days, but someone who wants a secondary drive in their computer might be happy to have it. There is a single user-upgradable DIMM slot as well. Acer says this unit supports a maximum of a 16GB DIMM but given the generation of hardware in this PC, I'll bet there's a 32GB module somewhere that will work.There's a condensed numeric keypad for people who like typing off-center while they're using their laptops. See my comment re: glossy screens and the concept of free will, but this was the primary point of attraction for my roommate.This concludes the most positive comments I can make about this laptop.So what's wrong?In this era of USB-C power delivery and fast charging batteries, Acer provides a 45W transformer that charges this laptop in around 150 minutes. That's great, but this laptop only runs for somewhere between 75 and 90 minutes on a full charge for someone doing nothing more intensive than browsing memes on Reddit or typing on a Spreadsheet, and this on a brand new battery on a brand new machine. There's no fast charging. There's no USB-C. As with most Acer branded laptop-shaped things I've seen in the last 20 years, the original AC adapter is also poorly insulated and gets HOT. McDonald's coffee hot. Just under burned skin hot. Because the battery life is atrocious, this is a laptop that's not going to spend much time off its charger.Problem #2 and the biggest reason this thing can go straight into the E-waste pile: The DC input jack is soldered to the motherboard inside the machine, while DECENT laptops have their jacks on a modular port. My roommate keeps her laptop on the coffee table in my living room, and uses it on the couch. She's not moving around with it plugged in beyond occasionally switching between sitting and supine. She's not doing anything unusual to put tension on the cord or the jack. Nonetheless, her DC input broke off inside her laptop. Acer calls that physical damage and won't offer any warranty service on it. I bought a $10 replacement jack and soldered it down. It worked for about nine weeks before it too broke off inside. At this point, the laptop is just over six months old, and I'm certain that if I keep doing this, it's just going to keep breaking. I guess I could solder it down so my roommate can sell the damned thing, but at that point we'd just be inflicting the awfulness on an innocent party.It's also made of relatively thin plastic at all points. It's possible to flex and bow the entire laptop in one's hands. It has just slightly more rigidity than the box it came in.Just to put the cherry on top of this mess: Yes, this thing has an i7. It spends an awful lot of its time pushing against whatever the cooling limitations of the system are. It spends a lot of time with the fan running full blast and NOT running at full speed because the fan and heat sink on this unit are designed for much less powerful parts. I did ameliorate that somewhat using different thermal compound on the CPU during one of the many times I had it apart, but holy crap why would a person unfamiliar with computer hardware ever think to do that?",0
(Battery only lasts 2 hours): The computer itself isn’t so bad however from Day one the battery only lasts roughly 2 hours. We got it for my son for school. It’s only used for school stuff. No gaming or anything like that so the fact the battery only lasts 2 hours is very frustrating.,0
(Its pretty good): It keeps kicking me out of my apps.,0
"(Love it. It's great.): It's great. Ordered on 9/09 and arrived on 9/11. RTX 2070 is flawless. CPU is flawless. Cooling is sufficient but I haven't given it a hard push on everything with the highest settings. Screen is nice. Keyboard is pretty rad. Sound is better than expected. MSI registration was simple and setup up everything was a breeze. One thing to keep in mind is the power supply is big and heavy, but that's to be expected with a full RTX 2070 in here. So, this may affect portability a bit. Not an issue for me as this is now my main gaming rig and it handles everything.",0
(Stopped working after 5 months): The computer will not turn on after only 5 months owned. Almost from the beginning I was getting alerts that the drive was full. :(,0
"(DOA and Amazon's usually outstanding customer service fails): During setup, noticed an icon telling me it's missing updates. Went to settings; said updates pending. Clicking on the update icon did nothing, so clicked on Help, selected updates; it then said it can't tell if it's updated, and to call customer service. I tried restarting it; been ""restarting"" ever since. Called ASUS, and am told it's best to charge it for 8 hours before initial use (despite the menu I actually read saying merely to charge for 3 hrs prior to using it in battery mode for the first time). Was 80% charged when this crash occurred, so I don't see the connection.Amazon says they can't replace it, have to get a refund and repurchase, which is not great since it was on sale and can't be had for the price I paid 2 days ago.Should I mention Amazon packaged it with a 5lb protein powder canister careening around inside a larger box, with absolutely nothing protecting the computer inside its thin cardboard box, nor anything holding the canister in place so it doesn't bounce around into the computer?Total team failure.",0
(Its light powerful and has a good battery.): Have been using it for over half a year now and this laptop never fails to impress me. This laptop is everything I was needing and hoping for. Its light powerful and has a good battery. My job requires me to be on the move a lot and this laptop goes with me everywhere. It’s so light and compact that it easily fits in my bag and I have the 13inch Amazon basics foam cover which works perfectly. It’s super quick and responsive and powers up in literally seconds. Would definately purchase again and recommend to anyone looking for a fast affordable slip laptop!,0
"(Great little machine!): This is my second Dell 11 inch Chromebook. The first one I purchased refurbished and used it faithfully for over 2 years. I decided it was time for a new one (my old one still works) and I purchased a Windows-based 11 inch Dell computer - which I was not happy with, before I purchased this.I love this computer. It's fast, does everything I need it to do in a browser and the battery life is amazing. I get a full day of use out of it. I can leave the house in the morning, go to meetings, go to Starbucks and still have battery left at the end of the day. If you are a Gmail/G Suite/Google Drive user, everything is seamless in terms of integration.Keep in mind, you can't install software on this, however pretty much everything you need to do these days can be done in a browser, within reason. Highly recommend. I ordered it and with my Prime membership, I had it in 2 days.",0
"(Great introductory Gaming PC): Exterior box came in a bit damaged, however it was still wrapped in cheapo packing paper, as well as another box with Styrofoam strictly for the Laptop.Seems to be a very user friendly PC, definitely great for starting the switch from console to PC gaming. With the deals offered on this item, it was simply a never pass up opportunity. Great mixture of components, with a solid name going to bat for design and parts.",0
(Good on the go): Practical product for a suitable price,0
"(Beautiful design, but there are some issues): Let me begin by stating that we are a Dell family. I've had several XPS laptops and an Inspiron desktop over the years, and my children all have Alienware desktop computers. So, when I was asked to review the Dell G15 5520 15.6 Inch Gaming Laptop, I went in expecting to fall in love with it. Regrettably, I did not. I waited two months to write this review, hoping that the problems I was having were software-related and that installing all of the updates I could find would solve my problems. There have been two BIOS updates and a slew of other updates since I received this laptop. I installed every required and recommended update, and I kept other software installations to a minimum. I only installed a video conferencing app and a pdf reader from trusted brands. But this laptop keeps crashing. I have had at least 10 blue screens. Furthermore, I had to reinstall Windows because when I started the laptop, it would state that Windows did not load properly, and restarting the PC only helped for a short time.I've had a number of problems since the beginning. For example, even though the settings are set so that the laptop should sleep when I close the lid, it appears to keep running as the battery drains. I'll go to bed with a fully charged laptop, only to wake up with one that's at 0%. I tried leaving it plugged in, but it gets so hot that I'm afraid it's dangerous. Speaking of how hot it gets, even when doing simple tasks like editing a text document or slides, it appears to work so hard that it is burning up. It's better when it's not plugged in, but I can only get about 2.30 hours out of it on battery power alone, which isn't great. So I've been using this laptop exclusively with a constantly running cooler pad. I can see why this is required for serious gaming, but for light text editing? On top of everything else, my screen began to display multicolored lines last week as well. I thought that was it, but I haven't seen any this week, so fingers crossed.There are a few features on this laptop that I do enjoy. The design is wonderful. My husband is in the army, and the design is identical to his uniform, so I thought this laptop would make an excellent gift for him. I also like that there is a separate numeric keypad. That was missing from my XPS laptops. It took me a few days to get used to typing more to the left, but once I did, I was hooked. I also like how simple it is to turn the keyboard lights on and off. When I try to work at night, the light definitely helps. Another feature I appreciate is the Dell update app on the laptop. You don't really need to go to their website to get necessary updates anymore. Overall, if it weren't for the technological issues, I think this would be a fantastic laptop. However, based on my recent experiences as well as the weight of this laptop and the power brick, I still prefer my XPS, even if she is a little older.",0

"(This lap top runs off Chrome OS): not meant to be used as a gaming lap top. it runs off chrome os so that means it is not set up at all like windows. all apps and tabs are on the bottom screen panel, there is no additional number lock keypad in the bottom right corner like you're Originally used to so no high expectations for a singular use lap top. Meant for single tasks such as school with bare minimum task preformance. Though i am impressed with the preformance of such a compact notebook.",0
"(Good for the money but some glitches): I'm used to good work computers but wanted a cheap laptop for personal use. This has a great screen, is light, good key feel (soft clicks) and starts fast (although Windows 10, yuck). Problems are very poor and weak sound, and the function keys, including Volume, Screen Brightness, etc., all REQUIRE that you hold down the Fn key plus the individual function key. A pain in the neck and really hard to find in dim light. I had bought a Lenovo to replace my previous one, but sent that back immediately because it was so flimsy and took forever to start. This Asus VivoBook 5 bought in 2018 in much, much better than the Lenovo was. But OMG, those function keys!",0
(Awesome): Incredible machine. All it's built to be and more.,0
"(Gaming and portability, top!): This gaming laptop is perfect for new generation and demanding games. The price/quality is very good. It can run simulators like DCS and FS2020 without difficulties. I would only upgrade the M.2 SSD for more capacity (250GB isn't enough)",0
"(Our family recommends this if you prefer one that isn't touchscreen.): I have an Asus Flip Chromebook. My husband did not want a touchscreen, so we ordered this one for him. He loves it. It's a wonderful little machine. He likes that you can see it, the display is clear, and it's easy to use. (by the way, I love my Asus Flip - also available on Amazon).",0
"(Acer doesn't sell replacement keys?): One of the keys popped off during normal usage and when I tried to place it back I ended up bending the little tabs on the bottom not knowing how delicate they were. Contacted Acer and was told they do not sell any replacement keys which I find to be absolutely ridiculous considering how delicate they are, and that's more than enough to steer me away from this company for good.",0
The power prick is huge and it takes a lot out of the charm of the laptop built.,0
"(Other laptops can be better than this.): Ok, so let's start from the screen which is LCD that is worse than an LED-LIT, and the bad processor time to respond, processor count is 1 as it says in details , cheap SSD and 8GB RAM is not enough for heavy gaming, im so sad that I purchase this over the Helios300 with LED-LIT screen + gtx1060 + DDR4 16GB RAM + 256GB SSD and a 3.8 processor speed which is much better than a 2.8. All of that with a difference of 90$.Edit: I had no experience in laptop's when I purchased it, if I went back in time I would choose the predator helios 300 over the GL62M.Edit: at 10th of September 2019 I sold my laptop for a new acer predator helios 300 2019 model, farewell my first gaming laptop.",0
(Great for gamers): I love everything but the battery. About an hour use when gamming.,0
"(You can get a better quality laptop for much cheaper): Some people have noted in their reviews that the quality of the {…} feature is good “considering the price” … No. Even though this laptop is under $500, some features should not be as bad as they are.The screen on this laptop is decent, but it could be better, brighter, and less dull. I initially did not care much about the design of the laptop, but if you need something sleek and sexy, then this model is not the best.My biggest pain point with this laptop is the webcam. There is no reason that the webcam shouldn’t even be 2001 quality. The video has terrible playback, lag, and you will appear extremely fuzzy and grainy. For nearly $500 this webcam should be better. There’s no reason for the horrible level of quality considering ASUS is a company claiming to be making breathtaking products… hah.When I went to Walmart to look at comparably priced and even cheaper laptops, like the chrome book, their webcams were much more crisp and clear.If you need a laptop for web calls, this is not the laptop for you. I purchased this laptop for a family member who does not do much on the computer besides personal work…but the quality is still terrible. No one should have to settle for a computer that is only good if you “just want to browse the internet and watch YouTube videos…” It’s 2021 and the bar should be set higher.",0

"(Decent, but buy a spare power adapter): I purchased this for light home use, mostly by my second grader for virtual schooling. So far, it also gets used to play some games from the Windows store and Sims 4. Overall, we have been happy. ASUS generally puts out a good product.However, I docked a star for two reasons:1) customer support is terrible. My laptop stopped charging after 2 months. Root cause - bad power adapter. Instead of sending me a new adapter to try, they had me send my laptop in. It was 3 months before I got my laptop back. It was a long and frustrating story, and though everyone I spoke to was very nice, the lack of communication on their part was appalling.2) the adapter that comes with it is incredibly fragile. After the initial debacle with the power supply, the new one they sent me when they returned my laptop stopped working within 3 months. Replacing the adapter with an after-market has worked fine so far.For the price, this has been a good laptop. Just do yourself a favor and get a spare adapter for when the original breaks.",0

"(Best budget gaming laptop I have ever owned): I am very surprised by the quality of this laptop. It is the best sub 2000$ laptop I have ever owned by far. The sound is actually pretty decent. The NVME is a SAMSUNG_MZVL25123 which is a PCIE Gen 4 drive that I was getting about 4.5Gbps read speed (25 percent faster than my Samsung EVO 970). The motherboard (in my model) is a TGL QX60_TLS and the RAM is Kingston DDR 4 PC3200. The Video Card vendor name is Hynix and it does include 6 GBytes of ram with a 192 bit bus. The display is 144 Mhz as described and it gets bright. The IPS back-panel does show some bleed-through but you can only really tell when you shut the laptop down and start it up. It also has a second NVMe slot (on the other side of the laptop) and has the insulator pre-installed on the bottom of the top panel. The keyboard is a little better than ""adequate"" but not better enough to call it ""good"". Key travel is short and does not give a very satisfying feed-back.I could go on all day and provide benchmarks. This laptop has reviews all over the place online and it gets at least really good reviews everywhere I researched it.The point is that this is the best ""budget"" gaming laptop I have ever seen.",0

"(Great Value): Love this thing! I got it as a backup for streaming from my gaming system, and to play some older titles on-board. Some find the screen a little dim, I don't notice that. It's only got a GTX1650, so you're not looking at Anthem at Ultra settings with this, though it'll run everything out at the time of this writing. This is for casual gaming, after all. If your looking to squeeze out high FPS at 4k you're not going anywhere near this for sure. That isn't a knock--at this price point this laptop is a screaming deal.The i5 is great, and snappy in daily use. The placement of the various ports is a little goofy (hence deducting a star), but no tech is perfect. I run this with 16gb of RAM and I added a 1tb hard drive, which when added to the overall price still makes this a very good deal.And it isn't listed, but this does have Bluetooth.",0

Everything works as expected.CONS: This is not intended to be portable, so it has a very short battery life and speakers are are louder than a Lenovo Yoga but no where near the speakers on a Mac Book (my work computer).I'm not a PC gamer but this laptop fits my needs of doing print work in Photoshop running through Virtual Box (just can't get into Gimp).",0

I've been able to run a lot of high FPS games so far without issues and can't say enough about how good the games look.Besides your gaming needs, the laptop has the capabilities of doing anything else you normally want from a laptop.However, as with most gaming laptops, if you plan to push the specs to their limits, you probably want to keep the laptop plugged in or the charger close to you.",0
"(Great laptop): Runs games like Deep Rock Galactic, Metro Exodus and GTA V on max settings with ease. Only problem I had with this laptop though is the MaxAudio Driver that comes with the laptop and a few of the audio settings. I found a fix for this, but whenever I went into YouTube and started playing a video, the audio driver would turn on my web camera which isn't really necessary and a bit weird. I fixed this by ticking the option to not allow any external apps to use my webcam. I also had to find out how to disable ""enhanced audio"" that came default with it because it sounds horrible. It was pretty frustrating having to look all of this up as I hadn't had any of these problems in the past with new laptops. Other than that though this laptop is great.",0
"(I thought that I was getting the newer model): I thought that I was getting the newer model. It turned out to be the old model. The laptop is really heavy. The charger is extremely heavy as well, and it is close to the computer, so it has to be on the surface where you are using your laptop (therefore not rolled up next to where you plug it into the wall. Also, having to plug the charger in the middle on the side of the laptop is not practical. The battery doesn't last that long, so I have to keep it plugged in all of the time. The whole thing together is so heavy that I end up leaving it on the table all of the time as it is to impractice to just put it away on a shelf.On the bright side, it is beautiful and performs well in games. The graphics are great.I would recommend this laptop if you plan to have it in one place like a desktop. If you want portability, this is not the one to get.",0

"(Flimsy): Liked the size and weight for travel, but that's it. Things started falling apart after 6 months or so. Keys stopped working, or required heavy punching, for example. Some settings can't be changed or turned off once you change them the first time. The frequency of upgrades/fixes is really annoying (but that tech's mentality -- no reason to wait until things are stable to sell something!), and the screen size isn't something I would ever want for daily use. It makes a good toy.",0
"(Annoying but alright): I have used this laptop three full charge cycles now- from 100% till power off. So far, I'm liking this laptop. Maybe it's the newness of it. Either way beware of what you're getting into though. For the price range, it's decent. The screen is okay. The trackpad is okay. The price is okay for the specs.The keyboard, too, is okay. I hate that I have to press an extra key for Page Up/Down and Home/End functions. Also, the new (right click) key between Right-alt and Right-ctrl is useless is everyday use.However, the two things I found stupid and annoying are:1) The power button, and2) The low battery mechanism.Let me explain. The power button is at the top right corner of this okay keyboard. Top right is where we instinctively hit Backspace/Delete at. Couple times, I put this laptop on sleep mode while typing. Horrible placement.Also, when the laptop shows the ""battery low"" error, you have to run like hell for the charger. Thrice, I noticed, this device would show me an average of 1 hour 15 minutes at 10-11%. But the minute it goes from 10% to 9%, it automatically powers down. Yes! It completely turns itself off at 9%! How stupid is this. I'll try to change the settings, if it exists. Otherwise, I'll just have to get used to with using only 90% of the battery.",0

Conclusión si estás pensado en ahorrarte un par de dólares estándo fuera de USA.

"(A great machine at a good price.): Exactly what I needed, slick and hearty. There are other reviews that complain of fan noise: I can tell when the fan is on, but it's not super noticeable. I'm not sure if my unit is just soft spoken or if the people complaining of fan noise are super sensitive. Track pad works great, fingerprint reader is a nice feature. All in all, a really good unit.",0
"(Not suitable for online learning..): I bought this laptop for my daughter to use for online learning and after a year of use, it is a complete piece of garbage. At first, everything was fine. However, now there is a dark mark at the top of the screen that just appeared out of the blue. While using Google Meets, it is SO slow. After clicking on something it takes forever to respond. When turning on her camera, it works when it wants to work. All and all, I have to purchase another laptop for my daughter. I will never buy another Dell PC for my daughter again.",0

"(Asus Vivobook S): This is an exceptional laptop. Aesthetically, it’s very pleasing. Resembles a MacBook Air. I opted for the 256SSD instead of the TBHDD+SSD combo and I was pleasantly surprised at its quickness. I also like the fact that the monitor bezel is as small as possible to accommodate the bigger screen. Keyboard and track pad are very nice. The fingerprint reader is a nice touch for the added security. Again, resembles the fingerprint reader on the iphones. I think Asus did a great job with this laptop. Would recommend. **** If there is anything I would say that’s negative, it would be that there is some greywsre added once you connect to WiFi such as gift box and a few other pieces. But that’s typical when you buy a laptop I guess.",0

"(I am happy with my computer): I am a computing enthusiast for more than 20 years. I had many laptops before. I love this laptop. Its performance, design, keyboard, screen, and everything else is very good.Only complaints I may say (1) its brightness controls are not perfect, and it can forget about your settings when it sleeps and wakes up, but it may be because I am not using any vendor software, I am using a clean Windows install. (2) Its brightness level is very good but it can be even more brighter. Still, I am happy even under sunlight.Other than that, I think this computer is a great choice and offers a great value for its price.",0
(Nice): Fingerprint reader is pretty much hit or miss.,0

All that I have tried has ran great with no stutters and 100+ FPS.The speakers are okay but should get headphones.The build seems sturdy but the materials are a fingerprint magnet.Fans are loud when it's pushing games hard but it's expected. I haven't seen a gaming laptop any quieter.Overall I am very happy and recommend. My second and third is on the way for employees I always get new gaming laptops for work laptops. If they can handle games they can handle our work.",0

"(Updating review.): They should have just called this the Chromebook 3.I like it, it is definitely not overly powerful... It isn't strong enough to handle a CS job... However, I am enjoying the Chromebook for writing, accounting, and a few other nonheavy intensive things, the long battery life does make it easy to write on the go without worrying about plugging in. Which is the biggest plus with the CB. The screen quality still bothers me quite a bit, as in order for the best viewing experience you need to be directly level with it or slightly to the side. If you have the laptop lower then yourself, it whitewashes if you look down at it from slightly above. This right here is my biggest complaint.. as I rather have the view from the sides worse than one from the top. Because this makes typing on your lap a bit more difficult of a task without having the screen tilted back at a more awkward angle, that remains useless for non-touch screens.For the price it is worth it for sure. Just to be able to browse/research/write/account/email/etc on the go. Don't expect to much in the game department, you are restricted still to the bare minimum. As for how long it will last, all Chromebook style laptops are set to become unusable within 3-5years, as each brand stops supporting them. (this is from launch, not purchase date). I do find this tactic style of sale rather rude and tactless, like the good old Nintendo time switch that had the old Nintendo's fail by flashing blue screen after a year of owning them (don't lie Nintendo the only ones alive today are those that were refurbished,/rebuilt and every system that sold during that time flatlined.)The case itself doesn't feel cheap but is obviously made of plastic. The touchpad is responsive, and the sound is fair quality, not very loud. It does have some weight to it which is on the plus side. The charger is as small as needle you will need to be careful that it doesn't overheat while being plugged in to prevent damage, and snapping.",0
(Many issues): I sent it back. It had battery and app issues.,0
(Good): Good for play,0
(Pretty good laptop): The laptop is pretty good for playing games however the biggest downside to this one is that it gets very hot and you'll notice the heat during long gaming sessions and the fan is VERY loud so wear some headsets because you'll have a hard time hearing the game with the fan blowing and keep it plugged in as the battery life isn't long if left unplugged.,0
(HP Support sucks): Purchased this laptop in November 2021. It is still under warranty but the HP website lists repair sites of UbreakIfit it. None of these sites would repair connectivity issues under the warranty. Spent three hours online with HP support tech and still unable to access the internet. We've always been satisfied with HP devices - no longer! The Amazon support CS did NOT offer to help provide a three way call to HP to fix the issue just gave us the HP 800 number. Sorry we purchased this laptop thru Amazon.,0

"(DO NOT BUY A REFURB): Just buy the new one. I spent a total of 5 hours on the phone between Amazon's support like (they knew nothing), Microsoft (completely unhelpful) and HP (they knew a lot but couldn't fix the problem). Basically, the machine was convinced that the Windows software was illegitimate. It was a cascade of problems caused by how the software was downloaded onto the refurbished machine. I returned it and bought a new machine, and everything is working perfectly. Got it set up in 10 minutes. Do yourself a favor, and spend the few extra dollars.",0

To get to either the HD or ram you need to remove the entire back panel, 4 screws plus 7 hidden screws and the whole thing is clipped around the edges. Also filled with tons of bloat but I expected that buying from HP. If you ever want to upgrade or swap parts and don't want to mess with that then I recommend a different laptop, if you don't mind that part, it seems pretty solid though it only has the basics.Edit: Just realized the screen resolution is 768 and not 1080 but that wasn't listed anywhere on the product page.

"(A solid midrange performer): The laptop uses a powerful cpu in tandem with a upper midrange gpu to provide good performance overall, with decent battery life and the ability to charge it using USB Type C portable charging.

"(A beast of a gaming laptop at a budget price): This review is for the following laptop (since there are a few variants on this listing): ""Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-54-760S Gaming Laptop | Intel i7-11800H | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU | 15.6"" Full HD 144Hz 3ms IPS Display | 16GB DDR4 | 512GB SSD | Killer WiFi 6 | RGB Keyboard""I am a lifelong gamer, and a few years ago I picked up a Dell gaming laptop that was in about the same price range as this one. That laptop was a disappointment for me and just immediately made me wish I had something better, so I ended up getting a top of the line desktop to replace it. I say this because I've had a gaming laptop void in my life, and was a little bit skeptical of laptops in this price range, but was still interested to give this one a whirl.At first I was a little worried. The shipping box was partially crushed. Fortunately, Acer did a really spectacular job with the laptop packaging. Inside the shipping box is another relatively plain brown box, which looks like nothing special. Opening that, and you see a black box for the laptop, and, to my surprise, a neoprene style laptop sleeve for this laptop. Inside the black box is ANOTHER black box, very well packed, with the laptop inside of a fabric bag. I know the unboxing experience is not really all that critical, but I must say, I was very pleased and impressed with how this was all packed. If this were being gifted to someone, I'd probably open the brown box and wrap up the Predator branded black box that comes inside, and wrap the sleeve separately.The sleeve it comes with has a zipper on it, and an Acer predator logo on one corner. It's a basic sleeve, a nice touch that it's included, but I will admit I have a bit of a phobia of these kind of sleeves, worrying that the zipper will scratch the laptop on the way in or out of the sleeve. I have been using it though, and so far so good.After removing the laptop from the fabric bag it comes packed in, I was a little surprised at a few things. I typically expect a gaming laptop (especially ""budget"" ones) to be thick, bulky, oversized, heavy... and this one is none of those things. It's by no means compact or light, but it's just overall slimmer, thinner, and lighter than I anticipated. I was also really surprised at the finish. The back side of the screen, and the inside of the laptop by the keyboard is all metal and just looks and feels very nice. The budget Dell gaming laptop I have is thicker, heavier, and all plastic, so this was just a pleasant surprise.Powering the laptop on, there's a loud airplane taking off sound (not the fans) that plays during bootup. I haven't figured out how to turn that off. Windows 10 setup was simple, the only thing notable was during the setup I was prompted to create an Acer ID and register the device, and there was no way to bypass or skip it. The text on the screen actually referenced being able to skip it, but I couldn't see any way to actually do that, so I had to provide a name and email to give to Acer to get in to Windows for the first time, which I wasn't crazy about.After setup, I had about 429gb of free space on my first boot into Windows. Another thing that surprised me was that there wasn't an overwhelming amount of extra stuff installed. The extra stuff that I noticed was:- Dropbox Promotion- Firefox with Amazon Assistant Plugin (also noticed Firefox had a ""Allow firefox to install and run studies"" option turned on)- Facebook Messenger- ExpressVPN- Norton Security Ultra- PhotoDirector- PowerDirector- Alexa- ""Planet9 Link""Some may find those items beneficial, I tend to prefer a clean slate and put on the things that I choose. There's also a couple of items like ""PredatorSense"" which launches from a dedicated button on the keyboard - it's Acer's software to control RGB lighting, fans, monitor temperatures, etc, and I find it useful.I've been very pleased with this as far as performance goes. It's very snappy. Gaming performance has been fantastic. The RTX 3060 graphics is great. I've been playing several modern games at ultra settings, and they seem to play quite well. I'm honestly pretty surprised... and liking this a lot more than I thought I would. I've got a top of the line desktop in the other room, but I just find it super comfortable to lay on the couch and play on a laptop with a gamepad. While playing graphics intensive games the fans haven't gotten too loud, unless I press the ""turbo"" button on the laptop to ramp them up all the way.I also quite like the low profile keys on the keyboard, and the backlight/rgb lights for them. You can adjust the brightness, and set 4 lighting zones in the included PredatorSense app.If I have anything critical to say, I guess the speakers don't get that loud. It's fine if that's the only noise in the room, but if you've got a loud A/C or fans or refrigerator or other ambient noise, it may not get loud enough with the built in speakers. Aside from that, I really haven't got anything bad to say at all.So in summary, the following things impressed me:- The above average unboxing experience- Comes with a halfway decent neoprene zippered sleeve- All metal casing- Size/weight - not as bulky as expected, fairly slim and light given what it is- Not an overwhelming amount of extra stuff installed- Fantastic gaming performance, graphics at ultra settings- Fans aren't that loud unless you turn on Turbo mode- Fantastic keyboard with backlit keys, customizable lighting via the PredatorSense appI feel like this bats above its price range and impressed me in several ways, so I am very happy to give a 5 star rating, and will be a repeat customer from Acer in the future based on my experience with this comparing to a Dell gaming laptop that I have had in the past.",0
"(do not waste your money): I bought my Dell XPS113 in Costco for about $1,000 after their discount.There were problems with it from the very beginning - noisy fan, cursor jumped around when typing, signs of overheating, etc. An accidental water spill in a keyboard killed this machine instantly : it has no minimal protection against this kind of damage. Costco too had no warranty attached to a regular purchase and repair cost was the same as the price of a new machine. Needless to say, I would not recommend this computer.",0

"(Broken laptop at one year): I loved my ASUS laptop for the one year that it lasted before the screen hinges broke apart. I purchased this laptop June 2018 and have used it very lightly in that time. I mostly use it to check work email from home (which thankfully is infrequent). The laptop is lightweight, great screen, and is super quick, however, the build quality is obviously lacking. I opened my laptop up yesterday morning and both hinges suddenly cracked and snapped and separated almost completely from the laptop body. So now basically the laptop is useless as the screen no longer has any support and is just flopped down closed. I've reached out to ASUS customer support but so far have not heard back. There is only a 12 month warranty on the laptop so whatever repair costs associated with this fix will most likely be on my dime. Disappointing considering besides this issue the laptop was great.Update: Spoke with ASUS support, they won't do anything beside the standard repair which incurs a 60$ diagnostic fee and then whatever extra cost for the actual repair. Disappointed as I'm just past the year mark and they still won't do the repair at no charge. I own many ASUS products but this will likely be my last.",0
(Lo mejor por tu dinero): Es de lo mejor biene mejor ensamblada que digamos una hp que por más costo no llega ni de cerca a las mismas características la pantalla se mira muy bien no tiene puerto ethernet pero el wi-fi por lo menos a mi no me va lento es de 5GHz recuerden conectarlo a esta banda y no a la 2.4 si no quieren un mal Internet a mi me da 100 de 100 megas la pantalla es algo delgada no es exagerado pero es supongo algo con que tener cuidado me corre el lol entre los 60 y 120 fps y juegos como wz también pero aveces se traba supongo que basta con agregarle esos otros 8 de ram que dice que le caben no hace mucho ruido la ventilación creo es excelente no se llega a calentar si no hasta después de una 8 horas de uso y eso muy poco comprala yo pensé que me iba a decepcionar de algo pero la verdad es que no me sorprende que allá algo tan barato y con tan buena calidad no es premium pero si excelente,0
"(Defective Device): This laptop worked like a charm for the first 4 months of it's life. After then however, I started to see many defects. The graphics card would intermittently make the screen flash a white screen whenever a game loaded up. Also, the keyboard and touch-pad are almost completely useless. A few buttons on the keyboard are either extremely unresponsive or don't pick up on any input whatsoever. As well as the touch-pad which suddenly stopped working all together. I have tried removing/reinstalling the drivers for these hardware pieces but still the same result. Seems to me that MSI is not the best company for quality as of late. I recently purchased 2 of ""MSI VR Ready Vortex G65VR-096 Compact Powerhouse Gaming Desktop Geforce GTX 1070 i7-6700K 32GB 256GB SSD + 1TB Windows 10"" and the graphics card on that system was defective and had to return them. I purchased some Alienware towers instead, might do replace this door stopper.",0
"(Solid Gaming Laptop): I purchased this laptop to be used with iRacing (which is more simulation than game) and it has not disappointed! The graphics are excellent and the cooling fan noise (which others had complained about) has not been an issue. The system has nice cooling metrics and significant control over such things, but even at AUTO setting, I have been very pleased. I have not spent much time with it off AC power, so I cannot speak for the battery life, but it is not rated at a long time at all for modern laptops. Overall, I am very pleased!",0

"(BIOS settings are LOCKED! Can't change boot order, upgrade storage, or disable UEFI for Linux): I bought this to replace a 7 year old Linux gaming computer (dual-boot, multi-drive) with a corroded power supply, expecting to install a couple extra hard drives, while still playing a few games on the original Windows drive it shipped with. After a little research, it looked like I wouldn't have a lot of trouble installing drivers for the hardware that comes with this model, and the price was reasonably low compared with System76, so I went ahead and ordered it.BIOS and hardware upgrades: Once the 2nd drive I ordered arrived (separate packages, couple days later), I proceeded to install the 1 TB drive along with the 500 GB drive from my old system, using the upgrade kit which came with this computer. Taking apart the computer was fairly straightforward, but because Linux requires you to disable Secure Boot, I proceeded into the BIOS to enable booting from USB and turn off Secure Boot and UEFI. The BIOS password was NOT set, and I was allowed to add one of my own, but all the settings related to security and boot order were still greyed out. Despite installing 2 additional drives, and being allowed to set a password for one of them, I was not allowed to boot from anything except the 500 GB drive this computer shipped with or any kind of external media.I called the support number in the pamphlet that came with the computer, and asked about this, but was told that Acer locks the BIOS on all computers shipped through Amazon in order to ""protect"" customers from changing things that might break the computer if they don't know what they're doing. He explained that all computer vendors do this to one extent to another, such as Apple with iPhones, and refused to provide me any means to unlock it no matter how technical I am. He continued that if I want to upgrade anything, I should call Acer's main customer service line and order it from them, instead of trying to modify it myself. At this point, I demanded a refund because the item was materially different from what was advertised, and effectively unusable for my purposes as a result, but he refused because the package was already opened. I pointed out the product description did not list the BIOS being locked, and based on forum postings about this model on Acer's website, locking the BIOS did not appear to be a standard configuration for this model, but he stated that's what Acer wanted for Amazon-shipped computers, and that they're under no obligation to disclose this information prior to purchase, so I replied I will simply complain to Amazon and seek a refund through them. I did try contacting Acer's customer support number listed on Amazon, and on their own website; after a few days of trying, I did eventually reach someone (average wait time of 60 minutes), who ultimately confirmed Acer intends to limit customers' ability to change boot sequence for their ""protection"".Keyboard: This was a real nuisance. The 1 key, Q key, Z key, and I think a couple others make a distinct ""clicking"" noise when I press them, sometimes don't press in properly, and feel like they will pop out or otherwise break within about a month or so of use. It also has some weird light-up pattern that runs from left to right and flickers a bit as soon as it lights up. Almost looks like something is wrong, and might burn out in a few months.Battery life: While waiting for the 2nd hard drive to arrive, I played Elder Scrolls Online over Wifi a little bit. Computer was fast enough to handle it, but the battery died within about an hour, despite being brand new. Given how batteries decline over time, I worry about how it will perform after a few years.Screen quality: Says it's 1920x1080, but looks a little pixelated, which is kind of weird. I don't know how to describe it, but the pixels look a little larger than I'd expect, and the computer defaulted to a lower resolution out of the box for some reason. Nothing too special or standout-ish, I've seen better, but also not terrible.",0
"(Volume): I really like this laptop. It’s great value for the price. My only complaint is that the volume sucks. At 100% volume, I really have some difficulty hearing videos and zoom meetings.",0
"(Buen equipo): Recibido en excelentes condiciones, buena inversion en paquetes 4x4",0
"The graphics card is removable, providing an easy upgrade path to more powerful graphics capabilities in the future.",1
"(Great gaming laptop for the price): I needed a new laptop that I could use for gaming and for medical school. It's pretty heavy, but not as much as I expected for how sturdy it is. The screen has a little bit of a glare, but is fast for my games and the color is correct enough for my diagrams for school. For the specs, you aren't going to find much better of a laptop for this price. Very happy with my purchase so far! It does get a little hot, but again, with the chassis as small as it is, I expected it. I usually prop it up on a coaster or something to let the fans on the bottom work. The sound from the speakers isn't that great, but I mostly use it with headphones anyways. I have also heard the battery life isn't that great for gaming, but I haven't had any issues yet. It lasts for hours while I'm studying, and I usually have it plugged in for heavy gaming. Like I said, for the price, not much else can compare.",0
(Super good): Good produit I like it,0
"(Do not bother if your a business): Cones with Windows S mode which you are supposed to be able to switch to full mode, but it turns out only if you have a windows live account. Dose not work with a windows business account",0

"(Fast little beast): I am really enjoying it!Perfect for browsing, watching videos, and taking online courses.Fast performance and long battery.Perfect for my intended usages.",0
(Good for use): Good for office use.,0
"(Perfect for the price): I bouht it 2 monts ago, exelent performance! But there is a few minuses, forst very silent audio(i recomend download FxSound to fix it), display have some deffects you can see them in the dark room, steel components is perfect but plastic components very poor, other parts is perfect",0

(Boss of a Laptop): This is working as planned. No issues.,0
"(HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!): it’s a pretty good pc for gaming, i highly recommend it.",0
(lo maximo): muy buena,0
"(Best priced budget gaming laptop on the market): Laptop was packaged very nice, little bloatware, few updates to do right off the bat. Some Amazonians received a ""Chinese only"" Windows version, I did not.Out of the package the laptop looks great. Not super flashy, overall its aesthetically pleasing. When you open the lid you are met with a well designed Steelseries Keyboard. The laptop has a large palm rest area, almost too big imo, they could have spaced out the keyboard a bit better. I dont use laptop touchpads, but this one is one I would consider keeping my mouse unplugged for while web surfing and youtubing.Performance for the price is tough to beat. Beefy i7, little skimpy on the RAM only 8GB DDR4, easily upgradeable. Has the nVidia GTX 1050Ti 4GB GDDR5, the screen looks great no bleeding or anything, most laptops in this price range have just the 1050 or even lower specd GPUs. Also has 2 drives, a 128GB m.2 SSD which houses the Windows 10 OS, very speedy, I would buy a larger 2.5"" SSD to replace the slow 1TB.I havent pushed this laptop yet, and I dont really plan on it, I have seen other users on youtube get the CPU up to 91C, so it may get too hot for your lap.Battery life is going to be atrocious, and I fully accept that, I plan to stay plugged.I am very pleased with my purchase of this laptop, for the price and specs, I dont think you can pass on it.",0
"(Mine was defective.): This laptop is pretty and it has excellent specs. Unfortunately, mine was defective! I got a model whose mute, volume up and volume down buttons on the keyboard didn't work. And though this has an NVIDIA 1050 for gaming, my laptop kept getting too hot and turning off during gameplay. I had to return mine but I guess it's a great machine - if you get one that works!",0
(Like new): Great! Like new,0
"The display does not close completely even, slightly bent probably due to lack of good engineering.",0
"(The screen was failed): At first i thought this was a great deal.But upon arrival i noticed that is a very flimsy plastic made laptop.Battery life is not super good apparently.But the most important issue for me is that we ordered a used laptop (very good condition, supposedly only minor cosmetic defects) and received a computer with a broken screen...First time i try to order repackaged from amazon, will not try it again soon.",0
(Didn't work right out of the box.): This photo is right out of the box. It failed the start up sequence. I tried the system recovery and here I am. I bought this for work. Now I am out of a laptop for another 3 days waiting for another computer. Garbage.,0
"(Love it!): I am very happy! it is lightweight, super fast and powerful.",0

"(Good computer, good buy): The computer is adequate, fast installation and comes with windows 11, the shipment was very fast",0
"(Exceed my expectations): I bought this laptop for university school and let me tell you...it could take jamming! Battery life is long lasting i must add and the graphics quality is exceptional. I have absolutely no issues with this laptop. In fact, i will be buying one for my son for his birthday! Definitely recommend.",0
(So much cheaper then buying it from apple): So I got approved for affirm if I have I wouldn’t of been able to get this but I do love it. I use it every day for school just to watch videos it’s amazing.,0
"(Poor quality): Had to return first one after a day. Second lasted a year, but is now dead.",0
the power cable that comes with it is short.,0
(It’s a SCAM): This is not the product I ordered. The specs clearly state there is a 1TB HD and 8GB of Ram. This is just a beefed up HP stream. NOT WORTH THE EXTRA $$$. DO NOT BUY. SPECS are wrong.,0
"(Lo que necesitaba): Rapida, y no se friza, Me encanta!",0
(Love it): I love my Mac book. Great battery life. Came in brand new.,0
"(Best purchase ever.): Best purchase ever. I love the larger screen compared to my last chromebook that had a 11.6"" screen. It's lightweight and sturdy.",0
(Good for the price): Good basic laptop for my middle school aged daughter. Everything works and she is happy with it.,0
"(yo la recomiendo, Peru- Puno): aun que ahora tiene un precio mayor. yo la compre cuando estaba en 950 dolares, mas los impuestos y envió, me salio mucho mas económico, de lo que pedían las tiendas en mi país (al rededor de 1500 a 2000 soles de mas).hasta ahora no e tenido problemas, la temperatura de la tarjeta grafica no pasa los 66 grados C, la batería me llego a durar hasta 5 horas en ofimática con su plan mas ahorrador, al principio algunas veces se demoraba un poco mas de lo normal en encender(lo normal 10 a 15 segundos) pero luego se soluciono .supongo que con la actualización.el pedido me llego en 10 días. lo único malo del envió es el transportista(UPS-union pack Peru), cumplieron con los plazos de entrega y si me respondieron las llamadas. pero no me entregaron la factura (invoive) y lo mas importante la DUA (declaración única de aduanas) , según Amazon el transportista es el encargado de todo el tramite de ingreso, por último la caja de envío estaba aplastada de un lado como si hubieran intentado sacar algún objeto peque?o, pero felizmente solo venia la laptop Lenovo, en fin por no tener esos documentos no puedo declarar ante la SUNAT la compra de este equipo,estoy contento con el equipo, pero no me gusto esta parte del transportista designado en mi país. tengo entendido que DHL si hace la entrega de esos documentos de entrada, yo creí que enviarían mi pedido por DHL ya luego decía que seria por UPS, y estas obligado a que sea con UPS, por que no hay opción para elegir como en otras paginas.",0
"(Great gaming laptop for the price): Very, very good gaming laptop. Love it!",0
"(This Model Has No SD Card Slot): I bought this specifically for gaming, but does not come with an SD Card slot. Not a big deal, but for something this high end, you would expect all the bells and whistles.",0
"(Fantastic Gaming Laptop): The laptop came well packaged and took 10 minutes to set up and update. It's a massive upgrade over my 8 year old HP gaming laptop. Having a solid state drive, 32 GB of RAM, i7 processor, and the RTX 2060 video card makes this laptop an absolute beast. Sager does a great job of only including the necessary software you need to run Windows and doesn't include bloatware and garbage that just slows down a computer. Being able to adjust the computer performance, fan speed, and keyboard backlight color are nice additions. My only negative comment is that when gaming the fans can get fairly loud. Its not to the point that my wife has to kick me out of the living room so she can watch TV, but you do need to wear headphones if you want to be able to hear your game without the volume on 100. That's the thing with gaming laptops: with all that power they produce a lot of heat and you can either get it out of the machine with powerful fans or feel like you've got a toaster oven in your lap. It's definitely worth investing in a cooling pad to help keep airflow to the bottom of the laptop.",0
its the best value for money after a lot of research I did,0
"(Easy to set up and charge for use): It is a nice size, lightweight chromebook that is easy to charge and use.",0
"(Incredible for the Price): I've owned this laptop for about a month now and I must say that I am really enjoying it so far. After a lot of deliberation and a lot of reading conflicting reviews, I decided to give this laptop a shot because my other computer is an ASUS ROG laptop that is still going strong seven years after its purchase.As a student, I need a laptop that is very portable and capable of doing a variety of work. I primarily use this computer for coding in Visual Studio and other platforms such as Unity. I am a game design and development major, so I spend a lot of time coding games and working on web development.The first thing about this laptop that I noticed out of the box is how lightweight it is. I can easily pick up up with a single hand and carry it in my backpack without even noticing it's in there. In addition, the size feels just right for me. The screen is easy to see and the keyboard feels nice to use. It fits my hands pretty well and none of the keys feel our of reach nor do they feel cramped together. I also like how the touch pad works, which is a must for somebody who doesn't want to carry around a mouse.Some people have complained about battery life, and I have noticed that I can work for several hours without needing to be plugged in. If you are playing games or watching a lot of videos on this machine, you will probably burn the battery quickly, but I've gone days without charging it- but I usually only use it in short spurts.People have also complained about low memory, but once again I haven't had a single issue here. I think some people expect, as my mom would say, a machine that can fly you to the moon and back without paying for a rocket-ship. It's a silly saying I know, but it's definitely a common attitude.My only complains about this computer are very minor. Other people mentioned the screen is a bit wobbly when you unfold it, and I've noticed that if you or something else bumps into the desk or table the computer is on, the screen wobbles pretty violently. I'm not a computer expert and couldn't tell you if this is an actual issue or not. I've learned through experience working with electronics that buyers often expect a products weight and sturdiness to be an indication of its value, when in reality most products simply add weights to the inside of a product to make it seem better without actually adding anything useful to the design, so maybe screen wobble isn't a huge deal- I'm not an expert.So in conclusion, if you need something fast, reliable, and portable that you need for working on moderately-demanding projects, this is your laptop. Don't expect to go gaming on it or binging Netflix for hours on end without plugging it in, but it can handle a lot of tasks very easily.If anything changes over time, I'll be sure to come back and edit this review.",0
(One Laptop stopped working Advise soonest on next move!): I love this product I purchased three/with warranty,0
(Very disappointing): I ordered this for work and the outside of it has scratches and some buttons dont even work properly im quite disappointed quite,0
(I don't know yet so far so good): I love it so far,0
"(Excelente producto): Excelente producto, llegó con anterioridad al tiempo estipulado, cumple con todas las espectativas",0

"(Great Value): Very nice computer, ideal for personal use and business.",0
"(Wonderful, love everything about it, meets all my daily computer needs): Love everything about my new laptop. I do all my work based on Google Drive, so this computer is a dream. It is also easy to download programs that allow you to work and edit PDFs (also convert to excel and docx when you need) and you can save files to the computer as well. Quiet keyboard, relatively light to transport, sleek design. If you need a laptop for daily use for Internet, email, writing and editing in Google Drive (including sheets, PowerPoint, and word), and working with PDFs, this is the perfect computer.",0
(Avoid this seller!): Bought this laptop a little over a year ago and the computer has had numerous issues with randomly shutting off and going to a blue screen. Found out that the warranty for this product expired before I even purchased the product. Tried contacting the seller numerous times and they refuse to respond to any communication!,0
"(Overall I'm happy, but...): Would have given 5 stars but it keeps disconnecting and losing the wireless adapter. The first time it completely disappeared from the system and I had to reload it from the HP site. It was a pain to get it reloaded and connected! The second time, it disconnected from the wireless adapter but it was still on the system. I restarted and it reconnected. It's a significant inconvenience to not have wireless capabilities on a laptop!Other than the wireless adapter issue, the laptop is fast, the screen is bright and clear, and it performs as expected .",0
"(Seemingly Great Bargin): 09-30-19 Just received these today so take this review in stride as I usually try and update my reviews every couple months on expensive purchases like these. I bought two of these, they came at a great price, and right NOW I'm loving them. For me the screen size and picture quality are great. No issues as others seemed to have with resolution. My kids (11 and 12) are familiar with them because they use similar devices at school. They're seemingly fast, efficient and user friendly. They came ready to use right out of the box and limited effort on my part needed to be exerted to place monitoring controls on them.10-7-19 So, I haven't even had these products a week and one of the units wont turn on and will not hold a charge. I've contacted the customer support team (located in India i.e. thick accents) these individuals are extremely difficult to understand, talk fast, and I ""lost connection"" twice. Long story short I have to wait for a shipping label, go to a fed ex store, send it in for repairs and wait 7 to 10 business days for those repairs to be made. This unit is my daughter's so you can imagine how thrilled she'll be about all of this.10-30-19So, I went to the fed-ex store to ship these back. I had to purchase a special box for the chromebook, that cost $25, as shipping it in the box it came in and bubble wrap wouldn't protect it completely. It came back within the 7 to 10 business days as promised.....in a different box, upside down and wrapped in bubble wrap. Seriously?!?!?? Anyway it's working right now.",0
(Great for tweens): I lovd it.. its fast and easy to navigate,0
"(Powerfully Efficient and Lot of Memory): To start with this is efficiently built/designed laptop and no less compared to other laptops.First and foremost, the speed it boots up and restarts is pretty amazing. Came in nice packaging and on time delivery. The setup was pretty easy and comes with pre-loaded Windows 11. The screen quality is very good and soothing to eyes. Keypad is smooth and the keys seems to be pretty durable and last long.A laptop of 512GB SSD memory and 16 GB RAM to get at this price is very good. The 4-core Intel Celeron processor has a good processing speed.It come with following ports which is more than sufficient to connect different devices.HDMI Port, USB-A 3 ports, USB-C 1 port, Ethernet Jack, HeadPhone Jack, Memory Card slot.The 15.6 inch screen size is decent and serves the purpose. The battery life is good so far and no issues with it. It has good quality Webcam too. The weight of the laptop is pretty good and portable. Overall for the price and speed of laptop this is a pretty good buy.",0
"(Great laptop for the price): Awesome laptop for the price. Only thing that bothers me a bit is the screen. If you tilt it a bit, it looks as if the colors where inverted. And the caps lock key doesn't have a way to show if it's on or off.",0
"(Nice Laptop): #2 key stopped working after five months of use. Not happy, getting a refund, not a replacement, not happy about that either.",0
The quality of the graphics is outstanding.,0
(Incorrect information): The specifications state a 1 TB Hard disk drive. It automatically downloaded Windows 11 S but it stated that it was a Windows 10 OS.,0
(My chromebook was defective because four keys were inoperable when it was received.): Product advertised as new condition but the keyboard had four defective. I paid $44.00 to replace.,0
"this laptop is awesome, the weight and power and look is outstanding!",0
"(Read Carefully): Did not realize that I was buying a tablet, not easy to use Microsoft Products, have ti play games to use Office Suite, whatsapp does not work, TV sound and picture loose synchronization",0
(Five Stars): This is a great laptop. Happy with purchase!,0
"(Excellent product for a great price!): I use the chromebook for reading newspapers, financial records, shopping, e-mails, and browsing. It has met all my expectations-is fast and easy to use. I have no criticisms for this product. I am very pleased with the price and the delivery.",0
"(Started off on the wrong foot): Became unusable after first update which was required after setup. On startup, after the Acer logo disappears, a blue error screen pops up and restarts the computer. It just keeps repeating...Acer logo...blue screen...restart...Acer logo...blue screen...restart... It's caught in this death loop with no way to enter another command. Don't need a brand new computer that needs to be fixed after setup.",0
"(It runs entirely too hot): This PC is a beast. However, the Intel CPU is a joke in my opinion. The similar model with a Ryzen CPU does not generate nearly the same dangerous levels of heat. The option to undervolt this CPU is non-existent without third-party software and is the only viable fix. Cooling pads, and dropping game settings simultaneously will keep it at around 86 to 87 Celsius. If you go into the advanced options and disable Intel's turbo, the benchmark drops significantly but so does the temperature. It's up to you. You can sacrifice a great deal of performance from a mediocre chip for stable operating temperatures. I'm honestly a little unhappy... I would trade this model for something similar with a Ryzen CPU tomorrow",0
(Switch to Apple.): Do not buy this computer. Hours spent trying to update windows 10 and still not fixed. Between Acer and Microsoft this has been a huge waste of time. Customer support for both have been incompetent.,0
"(Sound volume is horrible): You can't hear anything with the built in Realtek speakers, volume at 100% is like 30% on my other computers. I had to buy a separate speaker just to hear anything. Would NOT buy again.",0
"(No more ChromeOS updates after June 2022): I've had my Samsung 11.6 inch Chromebook X501-C13 for a couple of years. I really like it. Convenient size, lightweight and good battery life. BUT, I got a notification saying no more ChromeOS updates will be available after June 2022. I would have given this Chromebook 4 stars, except it will NO LONGER BE SUPPORTED soon.",0
"(Delivers 100% on all expectations!): I researched gaming laptops for months before settling on the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin. I absolutely had to have a laptop with cutting edge graphics, SSD storage, more memory than I need just because and a CPU that could surpass any and all work load/gaming I could throw at it! I am an IT professional and have been in this field for going on 22 years now. I've been a gamer since about 1995 when I got out of the Marine Corps. My game of choice for the past 14 years has been World of Warcraft and I wanted for the first time to be able to increase all in game performance settings to the absolute maximum setting and still run smoothly and fluidly while still getting great frames per second. This laptop did NOT disappoint. I maxed everything out and I can see and hear things in game I always suspected but never was able to truly experience before without tremendous lag and choppy performance! Other reviews talk about the built in fans being loud but set on cooler boost they do get a bit louder but they are still very quiet in my opinion. This beast of a laptop also has not trouble with Overwatch on maximum settings across the board and it is a blast to play not to mention beautiful on this laptop. I was a little skeptical dropping the money at first but after a week with this laptop putting it through its paces I am very pleased to give it 5 stars with zero hesitation! My 15 year old wants one now and I may just buy him one for Christmas! Thank you MSI for delivering a magnificent gaming machine! I also use it for college course work and it is a true pleasure finally having a machine that I have to keep up with instead of the other way around.",0
It is super powerful and runs all games great,0
(Don't buy): This laptop sucks. Don't buy a Chromebook. Get something with Windows.,0
"(Wifi connectivity sucks!): Without Wifi connectivity it's not worth it. The Wifi keeps on disconnecting, and it's super frustrating. I don't even use it so heavily. I have it for a little over a year. It's not worth the money for such a short time plus it wasn't working properly after a few months!",0
"(Don’t Bother): I ordered this laptop and noticed it was running slower than it should, so I had a certified and licensed technician check it out. Turns out, the motherboard was bad, so I sent it back and asked for a replacement which couldn’t be done, they could only send me a refund and I could reorder. By the time everything was done, I had my refund, and I was ready to reorder, the price for the laptop had gone up by $30. I called customer service and asked if there was anything that could be done since it was a problem that came right out of the manufacturer, and because I really did want this laptop, they said no because it’s being sold by a third party and there is no way for me to speak to the manufacturer directly as I have checked. Upon further inspection, this isn’t even the same laptop that I had originally ordered. The specs have been slightly altered, there is no longer a SSD in this laptop, and it’s overall just lower quality than the laptop I wanted. So, in the end, I regret ever even considering spending money on this laptop and you shouldn’t either.",0
(Super! The grandkids love it): Super! The grandkids love it.,0
"(Muy buena compra): Es muy buena opción por el tipo de procesador, los materiales no son premium pero cumplen, la laptop en color azul resulta un poco más oscuro en la vida real, pero se sigue viendo muy bonita. Me gustó mucho el producto. Llevo 2 semanas utilizando la y todo funciona correctamente. Yo la compré en $7,900.°° pero he visto bajar su precio a menos de $ 7,600.°°. Recomiendo esperar un precio así para adquirirla y valdrá aún más la pena.",0
(Juts received it and I totally love the color): Juts received it and I totally love the color. Setting up as i type and happy I got this computer,0
"(What a piece of crap, wont charge.): What a piece of crap, wont charge. Acer needs a 10 days to send out new charger, might not fix the problem. NEVER BUYING AN ACER AGAIN. Also window s mode is a bunch of crap. Dont buy this. Amazon this is a problem.",0
(Not happy!): Speed of computer is very slow. We have an 11 inch chromebook that runs twice as fast. We have 400mg internet. So not the problem. We bought two and both my husband and son went back to there 11 inch. Very disappointed!!!!,0
"(A great work computer): works flawlessly. fast, silent, and quite sturdy",0
The font on the keys is a bit odd,0
"When you are customizing the light of each keys, some of the keys are emitting not enough bright lights as other keys",0
"(Works great, until it doesn't): UPDATE: After some more intense troubleshooting, I think I finally fixed the problem. If you are getting the ""WHEA_Uncorrectable_Error"", I would say that it is because your BIOS is out of date. I flashed (updated) my BIOS about 4 days ago and I haven't had the error since, even while charging. To flash your BIOS and fix the error, you will have to download the most recent BIOS from the ASUS support website, and then flash your BIOS. This requires a little technical know how, but basically:1. You will want to put the new BIOS file on a flash drive and keep the flash drive inserted into your laptop2. You will then need to restart your computer. While it is booting up, hold down the f2 key (this is how to get into your BIOS)3. you should then be able to go into your Advanced settings in the BIOS and find the EZ Flash Utility4. start the EZ Flash Utility and find the BIOS file on your flash drive. Install it and hopefully that fixes it!BIOS updates are weird, because you will always have to manually do them (no automatic updates!), but also BIOS updates are especially dangerous. If your computer crashes or loses power in the middle of them, it can brick your laptop. I would highly recommend doing some research on flashing your BIOS before attempting it. Good Luck!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I loved this thing, I bought it when it initially came out. It was perfect for school, work, and the occasional gaming (Overwatch ran pretty well on decent settings). However I'd say about 6-10 months later I would start getting a blue screen of death, more specifically a ""WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR"". This basically means there was a hardware error, not software. After this happened countless other times after trying countless things such as driver updates, windows updates, and other things I realized that the issue would usually only happen when I was on my laptop and it was charging. I hope that this information is helpful for anybody else experiencing the ""WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR"" issue, but for those looking to buy this laptop, I would recommend against it until they figure out what's going on with this model. I will admit, I haven't reached out to customer support regarding the warranty on this product, getting a replacement, or general fixes for my current model, (mainly because I believe that's a huge pain that I shouldn't even have to deal with given how much money I paid for this product) but everything I've read seems to imply that I'm effectively screwed when it comes to the warranty.TL,DR : Great product for the first like 10 months and after that it just starts doing a ""WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR"" which effectively makes the product a waste of 1300 dollars.",0
"(Good for general use but not for online classes): Love this laptop but I will say that if you are a student, a Chromebook may not be the best choice. Especially if you have online classes. Some of the software we have to use for my online classes is not compatible with Chromebook. Only windows or Mac. I ended up having to use my old crappy windows laptop to complete some assignments. So I'm disappointed with that considering I got this computer for school. But it is great for general use. Very fast and easy to use. I love that all my stuff is synced through Google.",0
(Good computer reasonable price): Generally like the computer. Keys are too smooth and lighted letters are hard to see in daylight. The fingerprint reader doesn't seem to be accurate. Guess I need to try a different finger. The screen is excellent. I miss the days when the computer came set up with software and virtually ready to use.,0
(It does what it's supposed to do): Don't like that you basically need internet connection to use.,0
"(I enjoy it very much): This replaces the mac air in weight. I enjoy it very much. As I seem to be more of a Windows user, then a Max user.",0
(Major Problems): I have had a lot of problems with this chromebook. Even more than my other chromebook. Not satisfied at all. Switching back to Microsoft or Apple. The savings are not worth the frustration.,0
(Lo máximo): Exelente,0

"(Compact/Portable Form Factor A Big Plus But Consider Swinging For The 15.6-Inch If You're Willing To Compromise On Portability): I bought the 4GB RAM Quad Core version but I had it only for almost a month before I returned it. The reason is I found a Chromebook with a larger screen -- a 15.6-Inch Acer Chromebook 15 CB5-571-C1DZ. In the time I had this HP Chromebook, I really put it through its paces by using it 6-8 hours a day, 5 days a week.I've had no Wifi or lag issues that a lot of people have complained about.The Wifi connectivity was rock solid with no intermittent breaks in connection and I was using this Chromebook for hours at a time. I didn't have any issues with lags either, even with multiple tabs/windows open. I used it a lot for video streaming and for remotely controlling my home computer -- no problems at all. The video streaming was very smooth.The battery life was also very impressive. I frequently ran it down from a full charge to 20% charge and I got at least six hours of use every time. I never had to run it down all the way because I didn't need to. It also recharged very quickly (about 2-1/2 to 3 hours from a 20% charge to a full charge).The Acer Chromebook was a better fit for me because it provided a better audio and visual experience. The Acer had louder speakers and, of course, a larger screen. You wouldn't think 1.6"" would make a huge difference, but it does. The larger screen means bigger text, which means Documents/News Articles/Email and other materials are much easier to read.Let me be clear: the 14"" screen is by no means a knock against this HP. The smaller screen allows it to have a smaller form factor. It is also very lightweight and well built. It feels very portable and it feels good in the hands. It sits nicely on your lap if say you need to type up a document or browse the Web while you're using public transportation.If you need a nice, compact Chromebook and don't want to have to lug around a behemoth, this HP is definitely worth consideration.",0
"(No Quality Control, So far one the worst laptops I ever got): all the reviews here are talking about the good part which is gaming and performance, but I will be focusing on the missing part . the build quality and the issues.I will start with the worst part. this laptop screen will die eventually no matter what . the design causes a terrible friction between the hinges and internal display cables . this is inevitable so if you didn't suffered of it it this doesn't mean your unit is safe . this makes the screen disconnects and showing scrambled colors every time you close it I move it to the level I became terrified of closing the lid on all my devicesalso I have never seen a touchpad that pad in any laptop I used over the last 10 years ( and I have used a lot) not because the touchpad before 10 years were worse . it's just because I can't remember how it felt . first of all you can't gain advantage of its size because of the numpad button integrated into it have only 2 modes , either enable or dead area . mean either you will keep pressing it by mistake or you will end have an unused part of your touchpad , it is too soft to be used unless you have sweaty hands. I had to add a screen protector to it to make it usablenot to mention that the software is quirky specially if you installed a fresh windows on it, and you are bound to the buggy windows 11 because of the 12th gen intel processors having an issue of windows 10 not being able to differentiate between performance and efficient coreAlso I don't recall using a laptop without function lock button. seriously in 2022 no function lock ?and lights . lights makes you feel like a football player being bothered by lasers from the other team crowds . even with lid closed if it is not totally turned of it will shoot lights from top into your eyes . makes it impossible to sleep with it in the same room or having to shutdown every time , and when you turn of the bottom light strip ( u know in a meeting if you use it for work too ) it looks like and ugly white stripe affecting the laptop lookthunderbolt 4 port can't charge, so if you are connecting this to an eGPU (yes I know for now you shouldn't need a eGPU with such powerful RTX 3070TI but future proofing you know) which means you will need to attach either power cable or another charger even though you could depend on the power from the eGPU , also on type C power there is no real way to limit the consumption so the battery doesn't go down while using itthe lid scratches sooo easily , I got few scratches already even though I am taking a good care of it . but the black color is just a thin layerno finger print or any other biometric login , but instead they added a useless keystone .the body of the laptop is creaking a lot, a part of it because of the swappable plate in the backI 110% regretting buying an ASUS laptop , they used to be good I didn't know about their quality reductionNote : I had it shipped to me out of US that's why it is not easy this to put it back under RMA or somethingthe Good and okay parts :> Keyboard : if you are using it for writing you will differently like it . for gaming ? not the best .> Batter Life : for a *Gaming* *Intel* laptop it is okay (about 4 hours of normal use) , but if you want a full day battery then stay away of this laptop> Expansion : can be increase to 2 PCIe GEN 4 SSDs and 64 GB of ram . costly but worthy> Performance : I use it to write code may be more than I do to game , and I would say it serves this purpose in a better way . it is very fast for development work> above average display : it get bright enough for indoor without bright lights , good colorsin summary , this could be a good laptop . I could let all of its disadvantages pass . if it didn't have a quality control issue that will render it dead soon and the touch pad",0
(Poor battery life & quiet speakers): Great except the battery life is barely better than my old chromebook and significantly shorter than my dell inspiron and lenovo legion. The speakers are also kind've weak. But otherwise a great laptop for the price.,0

"(Useful for internet, but no real home/office document use): The MS software included noted an ""S"". This means it will ONLY download and accept Windows/Microsoft products. I got rid of that (no going back) so I could use Google, Firefox, my security software and other things. Works fine. Paid $300 on Amazon's annual two-day sale.",0
"(Recomendada 100%): La uso principalmente para trabajar, pero siempre fui Gamer de corazón y quería una laptop en la que pudiera jugar MMOs sin problemas de tarjeta gráfica, y oh sorpresa esta lap perfectamente corre juegos como Final Fantasy XIV, Guild Wars 2, Sims 4, etc. etc.Tengo una computadora de escritorio que me costó $50,000 armada hace 5 años con una tarjeta GTX 770 Ti, uno de los mejores procesadores, enfriamiento líquido, buena memoria, SSD, etc. parece una papa en comparación al poder de esta laptop, me encanta.Aparte tiene un sistema de carga rápida y la puedes configurar dependiendo el uso que le vas a estar dando, por ejemplo si siempre la tienes conectada hay una función para que no sobrecargue la batería y se queda entre 55-60% y así se la pasa, deja de cargar, se descarga, la carga de nuevo, etc. esto prolonga la vida de la batería :)También es genial que tiene teclado numérico, para aquellos que usan excel.La pantalla tiene buen color (no es el super ultra mejor, pero es bueno)Inicia en menos de 5 segundos y se reinicia igual, de hecho rara vez la apago o reinicio a menos de que windows lo pida por una actualización.Cero quejas, 100% recomendada, la compré en oferta una SUPER compra.",0
"(this is a BEAST!!!): this MSI machine is a BEAST in a small package! So far we can play any game we have on high settings. We did do a few minor upgrades on it before we really started diving into it, put 32gb Ram in it and put a second 1tb ssd to handle most of the games. It can get noisy at time, but most laptops do kick the fans into overdrive when maxing out the hardware with some graphic intensive games. The battery of course isn't the greatest when playing games, but again, that is to be expected. The biggest disappointment I have for this machine is the location of the power input, it is in the middle on the right side, when nearly every other machine has them towards the back or even at the back, this one has to go and do that. Not a decision killer, but really a nuisance. I would tell others to buy this if looking for a awesome gaming laptop.",0
(Room for improvement here!): Will not remember my passwords and requires me to sign in to sites that I have already signed in to again and again. wifi is fast and thats good.,0
"(No good): I've had this for a few months now and I'm quite disappointed. I should have known better then to post a review before we really got down and dirty with the lap top. The lap top is extremely slow while surfing the internet or streaming videos or what not, whether working on the wifi or hardwired to the router. I have tried to adjust the wifi range and strength as well as increase the speed. I have reached out to many groups for support and haven't been able to make it faster, my 5 year old Toshiba is a better unit then this one. The shame of it is I purchased this because it got good reviews online, guess I have to reevaluate what I believe in the future. Moral of the story is you get what you pay for and I certainly did.",0

(Nice little laptop with poor camera): I love everything about this laptop except for the camera. I purchased the laptop for video conferencing while working from home and the camera picture is grainy and blurry because it's only a 480p. I wish I would have noticed that before I ordered it. If you don't need it for the camera then it's a nice laptop. Going to purchase a different laptop with a 1080p camera and use this one for something else.,0

(Nice Gaming Laptop): My friends told me MSI is big in the PC gaming space. I needed to get a gaming laptop that will work well for the family. I settled on this one because 512GB and 16GB of RAM. The video card is GTX 1650 and from what my friends tell me its good enough to play games on.,0

The 144hz screen is the best 15"" display I've ever seen on a laptop and it was able to handle all the games I threw at it with ease (Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Heroes of the Storm, World of Warcraft). It's also very light and comfortable to carry around.For the price, you're not going to get a better gaming laptop that's this portable.",0

(La peor calidad y el servicio técnico es deplorable): Al poco tiempo de uso la pantalla muestra distorsiones en la imagen. Envié a reparación y luego de 4 MESES de correos e insistencias telefónicas me han enviado el computador EN LAS MISMAS CONDICIONES.

(WARNING READ THIS): ok WARNING im only giving this a three star because well whats good is i love the keyboard and i love the screen and the cover is beautiful but why i only gave it a three star is because my chromebook came with a defect where i can only use it when its charging so say i at 100% if i unplug it it just dies right away ad the screen goes black but this shouldnt happen on all of them,0
"(Perfect basic laptop): This laptop is perfect for many if not most people's needs.

"(Died after a month, seller unresponsive): Absolutely loved the product for the month it worked... After that it would not show any signs of life, whenever I tried to start the device it would not turn on or even show charge. I would charge it for a few hours and the led would display charge but the laptop refused to start and once disconnected from the outlet would once again display zero signs of life.I have sent multiple messages to the seller through Amazon with zero response. Do not buy this product and if you do go directly so if it buggers up you can get a replacement!",0
"(Difficult to open bottom plate.): Great gaming laptop overall. Most games I play are War Thunder, Genshin Impact, Destiny 2, Elena Ring, and Ready or Not. I recommend capping the fps to 60 so it doesn't get too hot quick. The fans ramps up and produces a lot of noise when gaming (expected). I wouldn't recommend playing graphically heavy games though since it'll heat up real fast and likely to shorten it's lifespan.The screen is nice and gets bright. Hate the huge bezel at the bottom.MSI center is cool. The RGB on the keyboard you can change, but very limited.I was attempting to stick in my 500GB m.2 storage, but opening the bottom plate was difficult. It was around the headphone jack where it didn't want to pop out. I didn't want to risk breaking the plate nor the insides so I'll have to work with it's 500GB storage for now.",0
"(Hasta ahora todo bien!): Hasta ahora la computadora ha funcionado bien, esperábamos que pudiera ser ligeramente lenta pero no fue así!

Si la recomiendo (por el momento).Ojo solo tuvimos problemas en la entrega pues llegó antes de lo esperado y al repartidor se le hizo fácil dejarla con los vecinos (que ni conocemos) y temíamos lo peor pero esto realmente fue tema de paquetería más no del funcionamiento del equipo.",0

"(Excellent budget gaming laptop): Great gaming laptop at a competitive price. Very portable for my daily use. Games looks great and run smoothly with the ones I tested. Sound is good, louder than my office lenovo laptop. Keyboard feels great to type with and the LED back-light is a plus",0
(Do it~it's a fantastic laptop!): It's been everything I wanted and more in a laptop the only thing I've disliked is pre-installed McAfee antivirus it's been a pain to get rid of but not impossible all things considered it's a plus in my book. I've contacted customer service twice and they've been exceptional in assistance and response.,0
"(Second times the charm!): I have received my first unit however it does not power on. Asus support advised me to exchange it so I am currently in the process of doing so. The notebook had also clearly been used or at least opened previously as the box was packaged very sloppy and there were smears on the display. Will update once I get a unit that works.UPDATE:Since I originally wrote this review I have been in touch with amazon and it is believed that whoever returned the unit I got the first time did not flag it as defective so the defective unit was sent to me, Luckily amazon has some pretty great customer service and we were able to return my first unit and get the new one with in a week. I have been using the notebook for a few days now and have been enjoying pretty much everything I was looking for in a laptop. However it does lose one star as the fan is rather load even when doing some fairly basic tasks, but I was aware of this before I purchased and I think it is still well worth it, this is the cheapest ultrabook you can find thats below 1000 CAD. I would still highly recommend this if your looking for a thin, light, and well built notebook..",0
(No Bluetooth as advertised!!!): I am returning this laptop. It is advertised to have Bluetooth and doesn’t. I have to have Bluetooth. This is now going to be such a hassle to return and have to order another laptop......after checking to make sure that the seller’s description is accurate!,0
(5-star terrific): I've been with PCs since IBM first unveiled it in Chicago at the SHARE conference. This is the fastest one I've ever owned. I bought it to replace an old Toshiba used for music and audio books. This notebook is too great to use for just that. Can't say enough good things about it.,0
"(A very satisfying laptop): Product Review: Lenovo Legion 5 Gaming Laptop, 15.6"" FHD (1920x1080) IPS Screen, AMD Ryzen 7 4800H Processor, 16GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GTX 1660Ti, Windows 10, 82B1000AUS, Phantom BlackLenovo has never let me down. Maybe I'm lucky, or they are just that good. This is a solid, mid-level gaming laptop that doesn't break the bank or weigh you down.Summary: excellent construction, keyboard, screen, and thermal performance. Battery life is not unexpectedly just fair, and as of this writing, it does not seem that the 144hz IPS screen is capable of adaptive sync / G-Sync compatibility mode. This is unfortunate.Construction and design is typical of Lenovo, solid all around, with their overall conservative, business-oriented styling, even for this Legion 5, and I really appreciate the fact that this doesn't scream gaming laptop. Excellent built-in port selection, with four USB-A's, a USB-C, HDMI, ethernet, and headphone. Notable for the absence of a SD/microSD card reader or TB3 port.The keyboard has a layout that lends itself well to touch typing, with a crisp tactility that I makes typing very enjoyable. The touchpad is large and responsive, for those who will use it, less important for me since I always use a mouse.The screen is a nice IPS panel, 300 nit brightness with an impressively wide range of brightness settings. I am as interested in the low end of the scale as the high, as this will determine if the display is night time friendly. It is.The speakers are above average, not spectacular but usable. Does support Dolby Atmos which is a nice plus.Thankfully, there is minimal bloat preinstalled, just McAfee that was immediately uninstalled and Lenovo's own software that is actually a good idea to keep on board.Performance is impressive with the Ryzen paired with a GTS 1660Ti and 144hz screen. Thankfully the laptop has excellent cooling, did not experience any thermal throttling. Will play most AAA games at acceptable frame rates with modest adjustments to the graphics settings.Negatives:- No adaptive sync / G-sync compatibility. This is for me more than a little bit of a let down. I was really hoping for this feature.- No biometrics. i.e. no built-in fingerprint reader or Hello compatible webcam for automated secure sign in.- No TB3. Not a major drawback, but one nonetheless.- No SD/microSD card reader built-in.Conclusion: This is a well-sorted package, versatile and competent, that delivers a wonderful and satisfying user experience and is just great to use as an all-arounder laptop for your daily needs.",0

I tried buying an external drive but that doesn't do anything for updates. It constantly wants to update but lets you know there isn't any memory to do so. I have never stored anything on the computer itself after learning from my mistakes from the first one. I stored everything on an external drive. This allowed my to get another 6 months on it. I'm going to keep using it until it no longer allows me to do so.I used this as my only computer for 1.5 years and only used it for the bare minimum. Excel sheets, word documents and email.

Why do we have to use Guest just to browse other email accounts on our own laptop?? Not giving someone no option at all to sign out, of anything for that matter, is just stupid. I don’t like being forced to do things a certain way, especially if the laptop was bought to multitask! So yeah, a waste to me. Plus the storage won’t even let you delete files once the storage is used up. Smh just irritating. Google has got to do better man. It’s so many complaints about this issue.

The price for the hardware in this bad boy is what makes this a no brainer to purchase. The battery lasts about 2 hours for me when editing a video, and I would assume gaming would be even less, but let's be honest... if you are going on this thing you are going to have it plugged in.great laptop!",0

Yo soy estudiante de ingienería en software y pues todos los dias estamos en contacto con computadores y la mayoría de ellos Windows y distribuciones de Linux. Muchos de nosotros, como estudiantes de esta rama, tenemos una mala imagen de lo que es Apple como marca: que básicamente te venden la manzana mordida, pero al fin y al cabo todo esto son prejuicios. Al final me di cuenta que estaba equivocado. Una cosa segura es que te puedas comprar una PC con mejores especificaciones a este precio, pero la belleza y lo fino que son estas MacBook y el sistema operativo, hace que, aunque suene raro, las especificaciones queden un poco de lado.

"(Great Computer with Only Annoying Faults): There was a lot I was looking forward to with this computer. The titain graphics card told me this was the best bang for my buck and my husband has always loved his MSI gaming computer. So, I got it.First off, this computer runs beautifully. It's a bit bulkier than I expected after seeing my husband's MSI Stealth Pro. It was a bit frustrating for me since I have to travel with mine and I need portability. It's not the end of the world, but it is irritating. There is a lot of bloatware so expect a couple hour of updates and clearing that.The SSD is going to be mostly taken up by the operating system. Don't plan on being able to download multiple games to the SSD. I didn't have room for Overwatch and my windows updates.While that too is irritating, the thing that drives me bonkers is that the touch pad squeaks. YES SQUEAKS. I cannot left click without an irritating squeak every time I touch the darn thing.Overall, it can run what you need it to and it's very powerful with simply annoying flaws. Nothing ridiculous, but definitely annoying.",0

I contacted Lenovo to let them know the Chromebook battery is still not working properly and they informed me the warranty has run out, so I must contact a local service center and pay for repairs. I contested the warranty claim, since it still had the same problem as before, so therefore it was not fixed and it should still be ""under warranty"" with the original repair claim date.

(Excellent value!): Perfect for my 10 year old. I find the keyboard hard to use because of its smaller size and my hands are large. We have had it for 3 months and it's excellent for researching. They use Google drive at school so this is perfect. Excellent value for what we need at home.,0
(Very nice): I love everything about it,0
"(Exelente relación calidad-precio): Rápida, buenas prestaciones, muy buena evaluación en la relacion calidad-precio, yo la compre en poquito menos de 20,000 mxn por lo cual es la mejor oferta que he encontrado, llego antes de lo previsto.",0
"(Value for money): So this is an affordable laptop for those who need to work from home or online classes. Its a nice size screen and slim which is important to me. I only have two issues with this laptop, firstly the camera is not the best quality if you need to do zoom meetings and secondly its advertised as having a backlit keyboard but that's not so.",0
"(Great battery life and fast): Pleasantly surprised by the quality of these refurbished devices. I orded several for my 2nd grade class. They are fast, easy to use and seamless between applications. Awesome battery life. I plan on ordering for my personal use. Great quality and great price!",0
(The atention x the seller): Is a wonderful pc,0
"(I love this laptop!): I have use this laptop for couple days, there’s something I like and don’t like, first of all, it’s Really very good quality, feels much better than previous generation. I use it for gaming and video processing, it’s very high efficiency laptop for video processing and the noise is lower than MacBook Pro when rendering 4K video in premiere pro,Rendering speed is way more faster than MacBook Pro 2018 with 16g RAM.Cons: Keystone is not very well secured, easy to get lost. Cover material feels very good but it’s a Finger prints magnet, and not easy to clean up.Expectation: If I have a choice of 4K monitor, it will be great. But in Canada, I can’t find that option anywhere.",0
(Excelente servicio): Buen plazo de entrega fuera del país. Buen diseño,0
"(It’s a good price now. I bought it at 879, and I thought still that was a good price.): I like the fps I’m getting and the graphics. I do however dislike the battery life I get around 3-4 hours for battery life. And what I’ve also noticed is, keep your charger plugged in, when my charger wasn’t plugged in, I started to lag a bit and my fps dropped. Overall great product. I bought it at $879. I wish I waited a bit so the price would move dropped ):",0
powerful and very light compared to other full laptop RTX cards.,0
"(Missing parts had to pay extra smh): I received my product today however when I opened the box the laptop was there but it was missing the adopter and power cord when I called customer service for Amazon all they suggested was I return and then reorder, I explained that this was not possible because I need this laptop for business purposes, so unable to return and file for a refund I am forced to purchase the adapter and power cord separately I paid even more money plus shipping and handling despite already paying $350 already smh this is unacceptable how did ACER EMPLOYEES not notice they put the computer in the box without the adapter or power cord how do amazon and Acer expect me to charge and use the laptop if I do not have the two most main important components!If I get this thing up and running I will I didn't my review to see how well it works or not!",0
(Excelent delivery and product): Excelent delivery and product,0
The external lights are subtle,0
(I recommend this product): I am so glad I found this product that I can use. User friendly very convenient I love it,0
(Performance was good at first then went downhill.): It was a beast at first. Worked fine until I got a black screen that I could only get away with a hard reset. Had tried it on a couple intensive games and gotten 100+ frames on ultra settings. Now hardware is messed up and I can’t get any more then 20 fps on any game. Laptop laggy and have gone through 2 different IT people at Lenovo.,0
"(Used for two years!): Bought in 2020 still using in 2022, it works great, I recommend using an external monitor with a higher refresh rate and smoother fps. Love this laptop and hope this review can help you with a long-term review.",0
"(Plagued by power problems and repairs): While this laptop does have a nice design and decent screen with 144hz refresh rate, my experience with this laptop has been plagued with power issues that required my computer to go back to Acer for now a 2nd time for the same exact issue. On top of that, Acer customer support is not easy to access or particularly helpful until you get higher level managers involved. For a laptop that costs such a premium price, I would expect a much higher quality product and that simply has not been the case. Very disappointed in Acer this time around.",0
(Five Stars): This is an amazing computer. mac books are overrated. This computer is sexy and works amazingly,0
"(What a pleasant surprise!): As a long-time tech geek and early adopter, I've always had quite a few computers around the house. I switched over from Mac to Windows a couple of years back, and I've recently focussed on two machines: a Surface Pro X for work-related stuff, and an Acer Nitro 5 with discrete GPU for gaming. But I've been getting dissatisfied with both. The Surface Pro X is beautiful, but the 2-in-1 configuration can be awkward (hard to balance on your lap, for instance), and I rarely use it in tablet mode. Meanwhile I learned that the Acer Nitro won't be supported under Windows 11, because the CPU is too old; this is a bummer, because I'm realling enjoying Windows 11 on my Surface.So I decided to get the Acer Swift 3 to replace the Surface. It's thin and light (slightly larger/heavier than my partner's MacBook Air, but half the weight of the Nitro), and the reviews of the new Intel integrated graphics have been enthusiastic.What I didn't expect was that it would blow away both SPX and Nitro in every performance category. While it probably won't run Cyberpunk 2077, it's turning out to be a great gaming machine.I use Passmark for benchmarking, and the numbers are crystal clearOverall score: Surface Pro X: 602 Acer Nitro 5: 2,128 Acer Swift 3: 4,721CPU: Surface Pro X: 4,185 Acer Nitro 5: 6,470 Acer Swift 3: 12,9322D Graphics: Surface Pro X: 54 Acer Nitro 5: 244 Acer Swift 3: 6783D Graphics: Surface Pro X: 276 Acer Nitro 5: 1,909 Acer Swift 3: 3,393(Yes, the Surface Pro X benchmarks poorly, but I'm pretty sure the benchmarks aren't optimized for the ARM CPU.)I really like the Swift 3. The keyboard is good (though the backlighting is slightly overdone, particularly the function keys). The screen is crisp and bright, though I wouldn't use it for professional graphics work, because the gamut is a bit restricted. However it drives my high-end external displays very nicely.It doesn't have a touch screen, which is no great loss. It runs quiet and cool. And although it comes with a traditional power brick, it can be charged through the Thunderbolt USB-C port, which means that I have one plug docking. (My Thunderbolt hub connects to power, screen, mouse, and HD webcam.)And now I have to finish migrating everything from the other two machines to the Swift.....",0
"(High temperatures): The laptop is great! It runs very well and smooth every game I've tried on it... However it get really hot! Temperatures go above 90 degrees, but it can be fixed by undervolting the battery a little without loosing performance.",0
(that the computer is good): to live these product (computer)of $600.00 at the stares when is raining not if even to knock at the door is a shame,0
(Nice and light but keyboard needs improvement.): The keyboard is too shiny.,0
(Great price and worth every penny): I bought the computer for my son’s birthday and he loves everything about this computer.,0
(buyers beware): was working but after 1 week it died. apparently lenovo products are known to have defects.,0
(Good product): Good,0
"(Muy buena!): Está muy bien, sólo considera ue el teclado físico está en inglés.",0
(Love it!): This chromebook does everything I need it to without the high cost of Apple products and the sheer inconvenience of Windows.,0
(Great lap top): Nice light weight great picture quality! Get you a case!!!,0
"(Everything and more...): Sleek design, awesome keyboard setup, exceptional graphics quality and sound. This is a great gaming computer as well as everyday work as a graphics designer. I am very impressed with the overall qualities and features this computer gives me. I highly recommend and would buy again.",0
(LOVE IT): I LOVE EVERYTHING about it gotta get used to using a keyboard without looking at it . My FIRST BRAND NEW LAPTOP. But my second laptop.,0
"(Worth the Upgrade): This laptop is blazing fast. It was a great upgrade from my three year old HP Omen. The only drawback is it can get decently warm in heavy use. The fan button is loud. If you're wearing headphones, you won't hear it much. I was cross shopping between this and the ASUS M15 from Best Buy. I am glad I went with the MSI. The vents are covered by a metal mesh, so it allows for a good cooling with a laptop cooler. I am happy with this purchase.",0
(Manejo): En general el producto es muy bueno en la primera semana que lo utilizo.El unico inconveniente es que emite un sonido raro al subir el volumen.,0
(Five Stars): superb,0
(Battery life is not as good as they say): The battery only lasts 6 hours using it with low performance.,0
"(Buen equipo): Todo bien hasta que revisé y tenia 2 ram de 3000 de 4 gb cada una ,pero trabajando a 2660 mhz se suponía que era una sola ram de 8 y quedaba un slot para el upgrade...",0
(Hard to customize your apps and preferred browsers.): So far the battery life seems way too short. Maybe I have to tweek some settings or contact customer support.,0
"(Bang for your buck): Best bang for your buck. Unit boots up in SECONDS. Screen is really nice, very pleasant for gaming and editing media. Battery life is approximately 3 hours IF you’re just browsing the internet, using light apps, streaming video, etc. My only gripe is that I assumed the 8750H would be more powerful (it’s not bad by any means, just expected better) but i can run most games at high-ultra and get some serious frames as this is the full 1060 6gb and not the max Q version. No frame-drop issues so far but i usually use the fan controller program that’s preinstalled and keep it on max as this unit does get pretty warm (it’s a gaming laptop, duh?). Acer hit the mark with this one. if you have $1100 laying around and want to get a solid gaming laptop, I highly recommend it.",0
(Recommended): Amazing computer for the price.,0
"(Very cheaply made): Not good. The keys were loose and the plastic holding the keys in place was warped and very flimsy. The overall feel of the computer is very cheap for the price tag. I couldn't say much about the battery or specs because to be honest, I opened it up and noticed straight out the box it was such low quality. I Just sent it back for a refund.",0
"(Worth it!): Work perfectly, worth money no cracks or anything wrong came perfect packaged",0
"(Great usability especially for the price): Excellent device for 95% of computer needs (browsing, playing music, research). It is fast, doesn't hiccup and the Chrome browser renders all websites well.The ease of adding more user profiles has been really helpful.Also, the addition of Android apps (if you switch to the beta channel) is nice. Some look clunky since they are meant for the phone layout, but just having access is a great case for this being the primary home computing device.",0
(WASTE of MONEY): Broke after one day FROZE and it stayed that way!Waste of TIME n money,0
"(LOVE my Predator. It’s a BEAST): TL:DR Well designed power user/gamer/VR laptop with decent hardware for the price! Works with Oculus Quest 2.I’m a power user: 3D CAD, 2D CAD, graphic design, video editing…all at the same time as I’ll use the same graphics between them all! I also use it with my Oculus Quest to play Steam games and it works flawlessly! Good hardware packed into the price. Great value. It's ready for Windows 11 too but I think I'll wait a few years for MS to finish it before upgrading haha. The build quality is great and if you are a gamer the TURBO button will overclock the machine without you having to do anything. Great gaming laptop for the price hands-down!",0
"This device features a pressure-sensitive touchpad that intelligently reacts to the amount of pressure you apply, enhancing your interactive experience.",1
"(Muy buena!!): Es muy rápida en el encendido, aunque tiene poco DDS y Memoria RAM pero su procesador es de ultima generación. Corre los programas sin problema y ya viene con win 11. El envio llego en fecha y en muy bien estado",0
(Impresionante calidad y desempe?o a un precio competitivo): Muy buen producto,0
"(Good product (after 1 year)): It is a nice, neat, light, and relatively high-performance laptop. I do my student works like using MATLAB, Solidworks, etc. as well as playing some not graphically heavy video games. Its light, compact and the battery life is fair enough. After a while I stopped suing the touch screen as a second monitor, since I bought an actual one. But overall its a good one :)",0
(Returning): Returning. The mouse function continuously fails.,0
"(The devise is very useful and is in great condition.): When I get the device out of the box while setting it up I noticed the bottom was not secure, but outside of that it is a nice computer.",0
(Love it!): The first computer I've had that will allow me to play my The Sims 3 base game and all 11 of expansion/stuff packs at the same time!,0
"(Touchpad was an issue): For people having problems with the touchpad on this laptop try installing the latest drivers.I had several problems: mouse pointer wasn't moving, the it created several phantom inputs and movements, it was a complete mess.Now after getting the latest drivers (Version V11.0.0.30 from July 2019) none of the problems above had happened again.",0
(Fast but quiet): The speakers are not top quality and a little bit of a bummer for a college student.,0
"(Five Stars): Very easy to set up,Chromebooks are the way to go,and this one performs excellent!!Very much recommended!!",0
"(This is the worst piece of garbage I've ever bought): This is the worst piece of garbage I've ever bought. If it wasn't such a hassle to send back, I would. So therefore I'm going to take a sledgehammer to it. Extremely dissatisfied!!!!",0
"(Hardware is good, software not so much): This is perhaps the best example of Google having great fundamental ideas but screwing it up with poor execution in small areas, that ruins aspects of the overall experience. The meager and awkward file management app and user experience, combined with the small screen, will leave you wishing for Windows on a larger screen. If you do a lot of file management, especially with USB drives, you should experience this in person before buying.Sign-ins are also highly convoluted. If you add a second account (it slows down the entire laptop in my experience) and another person needs to sign-in then you are required to enter your entire Google password and not just the pin you created. Often logging in with your phone just does not work. If you have Bluetooth off and turn it on to log-in it almost always does not work and you then have to type in your likely long password, if you can remember it without using your password manager on your phone, etc.The baked-in Chrome browser will also not load my homepages upon start, but a new tab. I don't have that problem using Chrome browser on my desktop windows PC where it loads the three pages I need when I launch Chrome.The hardware is good for the price. Zippy little machine. Keyboard is useable but nothing special. Screen is useable but nothing special. Speakers are not as bad as reviews say but certainly nothing special. The trackpad is useable but nothing special. The laptop stays cool and quiet and the battery lasts for a long time. It's not crazy lightweight, but light and small enough to still be ultraportable.I don't know if having two user accounts is known to slow down a Chromebook but I know that having two on mine did slow it down. After setting up the second it felt slower and after removing the second things went back to being zippy immediately. Using a webstore app called ""Cog"" I also saw higher ram usage with two accounts, like it was perhaps storing both in ram while only actively using one.I was able to plug in my old HP wired printer and use that no problem, no extra apps needed. Just selected a wired USB printer in settings. I was not going to buy a Chromebook and be required to buy another printer as many of the more expensive Chromebooks would have required. Ridiculous. I might have bought that $450 Asus convertible had I also not had to spend another $70 on a new printer.",0
"(Great Laptop Computer!): Lenovo Computer ReviewI’m no IT guru, so this is a total non-techy user review. I’ve owned and used this laptop computer September of 2021, and I love it! It was well past time for an upgrade, and I spent a lot of time looking at laptops, trying to decide what fit my needs and wants best. I narrowed it down to a few from Asus, Dell, Acer, and Lenovo. Even though this is marketed as a gaming laptop, it’s important to note that I am not a computer guru, nor am I a gamer. I don’t own a single game, so I can’t review it from that standpoint. I simply wanted a computer for everyday computing and web surfing, managing my music collection, editing photos, and running my telescopes (astronomy is one of my hobbies.)For my purposes, this computer is fast! It boots up in just a few seconds. The graphics are great! Being able to change the keyboard backlighting color is a great feature for me. Astronomy is a hobby of mine, so my keyboard lighting is red, since I don’t want bright light sources ruining my dark-adapted night vision when I'm using the laptop with my telescopes at night.No computer is perfect, and I do have a few minor nit-picks with this one, though there are none that I find unacceptable. First, this computer came with ABSOLUTELY NO DOCUMENTATION! No manual, printed or otherwise. Not even a quick-start guide. No CD with a manual or utilities. All you get in the box is the laptop and the power cord/AC adapter. In spite of the lack of documentation, it was pretty easy for me to power it up and start using it. Next, the AC adapter is very bulky, compared to the ones that come with most other laptops. It’s about 6”x 3”x 1”, it’s heavy for its size, and it’s situated in the middle of the power cord. I will say that the power cord is quite long, which is good. The power cord plugs into the back of the unit, rather than on the side. There’s only one USB port on right side of the computer, and there’s a USB-C port and a headphone jack on the left side. I would have preferred two side USB ports, but there are three more on the back of the unit, along with a HDMI port, another USB-C port, and a LAN connection. There’s plenty of connectability, if you don’t mind most of it being on the back of the unit. The speakers sound like typical laptop speakers, and I think it’s silly to expect much more than that. I use headphones, Bluetooth speakers, or I just Bluetooth my music from the laptop to my home stereo system. Last, the battery doesn’t last long as long as I’d like, but that’s to be expected from a computer with the high-end processing and graphics capability this computer has. For every day, non-gaming use, I get about two-and-a-half to three hours of use from the battery before I need to recharge it. If you need portability power, you’d do well to use all of the power saving settings, have an alternate power supply to plug into, or an extra battery, or consider another computer altogether. Again, none of these are things that cause me any real issues, but they might for others. In spite of them all, I do love this machine!One of the things about this computer that was a big selling point for me is that it was sold directly by Amazon, rather than a third-party vendor on Amazon. I hear a lot of hard luck stories from folks who bought computers from third-party vendors who had a tough time either getting warranty service for computers with problems, or returning them for refunds. And a lot of computers offered by third-party vendors have been modified by those vendors. I read a lot of reviews from customers of a lot of those units, complaining of inferior parts being used for the mods. Luckily for me, I had no desire to return my computer, nor have I had any functionality issues with it. But when I have had to return anything to Amazon, it’s always been a no-hassle experience for me. And to top it off, the Amazon price on this computer was less than that offered directly from Lenovo.What I like:Looks great!It’s fast! Boots up in only a few seconds.Graphics are top notch.WIFI and Bluetooth work wellKeyboard backlighting colors are changeable (red is my preference)10-key pad on keyboard (I use this a lot!)Sold directly by Amazon (at least it was when I bought mine)What I don’t like:NO documentationThe battery could last longerMost of the connectivity ports are on the back of the computerBulky AC adapterAnnoying occasional sales nags from McAfee and Microsoft. Fairly easily removed.",0
(great laptop): Awesome Laptop... Easy to use for Non Technical people... And Excellent price..,0
(Mouse/Printer): Having mouse and printer problems,0
"(Awesome): Great computer, use it everyday",0
(Excellent device for easy internet usage): Purchased for my father as a replacement to his original Chromebook,0
"(Great Computer!): Durable, user friendly, compatitble with many programs.",0
"(great performance, bad resolution): this computer is great for the price especially.The only issue we have with it is the display is very poor.the computer gets 5 stars but the resolution on the display gets 2 or3 at the most.not great for streaming, but we bought it to do work in the home office and its great for that.",0
"(No hassle with updates from Windows.): Best choice , easy to use",0
"(Outstanding desktop replacement; Competent gamer): This button-down dark gray HP laptop will spend the majority of its time doing algorithm driven stock index futures trading. For that task, it really has the Right Stuff; wired gigabit ethernet port, world beater office task performance, a bright, crisp 1K display, and the ability to drive a 4K external monitor to its full potential. Sometimes I'll bring this machine with me and the fact that its appearance has about a zero ""Star Wars coefficient"" is totally a plus. I like the keyboard, its nice white backlighting, and overall style and build of this machine.I can think of many ways this laptop could be better. It could have a magnesium aluminum alloy or even a carbon fiber case. It could have a 14-hour battery life. It could have a state-of-the-art graphics card. It could have multiple TB of NVMe storage. It could have a 4K OLED screen that displays colors that can only be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope. And none of that would add anything to the value of this very capable laptop for the missions I have for it.At $699 on an Amazon flash sale, it represents an incredible value. When I had the back cover off to install a 32 GB RAM upgrade, I was very happy with the overall build quality plus the fact that this model came with the larger 72WH battery. And the back cover is held down by 7 Phillips screws of equal length. Some designer at HP should receive an international award in industrial design for just accomplishing that. As a great value, this thing is off the charts even at typical asking price.",0
(Worst laptop ever!!): Ever since I've had it and that's not long I've had nothing but problems with wifi connection and downloading anything and now I've reset it and can't get anything to download on it al all. I should have sent it back right after I got it and I guess it's too late now. I got totally ripped off and need another laptop now. I shouldn't have tried to go cheap. You get what you pay for.,0
"(Great for the the Price): I am happy with my purchase it handles the games I play Perfectly. The fan can be load when set at max, but if you are using headphones you won't notice it. After a while I even tone it out. The fans keep it really cool. Getting the back cover off to do upgrades can be a little difficult because of clips that hold it on. The speakers are ok as with the built in web cam. It is best to be plugged in while using the battery only last a couple of hours. Overall For the ram and graphics card it comes with and the price it is worth it.",0
(BACK LIGHT KEYBOARD DOES NOT WORK!!!!): FN+F9 Combinations does not light up the keyboard,0
"It's thin, light, and powerful.",0
"(You get what you pay for): It's a cute and useful little laptop, however the memory isn't good. As soon as I started using it it told me it didn't have enough storage for updates.",0
"(Ilke the size perfect for me): Ilke the size perfect for me, there are things that I can't download or I have to really search something equal but I have enjoyed it",0
(Love it!): It is everything I wanted in a laptop. It’s easy to use .All you have to do from the box is open the lid and your up and running,0
"(Love this): I'm not a PC person or very techy, but I got this laptop with assistance from my partner to try to get into PC gaming and to have a reliable laptop for work (as I travel for work). This has been a delight to use and easy to learn.",0
(It’s good for gaming): It’s good for gaming it’s really good for gaming but the batterrey life is so bad like a iPhone 2 is better battery life,0
"(5 Months in and ASUS actually helped): After 5 months the laptop keyboard lights up, but no screen or boot attempt. Just hear fans cycling and the keyboard is just red. Id expect a laptop like this to last a few years before having problems. Never moved from my desk since opening it. Vastly disappointed.Update: Spoke to the customer support and they walked me through a driver reset and it resolved my issue. I was surprised how easy of a fix it was. Thank goodness no need to ship it in or go to a repair shop.",0
"(Great value and an excellent alternative to a MacBook if budget is limited.): Excellent value even with import tax, very fast, light and great quality. You will need a 2 to 3 pin adaptor for the UK and of course it’s got a US keyboard layout but that’s not really a problem.",0
"(Good Value): This is a good value all around. I was concerned about the screen quality because others complained. If you get the vertical viewing angle right the screen is bright and the color is rich. I am happy with the purchase. It is lightweight, boots very fast and came with almost no bloatware. Speakers are weak but adequate to play background music while working. If you want to play music loud get a bluetooth speaker.",0
(Mejor ir a una tienda física): Me tocó regresarla,0
(Backspace key sticks!): So far I'm liking it. The only issue I've had so far is the backspace key sticks frequently--otherwise I would give it 5 stars.,0
The built-in camera and microphone provide excellent quality for videoconferencing and other AV needs.,0
"(Five Stars): Amazing Laptop, cant be more satisfied :)",0
"(Great Laptop): My grandson uses this for school and gaming, it works nicely for his needs.",0
"(Amazing): Dears, thank you, it is amazing laptop ? works exelent.",0
"(It's a great machine, but with weak build quality): Laptop is incredibly fragile. Fan broke, pieces of the edges tore off... Just a mess.",0
"(i like ACER): I like ACER but I had to return this E 5 because it would not boot us successful upon opening the box. I got an error message to repair the machine.Needless to say my old ACER aspire V5- 561P-6869 was and is a great machine, but now succumbs to overheating and turning off after 20 minutes or so. I wish that I could find one I trusted",0
"(Great build, Performs like advertised): The 165Hz refresh is amazing. Runs mostly silently and fans noise isn't that noticeable when gaming. Stays cool and performs like a champ. Great Laptop!",0
viewing angles are wide since its IPS and i couldn't detect any light bleeding on the edges,0
"(Great for video editing): We bought this for video editing and it has been amazing. Screen, CPU, GPU, and cooling have been great (considering my city's weather is very hot). Only big downside I have noticed is the poor battery life. Doing some file management and browsing only gives me around 2h. I activated hybrid mode and I think it improved, but haven't tested it enough to recommend it.It does not have an SD Card Reader, so I suggest buying the HooToo 7 in 1 Type C Hub that goes for around $20.Overall, great laptop. Will update this review in case I need to.",0
"(Very disappointing): Runs games quite well, however the laptop acts as if there is no battery in it. It won't power on if unplugged and immediately shuts down if unplugged. I would expect these sort of issues with a cheap laptop, but this one was very expensive.Their support team's only option is RMA, which takes 10 days not counting shipping. Rather than go over 2 weeks without a computer, I think I'll go with a different brand, like MSI.",0
"(Phenomenal machine for any type of work except heavy graphics rendering and such): Arrived in excellent condition, completely unscratched. Everything works as intended.",0
"(The screen sux): Not sure if I got bad one, but the screen is so much crappier than my old acer cb311 IPS. I can't find an angle where the blacks don't turn to blues and there's a noticeable gradient (light at the bottom to negative black at the top).Everything else seems fine. It's all plastic and has a dumb glossy bezel and the screen is terrible and I like my old one better but it's an ok piece of equipment I guess.",0
A little heavier than I expected,0
Keyboard is responsive.,0
"(Read the Negative Reviews Before Purchasing): If you read the negative reviews, you will see that this computer has problems. The Wi-Fi keeps dropping and you have to dig deep into the computer to restore it to only have it occur a day later. Also, the screen size is small and if you are older, it will be hard to read unless you bump the document size up. You should also know that if you do have the Wi-Fi problem with the computer and return it within the timeframe that Amazon sets, the seller will charge you a 20% restocking fee.",0
"(USB ports stuck things, one of them unable to remove mouse, otherwise good): So this is a typical gaming laptop, but I seem to have gotten the one with bad USB ports. While I managed to wiggle a mouse free (which works fine in every other computer) in most USB ports, one of them is permanently stuck. I pulled out the inner receiver but the metal part stayed in the laptop. I need to send it back to the manufacturer since I can't open it since it's still in warranty.Also, the Asurion thing will prevent you from upgrading the RAM. So you're stuck with this for 5 years at what you bought it, with NO UPGRADES",0
"(Does not have touch screen): Does not hsve touch screen, works fine with mouse",0
(great): I really recommend it,0
"(Great product, but bad QC issues): Great product at first, but the laptop's screen soon stopped turning on less than a day in.",0
"(... they have been abused (literally) and are still in good shape, like new): I bought 2 of them almost a year ago and they have been abused (literally) and are still in good shape, like new. My daughters love these computers. The only thing I have not figured out is how to calibrate the screen color temperature. If someone can help me on that, I will appreciate it.",0
"(I love my chromebooks and i have both): this chromebook was perfect, better than a new one not a mark on it anywheres, and it works the way a chromebook should. the one i bought from amazon 2 years ago e works good but I wanted one for a spare and amazon filled the bill.Thank you amazon!!! It came in two days.",0
(Go for it!): So pleased with this purchase.,0
(Not enough memory): Not near enough memory,0
"(Not recommend): After 9 months of using, it’s dead. It does not completely turn on or turn down. The power indicator is blinking, and I can hear the running sound, but that’s it.",0
"(Dell Inspiron 15|AMD Ryzen 5 2500U): Crisp graphics, light weight, excellent price for a nice, mid-range system. The mousepad and keyboard are responsive. What impressed me out of the box was how quickly and easily it set up, including the requisite security and system updates. Some bloat needed to be removed, but not much.Only time will tell about its staying power. Will report back any fails.",0
"(It's not a good computer): What I don't like is that every few months there's an update which crashes my computer. Up until now I fixed it with recover. At this point, 6 months in, it is totally crashed with a stop code. I'm trying to get support but the serial number are these tiny numbers on the motherboard which don't distinguish between 0 and 0. I am so disappointed in this product!",0
"(nice laptop): this laptop is light, thin and has a big enough screen to watch prime movies. the only down flaw is that it did not come with the right and left keys to correct my miss spelling of words.",0
"(Great when it's on sale): I really enjoyed my purchase of this laptop, everything works well but the battery life isn't very good unless you use it for the bare minimum on the lowest power settings available. For 999 plus tax it was an excellent purchase but now that the price went up I'd probably look for other options on that price range. Very satisfied nonetheless",0
"(Not compatible with most games): The only games that i've been able to run on this computer are either FPS shooters, or easy to run games like Stardew Valley. I've tried to launch several games on here, and it crashed a majority of the time, especially with simple games like ""The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"". If it weren't the only computer I could own, I would have gladly gotten a different one.",0
(as expected): i used this to drive a digical sign,0
(great build quality): affordable price (?) great screen and speakerif it were non glare panel and non-touchscreeni thought it was the best windows laptop,0
(Not good): Bought this Amazon warehouse item. Doesn’t work right. Noise from speakers Slugs. Must have been a return not an open boxNow I have a very nice brick.Never buy tech again from Amazon warehouse,0
"(Excellent value!): The Lenovo Flex 6 with 14 inches HD LCD IPS panel with touch screen reviewed here has impressive features that really works well. The best part is the affordability in this crowded convertible PC market. It can also function as “Tablet PC” thanks to its 360 degrees swivel design and with the optional pen; you can get creative with included software. Even without a pen, the touch screen registers simple & multi-touch gestures really well. Once you get accustomed using touch screen, you will see that using this PC becomes very intuitive.In this price range, the Lenovo Flex 6 offers a very well balanced mix of features, which you can find only on premium priced laptops, which I find a major benefit in this new 2018 model. The laptop’s LCD panel is good with high-resolution full HD display and the Yoga-like design makes it possible to use it as a tablet as well as in a tent type for viewing multimedia. The speakers are excellent for a laptop of this size and are ‘Harman Kardon’ branded boasting Dolby Audio premium sound.The display’s bezel (only on three sides) is actually quite thin for a laptop that is quite affordable. Actually looks high-end. Granted there is about 1 inch or thicker bezel at the bottom of the display but I found this larger than normal bottom bezel useful as this prevents your fingers coming in view while you type. The camera is on the top and has a white light to indicate its ON. Lenovo has apps that allow you to disable camera from the taskbar. You could also cover it using a thin black electrical tape! Webcam camera is 720p, which works great with Microsoft Skype.The keyboard has adjustable brightness enabled back-lighting and provides comfortable scalloped type of keys that you tend to find only on high-end laptops. The keyboard also has a row of multimedia keys and provides easy access to volume, display, and host of other functions with minimal effort. The touch-pad is actually very responsive and features multiple gestures compatible with Windows 10. Scrolling effortlessly using two fingers, minimizing to desktop using 3-finger grab all works great.The laptop also has a fingerprint sensor, which is Windows 10 “Hello” capable, which I found very useful. The quality of the laptop is better than expected for the offered price range, it does not feel like cheap plastic and the brushed metal look gives the laptop a high-class look. This is of course little heavy but relatively thin laptop. It weighs in at 3.5 pounds and about 18mm thick.The laptop is very snappy, all the included applications worked right out of the box; there was no hanging, lagging and there were no crashes. The review sample given to me had Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz, with 16GB of DDR4 RAM (SK Hynix HMA82GS6CJR8N-VK); The SSD had a capacity of 256GB, which is a M.2 type model number HFS256GD9TNG-62A0A (SK Hynix.) Granted, it is not the best M.2 “PCIe SSD” currently in the market but in my tests, I found out that the Windows 10 OS boots in under 15 seconds, which I consider plenty, fast enough for a laptop of this price range.The motherboard had a built-in Intel HD VGA (620), which drives the LCD panel, also a GeForce MX130 discrete sitting on PCI Express x4 Gen3 bus, dedicated video memory 2048 MB of GDDR5 type: Realtek 8822BE Wireless LAN 802.11ac PCI-E NIC. Wi-Fi Wireless. You also have Bluetooth 4.1 for file transfers and audio device pairing. The laptop has 'secure boot' enabled, also has a TPM module, which gives Windows 10 the cryptographic operations. This also means it is harder to tamper using malicious software, which is good for you as a customer & the hardware manufacturer (Lenovo) & software provider (Microsoft).PROS:[+] Good build quality, feels sturdy, does not look cheap! Touchpad works great![+] LCD panel is good quality, FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS multi-touch anti-glare and good viewing angles.[+] Battery life is better than average, works for about eight hrs. Also has fast charging options![+] Boots fast under 15 seconds, wakes up fast too. Has fingerprint sensor with Hello compatible![+] All included applications worked right out of the box, No hangs or crashes![+] Tablet PC mode is a plus. You can do creative things using the optional pen.[+] You can double your laptop as a gaming device using XBOX app from Microsoft[+] Has USB-C port, Always ON USB 3.0 port for charging your phone. Has HDMI port, SD card slot.[+] Has a standard 3.5mm audio combo jack perfect for wired headphones & gaming headsetsCONS:[-] Little bit heavy at 3.5 pounds[-] The discrete graphics GeForce MX130 is not compatible with Microsoft mixed Reality (VR)Even with the very few minor CONs listed above, which I have discovered thus far, the laptop is very capable looks good and feels good in hand, It is otherwise fully functional thereby not affecting my overall impression. I however caution you that you need to get the “top-most” model ""81EM000DUS"" or better offered here. Please note that Lenovo makes laptops that are affordable for the masses but please do not get too stingy trying to save additional $200 on the low-end model in the Flex-6 series, please make yourself a favor and get the",0

(Very Happy): I am very pleased with my purchase!,0
"(Excellent, top notch laptop): I have an ""old"" 2018 model. But this one is one step forward than that. It is more compact yet you feel it is bigger. Excellent screen and touch pad. Happy with this purchase.",0
"(I love this laptop1): I wanted a screaming fast laptop and this one delivers! The 11th generation i7 chip really delivers. It can easily handle Zoom, databases, Office 365 all at the same time with no issues. Plus, the changing-cool keyboard is cool! I'm not a gamer, but I need a gamer-level machine for all that I do. Highly recommend the Pulse for the price and the features. It's much cheaper than the new Surface laptop and has a bigger display,.",0
"(Lightweight, but at the cost of flimsiness): Bottom line is that it is a decent machine. Runs quickly, good resolution, and great battery life. Very light and portable! But that lightness comes with a feeling of flimsiness with the laptop. The plastic bends really easily and I worry that it wouldn't survive a shock or two to the system like I've put some other laptops through. Also, not a big fan of the small plug... it feels like it will snap in half the first time it gets tested. Still, for the money, not too bad.",0

"(already need to replace it after 10 months of use): I am disappointed in this product. I had an Acer Chromebook that I used for about 4 years. I wanted a bigger screen size and it was starting to slow down, so i replaced it with this model. For the past few months iot has been shutting off while I am using it. It now happens so frequently that it's basically useless. I've already ordered an HP Chromebook. Hope I have better luck with that .",0
"The constant crashes when it switched video cards, and my favorite constant blue screens of death from the NVIDIA driver no matter what I did, reformatting, clean install nothing.",0
(That’s the computer is working very well and u got someone to help u when u first started): Everything is perfect,0
"(Bad Quality Control): The 1 star is for the poor quality control by Acer.I received the laptop and immediately started to set it up. Upon entering my info I noticed that the D key was not working. I put in a call to Acer tech support and have to send the laptop in to get repaired... the brand new out of the box product. Now I have to repackage everything, wait for a shipping label, drop it off and wait 7-10 business days (fancy wording for two weeks) instead of working on projects that I bought the laptop for. So at this point I am very disappointed in Acer’s quality control.I can’t really review the laptop itself since it was defective from the start. I’m hoping that is the only issue with the machine as most reviews I’ve read about the Nitro 5 are positive.Update: It has been 22 days since I received the brand new laptop from Amazon. Acer repair has had the laptop for 14 days now and I still have not received any info about the status of my case other than it is still being repaired. I am not happy about having to wait 3+ weeks to have a brand new working laptop.",0
(Very fast excellent graphics): My son uses it for all his gaming the value is Awesome and fair,0
(Solid laptop choice): Good product. Shipped quickly and arrived earlier than expected. Highly recommend.,0
(Stop working after 1 hours): The worse buy in 20 years ina AMAZON.SELLER DONT REPLY.AMAZON DONT HELP ME WITH THE SELLERTHIS WAS THE WORSE STAR IN 2021 FOR ME,0
"(Can’t beat the price!): Great computer overall! My main issue with it is that when running games like Fortnite for example, it will tend to overheat, and the fans are loud af. So just be prepared for that. Good specs. Fast computer! Definitely good deal for your money!",0
(if only): There is much to like about this computer but what I don't like is that it broke 35 day in and I never was offered an extended warranty when I purchased it. I bought it because my other new laptop broke (different brand and my fault). So I'm very disappointed.,0
(Samsung Chrime Book Laptop): This is a Christmas gift for my husband so it hasn't been used yet. From looking at it though - it looks very well made - good quality and really slim/compact. I love it so far!,0
"(Excellent gaming laptop for the price): The system performs quite well and easily handles any game I have tried to play on it. The battery performance during gaming isn't great, but 144hz refresh rate and power consumption of the video card during gaming does whittle the battery performance down fairly quickly. However when used for school and maxed out for battery performance, to include restricting to a 60hz refresh rate, the system easily lasts and entire day at school for my son without needing to be plugged in to recharge.",0
(Spec'd to have 3200 MHz Ram ... It is actually locked @ 2666 MHz): Spec'd to have 3200 MHz Ram ... when it actually is locked @ 2666 MHz. That's a big problem.,0
"(Good product for gaming, battery not so much): After using the product for over a year I can safely say that it was a good purchase. Running most modern games at high or medium settings, it does it's job well enough. However, considering it has a dedicated graphics card in it. The battery life will drain rather fast when unplugged. Also, considering this product is a budget gaming laptop. It obviously won't be able to compete with products above it in specs.",0
"(Nearly perfect. Battery life could be better.): It's possibly the best laptop I've ever owned by a landslide. It's honestly the best gaming laptop you could get. The price has gone up a little since I purchased it but it is still worth the money. Other laptops with the same specs have you paying almost double. One bad this I can say is that the battery life is poor as it usually is with these types of machines; I wish the manufacturer would provide better batteries but that would only bring up the price. Aside from that, it's an excellent laptop.",0
"(The wrong laptop all because of one sticker *EDIT* A Gaming Monster!): I just got my laptop which is suppose to have RBG keyboard lighting but, instead I got its $1099 version all because of a sticker. I made sure I bought the correct model I wanted and I also checked the box. What was messed up was that there was another sticker over the original box which shad the info of some of the specs and what model it is. What I got the the PH315 52 78VL while the model I wanted was the PH 315 52 72RG. How can they mess this up?! If they double checked both stickers this wouldn’t have been a problem.*EDIT* 11/24/2019:So this basically how my return went. I talked to Amazon and the only thing that they could do is let me return the package and once it got to their facility is when they can refund me. I live in Hawaii so the time it got to Amazon took awhile and it wasn't priority shipping. Took around a week. Anyway I was displeased about waiting that long that but I understand since I live quite a bit aways.So after getting my refund, and reordering the same exact laptop from the same seller, they finally gave me the right laptop in about 3 days. After using the laptop for a couple weeks a few things right off the bat is that this gaming on this laptop is amazing. For reference, I was playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare on Ultra settings on every little thing I can get put it on and I was able to max 150 fps but average about 110-120 fps on turbo mode. Without turbo mode, you would a get a solid 90 fps. Keep in mind while using turbo, increases how loud the laptop gets with its fans and it can get pretty loud. ALSO FOR THOSE WONDERING YOU CAN USE VR WITH THIS LAPTOP. I was able to play VR Chat with the Oculus Quest with the Oculus Link software and a 3rd party USB 3.0 cable. Runs like a dream but have to test more games withing the PC Oculus App and try Steam VR soon. The camera quality, mic quality, and speaker quality are all sub-par but, it is a gaming laptop so I had no issues with all of these since it could be fixed with a webcam if needed and most gamers would use a headset with a mic anyway.On the outside, this PC can get hot especially on the keyboard but, wasn't bothersome for me. The fans vents are placed on both sides of the laptop and not under, releasing quite a bit of heat. Also I found that the charging port seems to block the left fan vent, so to give the laptop optimal cooling I just placed the laptop on the side of a desk and just flipped the charger downwards. When it comes to battery life with this laptop, it runs well on gaming when plugged in. However, gaming without a charging really drains the battery. Gave me about 2 hours although I could've lowered the brightness, turned off the rgb keyboard, and set the battery to ""Best battery life"" rather then ""Best performance"". The keyboard took a bit of getting used to. Coming from a 15"" macbook pro was not too bad. I say this because Acer added the keypad on the right of laptop and sort squishing the regular keyboard making it a smaller. than the macbook keys. I was a bit put off by it but easily got used to it and can type just as fast as I did before.Other than that, I would've gave this overall view 4 because of the mishap in the beginning of this purchase but because I was very impressed on how well the laptop runs , I give it a 5/5. It is a great gaming laptop by all means and if you want to upgrade the hard drive storage you're able to. It can be used as a regular everyday laptop and give significant amount of battery life (on the right settings). When it comes to a gaming this has to be by far one of the best bang for your buck laptops out there.",0
(Would buy again): Good speed,0
"(This was a great little laptop...until today's Microsoft announcement.): This is a low CPU power/minuscule RAM/tiny disk space laptop that is very limited in usability and NOT hardware upgradeable. If you need something to check email, browse the web, and maybe stream a video, AND you understand that this isn't a regular laptop for doing real work on, then this may be just what you need. I use it only to interface with my cars computer. The change from Win 10s to regular Win10 Home is super easy and a non issue. What is the issue is that today Microsoft announced that Microsoft's latest Windows 10 update (version 1903), coming out in May will need almost double the storage space than it did last time for its October 2018 Update (version 1809). Users running the 32-bit version see the requirement jump from 16GB to 32GB and those running the 64-bit version also need a minimum of 32GB, an additional 12GB of space from the previous baseline of 20GB. And that's the total of what this little laptop has. That means that the OS may not be upgraded or if it does, there will be nowhere to store ANY apps. You could use a thumb drive, but this is if the OS will install at all with a 32gb drive. One may be left with the pre-installed OS and no upgrades (think security and bug fixes) in the future. If you buy it, just be aware of this machine total limitations.",0

"(No es pantalla tactil, pero si esta muy buen equipada): Buena opcion en calidad-precio, la pantalla no es tactil pero tiene buena visualizacion y es una computadora bien equipada",0
"(So many issues: audio, random shut downs, battery life - bad purchase): I've had this laptop about 18 months and it's been a really bad purchase.If I allow the screen to go black after inactivity after a few minutes (Standard laptop/computer operating) there is a high likelihood that I will have to manually restart the computer by holding down the power button until it shuts down and then restart it.^THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED ISSUE - IT HAPPENS TO MANY USERS^I had to send it away after about 11 months because the battery charging port had become loose so I couldn't charge the laptop. Thankfully that was in warranty but I still had to pay a hefty shipping fee to Acer.^ I subscribed to a year warranty and just about got it in before that ran out - i was quoted $100's of dollars for what should have been a simple repair at local stores - hopefully you are more savvy than me, but I also got lucky ^It came back with a screw missing where the screen hinges to the base and it's probably going to get worse and worse (looking for a solve - but testament to the shoddy workmanship and care).The audio is one of the most frustrating elements, two tiny speakers are placed on the bottom at the sides. This means that sound is easily muffled and pointing away from the user, awful design on top of little power means that headphones are a constant must have.I often have to disconnect and reconnect to the internet several times before it actually gets an internet connection (at home, where it should always be connected).Long story longer: don't buy this laptop, it's flimsy, the sound is terrible, and unreliable.",0
"(Great Purchase!): I love this MacBook! The battery life is amazing and I have been able to complete work tasks easily. I love the size because I can carry the MacBook when I travel without having to use a big laptop bag. The screen quality is great, but I had a little difficulty seeing the screen outside in a sunny area. Although, when I found some shade I had no problems at all. I am not outside much in the sun on the MacBook so this isn’t a big deal for me. Overall, great product in my opinion. It is perfect for what I need to do for work.",0
(The quality is not good.): Speakers are shot. Product support is from chat only - will only get updates if you check the chat every day. I should have bought a Mac. Will never buy another Dell.,0

"(AMD wins again!): At the request of a relative, I decided to give the new AMD processors a try. Wow! This computer is so much faster than the Lenovo (with Intel) I just bought for my wife. May buy another one of these for the kids to play games and do homework on.",0
"(Banged up instead of renewed): Extremely slow booting up, scratches, dents and dead spots on the screen. I have purchased renewed laptops from Amazon before but never this bad of quality. This laptop shouldn't be considered renewed and is misleading",0
"(Just because it’s “Brand new” doesn’t mean it won’t have issues): I purchased this computer back at the end of March and since then, I’ve had issues with the computer. For example, there are days I cannot use the computer longer than 5 minutes before it randomly restarts. I don’t dare to take an exam in my laptop or even watch a zoom lecture because it will most likely restart and I will have logged off my exam and zoom meeting. I tried to fix it multiple times but nothing seems to work. And then, out of nowhere, the screen broke (after research it seems like this can happen to Microsoft’s newer computers). I never had any kind of issues with my Apple computer and am regretting this purchase.",0
"(Great for basic usage as-is, but better if you make some minor upgrades): I bought this for a young child when it was on sale during Prime Day. We already had a 15"" Vivobook and like the brand/model. After receiving the laptop, I was happily surprised that the screen is better than the 15"" Vivobook we bought in 2020. Screen is crisp and bright and you can't see pixels or dots. The laptop is light and compact, but just be aware you won't have 10-key touch as a trade-off for the size.It came pre-installed with Windows 11 S mode. I've never had experience with S mode and it was slightly annoying to uninstall and convert to Windows 11 Home. I knew it only had 4GB of RAM, but it surprisingly wasn't too sluggish. It's enough for basic web browsing with a few tabs open, but it'll probably be slow if you have background processes and updates running at the same time. I immediately added 8GB of RAM for a total of 12GB and could notice an improvement. Usually the harddrive is a bottleneck, but that's not an issue with this laptop's NVMe M.2 drive. 128GB is enough for what we use it for, but it's nice to know you have an SSD slot open for future upgrades, or just swap out the M.2 drive. There is no SD or MicroSD card reader, so you'll need to use a USB drive or adapter if that's important to you. The 15"" Vivobook does have a MicroSD slot, so I was disappointed that they didn't include it with this 14"" laptop.I've bought budget laptops before, but this is one of the best ones in terms of screen quality, fast hardware, and weight & feel. If you're considering a Chromebook for your child's schoolwork, I think this is a better alternative, as I've found most cheap Chromebooks to be too small and limiting in their abilities.",0

I was using a custom upgraded 2010 macbook pro and it was having a hard time keeping up, fans constantly came on and the thing burned my lap it got so hot. This computer's fans are hardly noticeable, and hardly ever boot on. The speakers are PHENOMENAL, I love listening to music while I work and this has been a great addition to my workspace. I also use a second monitor and it looks great plugged into another screen. The viewing angles aren't the greatest, but you really can't beat what you get for the price.

I don't use the laptop for gaming but my web based work and stuff I do on excel is quick and responsive. I like the build quality. I don't care for the track pad since it's shifted a bit to the left. The keyboard action is terrible and I find it very hard to type. I'm sure I'll get used to it. I'm used to my Dell Latitude E7270. I think the Dell has better colors on the screen.,0

The first two or three times I booted it up, it was slow because of software updates, but since then, it's been good and fast. I purchased this laptop mainly for photo editing; it works well with Photoshop Elements. The description says the keyboard is backlit, but mine is not. Not a feature that's important to me, but it may be to some. I especially like the 17-inch screen combined with the portability of a laptop.",0

"(GREAT LAPTOP FOR HOME): I have been using this laptop for a month and some change which I tried video editing, graphic design, and gaming.Surprisingly performed well for games like Control, Alan Wake, Valorant, Gears 5, A Plagues Tale, & recently The Medium (side not The Medium was on High).I have not experience any lagging but the track pad sometime doesn't follow so I just got a mouse.The battery is about a few hours with little performance things but demanding things definitely require the charger.The keyboard has a backlit function which is a plusLimited on usb ports but you can get a hub to add more.The webcam is ok.There were times the laptop felt a little hot but to be on the safe side I got a cooling pad and only using full performance when doing demanding work.The final thing that is a drawback if your gaming/video editing and NEVER like to manage space, the storage is pretty small when you consider game sizes and video sizes. So I would recommend getting an External HDD with a few TB to save money but if you got money to spare and speed is a big thing to you....External SSD with at least 2 TB.Overall I highly recommend this laptop if your trying to get into mid- demanding work like video editing at 1080p (havent tried 4k). Look at reviews on YouTube, they go into further detail. I've attached a little video I edited of Alan Wake.At this moment in time, I have a gaming mouse, a gaming headset, a cooling pad, a usb hub, a drawing tablet, affinity designer, xbox gaming, steam, unity, and wondershare filmora, with a few games, and an external hdd....still no problems have occurred. It would be a full 5 star if the battery and storage were a bit more but still worth every penny.",0
(Nice looking PC): Nice looking PC.but the battery is very weak I better getting two and a half hours. I was expecting at least five six. Maybe because there is dual Drive. Also display has a very little angle View.,0
"(Incredible gaming in a premium yet portable machine): I have had many laptops over the years but I specifically wanted something for gaming this time around. I am generally a console gamer, but as an active duty sailor I wanted something that was portable that had premium quality aesthetics and would stand the test of time for a few years. I dove deep into the technical workings of laptop gaming and spent countless hours trying to figure out what would be ideal for what I was looking for. I even told myself I wasn’t getting a Dell, but look what happened…I got a dell. And I have absolutely zero regrets. The GPUs responsiveness and the gorgeous effects from the RTX 3070 are just top notch. I couldn’t recommend it anymore.",0
(The trackpad is defective): Like the laptop but the trackpad came out to be defective and Amazon is not ready to replace this item for the lower price which I had bought during the Prime Deal. Hence giving it a 2 star for the worst customer service until now from Amazon,0
"(works as long as no one else is using wifi...): laptop was exactly as expected, brand new with no blemishes.item came the exact day amazon said it would with the regular usps mail. do your research on windows 10S. the ""S"" mode is a feature meant for students in a school or for children or people that constantly click on links that provide malware and viruses to your computer. a quick trip to the windows app store on your laptop, you can take this function off but you can not get it backk.2gigs or ram kinda sucks but for a laptop that cost 153$ i really cant complain.",0
"(An amazing machine, and great quality from this company.): I was taking a risk, as I saw in one answer I saw there was a fingerprint reader. In fact, there IS a fingerprint reader for windows hello.The machine was exactly as desribed, brand new with factory sealed parts and plastic.TOUCHSCREEN 1920x1080! I love this, doesn't drain battery like the 4k model, but still have touchscreeni5 7200u (still plenty fast,)8gb memory128gb ssd (immediately plopped Samsung 950 pro 256 ssd in it)windows fingerprint readerkiller wirelessOverall, couldn't be happier! Don't be scared by the few reviews, it's a great machbattery works perfectly, hinges are very strong, and computer is in pristine, new condition.",0
(DO NOT BUY THIS. STAY AWAY FROM SELLER!): DO NOT BUY THIS CHROMEBOOK! I just bought it and when I turned it on it had someone else's login information on it and he was listed as the owner? This was suppose to be new but I guess that was a lie? I reached out to the seller and have not received any message back. I will keep everyone updated if the situation changes. But stay away from this seller!,0
(Very pleased with this Chromebook): This was bought as a Xmas present. It has met all expectations. Very pleased with this Chromebook.,0
(FRAUD!!!! All the laptops are used not new. The warranty on mine was expired when I received it.): The laptop was buggy from day one. When I tried Lenovo help desk they told me the warranty expired before my date of purchase. Tried contacting the company thinking they might have been scammed too. Their lack of response seems to indicate they're at fault.,0
(Don't): Didn't work upon arrival. I had to press the power button 30+ plus times whenever I tried to turn it on. I tried holding it and called tech support. The battery also only lasted 2 hours.,0
"(Enchanted with the Dragon Spirit!!!!!!!!): I bought this laptop on May 29 and received it on June 8, it took longer than expected to arrive, but it was because it was not in stock. The outer case in perfect condition, comes in a briefcase-type box, which gives it a premium view, everything comes perfectly, the packaging of the accessories is great, the protection for the laptop is very careful. Before buying it I saw many videos about this line of laptops, I read many reviews here on amazon, where they criticized the sound of the speakers, but in my personal experience they sound at a level of 95% without distortion, it is clear crystal clear, the screen is great for this laptop (great refresh rate), the keyboard has multiple options to customize the rgb effects (including turning off the rgb light), it is compatible with steelseries devices for rgb effects, it is also compatible with all devices MSI for rgb effects with MYSTIC LIGHT application (I have keyboard, mouse and MSI monitor, everything works perfect). It takes around 18 seconds to turn on. I have it on a cooling pad and I have not experienced overheating. The webcam is basic, it can be used for virtual classes, conferences and video calls, but for greater clarity, an additional camera is recommended. The sound I said before, it is very very good, but if it is used with headphones or subwoofer speakers, it is even better !!!!! I am happy with this purchase, amazon did an excellent job with shipping and the excellent condition of the product, but MSI did something even better, this laptop has the SPIRIT OF DRAGON in it, it is the best laptop I have ever had.",0
"(Nonfunctional internet drivers): Worked fine for few months and then started loosing internet connection requiring to connect repeatedly.. but now, it won’t connect to internet at all. Tried to get support on chat but wasn’t helpful .. tried resetting etc including factory reset and nothing works.",0
The setup was actually pretty easy.,0
"(good laptop): This laptop replaces one I have had for about 3 years and was fine until my granddaughter spilled her water on just one corner of it, near the power button. this new one is pretty much an identical HP, other than the keyboard is backlit, which is an awesome upgrade!",0
(Chromebooks are not regular computers): You will not be able to download windows programs.. Crossover app does not work on this laptopAll programs in play store are lesser versions of themselves .. i.e photoshop expresswould not recommend,0
"The keyboard lights up and changes colors, which is pretty cool I must say.",0
(Good laptop but did not meet my needs): Could not see very clear as I have low vision. Thank you,0
(Great laptop for productivity.): First MacBook. Everything Runs Smoothly. Battery Life Is Also Excellent. No Complaints.,0
"(Un fiasco): A los 2 meses se apagó y no arrancó más, la garantia de acer no aplica para compras en amazon, mientras la solucion de amazon es devolver el producto para reembolso..",0
(Absolutely awesome Chromebook! Has all the top features to do ...): Absolutely awesome Chromebook! Has all the top features to do anything you want and everything runs fast and smooth. The touchscreen is awesome and the ability to see the screen from all angles is a plus. Highly recommend!,0
The computer gets ridiculously hot and the fans will spin up like a jet engine even when just the browser is running.,0
(I really love it): Perfect For medium specs games,0
APU will thermal throttle under max load,0
"(Brand New MacBook Air): 100% brand new, sealed with all its plastic coverings and everything. Turned it on and so far so good. Arrived in time and in perfect condition. Thanks!",0
it can get pretty loud when playing more intense games.,0
"(Excelente calidad-precio): El teclado es el único detalle malo a destacar, se siente de muy mala calidad, pero por el precio es aceptable.En cuanto a rendimiento y funciones, es muy muy buena, he trabajado con autocad, photoshop, excel, word y chrome al mismo tiempo, y la máquina corre perfectamente, no ha tenido dificultad en esa situación. Tengo ya casi dos meses usándola y no he tenido problemas. La duración de la batería me parece decente.Es un gran equipo con un muy buen costo, muchas computadoras con las mismas especificaciones que estuve comparando son al menos 3,000 pesos más caras.",0
(Good pick): Light weight and solid performer.,0
(Five Stars): Nice screen and keyboard and good size.,0
"(Microsux): My son bought this for himself with my account. He had no idea, granted that’s on him, that this really is an a computer. It’s a Microsoft platform that runs apps only. That means he cannot install Adobe acrobat DC or any other necessary .exe software that he needs for school. My favorite oxymoron, “Microsoft works“… Yeah… Right",0
(cheaper doesn't mean better): the worst laptop ever.,0
(Thanks): Thanks for allowing people like myself to afford such a nice product,0
(As advertised): Best price I've seen. Daughters very happy.. shipping was very fast,0
"(Good quality): Can't really use the HDMI for second screen feature. Pretty reliable computer. Battery life is pretty decent. Screen is small so it is idea for portable situations. Not a big fan of the Lenovo pen (purchased separately). Overall it is a pretty nice device. I would recommend this to college students or home business folks that need easy, get up and go kind of handling.",0
(I SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED THIS SOONER): It is so light weight and easy to to transport. I am still learning all the ins and outs. It is a great little addition to my electronics.,0
"The case is designed with ample drive bays, providing flexibility for future storage upgrades.",1
"A fully foldable laptop, including a foldable screen and keyboard, would be a phenomenal innovation. The ability to fold it into a small pack that fits into a pocket would redefine portability.",1
"(Probably the best laptop I ever owned!): This MSI is quite the little powerhouse, it runs any game I throw at it at a steady 60 FPS with max graphical settings. I initially stress tested it with Doom Eternal, and it was as though I was playing it on my desktop. If there were any differences they were so negligible I didn't notice.On top of that with the 16 gigs of ram as opposed to 8 gigs, which is usually put into gaming laptops, makes multitasking during gameplay a non issue. Whether you're recording gameplay, or listening to spotify, or both!The MSI is also built with metal casing unlike some of it's competitors, such as the Acer Razor, which is pure plastic. This gives it a sturdy feel, and adds a bit of protection.Now, I did say this is a powerhouse so it does suck battery life rather fast. Granted there are options to conserve power, but even then at the very, very most you may get half a dozen hours, but more likely closer to four, or five. This for me isn't a deal breaker since I generally have a power socket nearby, and when I do not it's only for and hour or two max.I will also point out that this machine gets hot, real hot the harder you push it. So I highly suggest using a cooling pad with it.Other than that it's been running magnificently over the last few weeks since I got it. If you're looking for a really good gaming laptop, this is worth the price, and then some.I highly recommend!",0
(Speakers are a joke): My cell phone has louder speakers than this laptop,0
It can handle any game perhaps not at highest settings but it's well worth the money,0
(Very good laptop for gaming and streaming(fortnite/r6 siege with streaming software ...): Very good laptop for gaming and streaming(fortnite/r6 siege with streaming software running at the same time) but like every other gaming laptops it gets HOT that's my only complaint(I know that they're all like that but it would be fun not to have to repaste the damn cpu when you get it!). Get a good cooling pad and try to undervolt cpu and other little tweeting and you ready to go(gpu overclock)!,0
"(so far so good, this thing surfs the web fast): so far so good, this thing surfs the web fast, finds devices fast and is really just a solid little computer if your looking for something just to add a few photos or surf the web. this thing is pretty legit in that fasion its not good for gaming but for the average student and normal person who just needs web,doc, and spreadsheet access is a great buy.",0
"(Great laptop, Terrible buying experience): Laptop runs great, has handled everything I've thrown at it flawlessly. Runs most of my games on medium at 200+ frames, NEVER had a game play under 80 frames unless i intentionally set the framers lower for environmental heat reasons (I play outside allot and it's hot lately). My only complaint it with Amazon, my 3 day order turned into 5 days, then 7 days, then 2 weeks, and still arrived on day 15, not 2 weeks. It was not an isolated incident either, I ordered the 17 inch model for my father a few days later and received the same run around for 2 more weeks. I am a patient guy but I drive trucks for a living, I can't just sit waiting for packages for a month when I was told when ordering the would arrive within a week.",0
(Great laptops): Buy this laptop as gifts to my in-law,0
"(DO NOT BUY. More than one laptop ordered has had defects.): Had several problems with the quality of speakers on this laptop - the computer was defective. Returned for a refund, but they charged us a hefty restocking fee. When we contacted them about the restocking fee, we were told that they would refund it. They have never refunded the fee. Do not recommend purchasing this laptop.Edit: ANOTHER one of these laptops we ordered is having a defective problem. This time with the laptop not detecting it's own camera, and the USB ports just stopped working after only having this laptop for 3 months. Now I'm going to have to go through a fight to get this one refunded along with the restocking fee that they'll try to charge me. DO NOT BUY.",0
(Perfect!): Perfect! Now I can get my business going!,0
"(No assistance from HP): I tired to connect to external monitors. I first bought a docking station for the USB-C port that the PC has and that did not work. The USB-C port is only good for data transfer. I then bought a splitter for the one HDMI port on the laptop. This allowed me to connect one screen but only mirrored the second screen. When calling HP help support, they redirected me to a third party phone number of which they told me i had to pay in order to get their assistance. For anything but absolutely minor issues, HP will make you pay just to get answers on a product that you bought from them.",0
(Don’t buy): Ass,0
(Good gaming laptop for the price): My son loves it and it has well balanced specs from AMD 8 cores and 16 GB RAM and good IPS with bright above 300 nits bright screen. Reasonable price and solid the case. Nothing to complain about. Price is good compare to others,0
"(Great quality and form factor): It is a beautiful machine the runs a lot for a long time.e without getting too hot (as many other machines do). Great touchscreen in a lightweight, very slim form factor to support tablet like use. The downside is that their chat based support is slow and can't look outside the box when troubleshooting (in my case a bad speaker driver). I'd love to see a machine of this caliber running the MAC O/S. It should come with a pen.",0
(Slow n memory issues): Area around keyboard smears easy. Having memory problems already as previous reviews started. Was fast now slow.,0
(Mid Budget Gaming Laptop): Definitely a mid budget gaming laptop. The battery life is not great. But a good processor and 165hz for about $1000 is a good deal!,0
(Good Stuff): The complete lack of information is my only complaint. The hardware is all that I could hope for,0
"(Great.... However....): How unfortunate. Did not suit my needs at all. I purchased this Chromebook to use primarily for remote desktop software. I didn't have audio when working in music production applications. I have never had that issue before with other Chromebooks. I couldn't even get sound in Google Play Music remotely (just did that to test the machine), or any other mp3 player for that matter. The Chromebook also kept restarting and was sluggish. I had high hopes, but Acer is now on my ""do not buy"" list.",0
(Become a Chromeo too.): I am now a Chromeo this OS integrates seamlessly with my smartphone it has made my PC a large paperweight.,0
"(Bang for your buck): Been looking for a decent mid to higher tier option for gaming on the go since my living situation is temporary for the time being. I haven't had any issues running any game on high or max settings and the SSD is more then enough to make a huge difference in terms of load times and speed. Going from an old rustbucket frankenstein of a desktop that barely worked, this is worth every penny. There are of course pros and cons with this like anything else.Pros+Exceptionally fast, especially for a laptop+Fairly lightweight+Dragon Center is pretty good for controlling the fans+Can play pretty much anything on high or max settings+VR Ready!+Very slick and stylish designCons-552 SSD really sucks and can be a deal breaker for some-Can get really hot if you run it over a period of a number of hours which is why theres settings for the fans-When it has to cool down the fans get super loud, not an issue for me because I have headphones but some mics will pick up the fans-Very few usb slots, I remedied this with a hub I already had thankfully-Keyboard takes a bit to get used toOverall if you're looking for a pretty good laptop for the price, I highly recommend this. Of course getting a gaming desktop whether prebuilt or you build your own is definitely the better option in the long run but this is good for folks like me that don't have a permanent residence yet.",0
"(Randomlyl Restarts): Purchased this laptop in Mar 2020 and in the first 2 months of warranty it randomly would restart about once a week. Then over time it started randomly starting with no error message and when calling into customer support they have not resolved the issue even with the new Windows updates and running diagnostics tools and whatever else and ensuring all firm ware was updated. This is a headache to deal with and now it restarts randomly without notice usually in the afternoon between 2 and 4 pm. I have about 10 google chrome tabs only one of which is YouTube and will have Microsoft Word sometimes (even when not it restarts), along with some desktop applications which are low on the processor. Now i'm out $1600 with a defective product that interrupts work flow in the middle of the day. THis is a known issue as over 150 have complained about this and it's suspected that it has something to due with the Ryzen processor as some have exchanged it for one with an Intel processor. BEWARE and get the Intel processor even if it's a little more.",0
"(Great little device, excellent battery life, great for school/uni): bought this Chromebook for university. works great, speedy; hardly ever slows down even when multiple tabs open and streaming video.very portable and excellent build quality.the pen works great, with very little input delay when writing. (m3 version)When not using the pen, tablet mode can be a little unresponsive, I wouldn't suggest buying this device to replace an iPad or tablet.the screen is bright and colourfull.overall great little laptop, perfect for studying or secondary device. chrome os is excellent and speedy.(this model has no backlit keyboard)",0
"(it works): My wife is a PC person, not Mac, so I purchased this for her for Christmas, so far so good.",0
(Good): Great value,0
(Fast start ups): I love my laptop. Only thing i’d Change is having a number pad on the side.,0
"(Great product. But the product instructions manual has misleading information caused a lot of trouble.): Update after the replacement:I've received the replacement. It was same as the previous one. So I've realized that something is wrong. After thorough research on the internet, it turns out that so called ""soundbar"" was just the secondary heat grille. The misleading information on the instructions manual caused me a lot of trouble below. Also customer supports should have known these things before throwing ""reinstall, reset"" words out of their mouths.The laptop itself is a beautiful, powerful. I've faced no issues playing PUBG at High settings. When it is in stress, the fan sound is loud. But it is expected from high performance gaming laptop. It is not noticeable when you wear headphones.As for the low speaker volume issue, I think any new speakers with or without subwoofer out there will do the job.Finally, I am updating my 1 star to 4 stars despite having troubles I went through. Because I like this laptop.----Original review:When I received this item, I didn't pay much attention to the sound as I was able to hear Cortana's voice. I've moved all my data from my old laptop to this new laptop. And cleaned my old laptop before I sending it to my sibling.Then I've noticed that sound is not so great on this one. So I've tried to change the volume up. However, even it is at 100%, it was no way near loud compared to my old dell laptop. After some inspection, I've found out that main soundbar in the middle is not producing sound, only side small speakers were working all these time.Contacted with product Supports, they have suggested me to reinstall the sound driver Or reset the laptop. I've tried them both. Reinstalled the sound driver, but it was same. Then I've decided to reset the laptop. At this point, I had to cancel the shipment of my old laptop in order to move my data back before resetting this one completely (I could have reset only the windows. But I had a feeling that resetting will also be the same. So I've decided moved my data back to prepare it for replacement). After complete reset, it didn't help as well.All these time consuming extra works and frustration are the reason for 1 star.I've requested replacement. After I inspect the replacement, I will think of updating my stars.",0
"(Worth Every Penny.): This laptop is by far the best bang for the buck. A fair priced laptop for good specs you're getting a full on RTX 2070 with an Intel I7. The build quality is very good, the stylish and colorful RGB keyboard is an eyecather. So far I've used this laptop to play FFXIV on maximum settings and had no problems. This laptop has fast response time. Overall I would recommend this laptop over a Razer based on performance. My only gripes I have with this laptop are the speakers are mediocre, but a headset solves the problem. Secondly this laptops battery life is average as it consumes power like crazy.",0
"(Wifi doesn't work.): WiFi stopped working after a week, likely due to a faulty WiFi card. There are many reviews on internet with the same problem.",0
"(Good for light use): This laptop is used for getting on the internet,and light computer use. No gaming or business use. It works well for these purposes",0
"(Fast prossessing speeds, lightweight): This laptop has pretty much everything I was looking for. It boots up very quickly, processes quickly, and it lightweight. The battery life is pretty great. My only issue is with the touchpad. It can be sensitive and aggravating sometimes, probably because the left and right-click buttons are part of the touchpad.",0
(Awesome!👍😊): Business and work!👍,0
(Just don't like this): I don't like at all anymore!!,0
"(Fries above 95 with very very light loads and heavy external cooling): I cannot believe how disappointed I am after reading the reviews on this product and thinking it was even close to functional. I have a high-end cooling pad and multiple room fans assisting the ventilation, but the CPU still exceeds 95C within 30 seconds of just opening the main menu of a mid-range game on the lowest possible settings it offers. ASUS has no solution and is advising me to return it because the price is absolutely not worth it if my motherboard is going to be fried within 3 years.",0
(Esta muy bien): Más colores y más en Capacidad y más en RAM y vplumen,0
(VERY FUNCTIONAL): OVERALL IT'S VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY- THE KEYPAD IS VERY FUNCTIONAL.,0
"(4 times the screen size of the laptop): Love this monitor, got it as a second display for my work laptop. Love the extra screen space!",0
(Good): I found big cosmetic but nice work.,0
(Perfect): Perfect for my kids school work,0
"(No tiene Garantia): Un fraude no tiene garantia de ningún tipo Al encenderla me arroja un mensaje diciendo que no tiene disco duro y tan bien vino golpeada en la tata superior externa y en el botón de encendido, escribi a soporte de amazon y no me dio solución a mi reclamo esta compra fue un fraude no la compren no dan garantia",0
"(Five Stars): Awesome performance, I really loved this laptop.",0
"(Crisp gaming): Great gaming laptop for the price. I mainly play Warzone, and the graphics are so crisp my buddy is jealous. There are only a couple downsides in my opinion. Battery dies after one game match, but I don't mind keeping it plugged in when I play. Hard drive space is definitely lacking, but I'm just going to get a an external hard drive to alleviate that. Overall the issues that I think it has are easily maneuvered around and it's worth the price.",0
(Hardware is solid): So when I received the computer I got started downloading everything playing some games and stuff. I noticed the screen acting weird and next day the screen is going in and out of working. It took 2 days for my screen to not work. The hardware in this laptop is great. But the quality of the build is why the price is good for this laptop. Screen is really flimsy and if you want to carry this in my backpack. I wouldn’t do it because it’s gonna flex. I ended up returning this because I just don’t want to deal with this issue at all in the future.,0
"(Excellent Portable and Excellent International Shipping): This new ASUS model was just what I wanted, a 4-core i7, 16GB of RAM, 4GB of graphics, 256GB of SSD and 1TB of HDD, as well as its connections 3.0 and 3.1 Type C.It is very thin and very light, with an incredible touch, and built in golden, brutal aluminum.The screen is of very good quality, although you will always have to have 100% brightness.Its keyboard is very pleasant to the touch and also its backlighting is adjustable.The S.O is installed as standard on the SSD, in my case, it starts in 12 seconds.Nothing overheats, its ventilation system is excellent, and almost the best of all is its audio system, which is from the same manufacturer that collaborates with BMW, ""Harman / Kardon"", they have a brutal clarity and a very powerful sound.I ordered the laptop from Spain with the express delivery, and despite having been importing, I have not had any problem with the customs, everything has been very easy and in a very short time.Who buy it from Spain, who knows that it does not have the letter ""ñ"", but there are ways to use it, I would recommend putting it as a Spanish language, and as a keyboard the ""international American"" to use the keyboard correctly and to the Time to write allows you to put the accents correctly.In short, it has been a great purchase, very happy, and for a much lower price than in Spain, where the same model would come for € 1700-1900 ($ 1,900-2,100), and thanks to the imported order, the total cost including The customs fees to Spain has been € 1170 ($ 1330).",0
(Perfect!!): I have been wanting my own laptop for a while. This one is perfect size and I love the color white!!,0
"(Good Value for Multipurpose Laptop): My family needed a multi-purpose laptop and Acer's Nitro 5 fits the bill. It's design is sleek (although it is fairly big) and it looks really nice with the red backlit keyboard. Although, I find a backlit keyboard is an unnecessary battery drain. It's simple to toggle the keyboard light off and on. The screen resolution is great for our needs. I've been doing telework since Covid-19 and I don't need tons of bells and whistles, just something reliable and safe. Norton Antivirus is included on the Nitro 5. It is easily upgradeable if you need more memory. Battery life is good (especially if you turn off the back light).My children need a computer for home-schoolwork and the Nitro 5 fits the bill for them as well. I realize this is marketed as a gaming laptop, and we may or may not use it for gaming. It's a good beginner gamer laptop and at this price point, it has been a good value for us. It only needed a Microsoft account to activate and use and it was ready to go right away.",0
(Much better in real life than pictures): Es hermosa! Compacta y el dise?o es elegante!,0
"(Nice laptop, but also poor quality): This laptop worked great for the whole first month I had it, until the wireless card stopped working (can't connect to any WiFi) After troubleshooting with Asus customer service, I have to send in my laptop for repair. Really disappointed that I had to have this experience with my expensive 1-month old laptop.",0
"(Best gaming laptop with fair price): This laptop is really great for everyday regular gamer. It may not be the top of the line but it also doesn't cost you to go broke to buy one. For its price of 1k, it's very fair and offers ton of value. GPU is more than adequate to handle most games. I play Fallout 4 on high graphics and it runs very smooth. It can run RDR 2, GTA, Farcry etc. The Ryzen processor is really powerful and I think it beats intel from analysis video I saw on YouTube. Overall, really great laptop. I don't go hardcore on all the advanced technicalities like overclocking, etc. Just simple gamer who likes good graphics. I recommend Legion 100%",0
"(Decent): Bought for my husband after his other asus only lasted 18mths. I was skeptical to say the least, but this was what he wanted. Aside from the volume being horrible, it appears to be working just fine. We’re only 2mths into it so I’m still very cautious.",0
(extremely slow): Slowest processing time I have ever purchased with a laptop. You could go to sleep watching the circular arrow go round and round and round.,0
(This will not work with regular printers): Has to be all cloud based printing and is a MAJOR HASSLE. I never did get it to work.,0
(It works right out of the box): Gift to a relative for school,0
(Overall a good laptop): Got this for my 17 yr old son and he loves it he uses it just for online gaming definitely recommend for a first time gaming laptop,0
(Great for the price): This laptop is lightweight and easy to take on the go. I needed a new laptop for work and this one is perfect. It's affordable and surprisingly good. I've never had a Chromebook but I kinda like it. What I don't like is they keyboard. It's smaller and more condensed than others which makes it a little harder to type on. Not everything is at the same place as I'm used to. There's big speakers on either side of the keyboard that could have been put somewhere else to make room for the keys. But that's my only qualm. I would recommend this laptop.,0
"(Solid performance): My MSI Leopard GL 65 arrived yesterday and I couldn't be happier. All I can really say is it runs everything in my steam library really well, the screen is very sharp and bright and it has an excellent keyboard and trackpad. The computer feels really solid and well built and I think its going to last me a very long time. I did notice that the computer can get hot while gaming so you might not want to play with it in your lap.",0
(Best performance to price!!!): At 1500 This is the best gaming laptop out right now in terms of specs. It can get alittle hot but thats pretty much the case with all gaming laptops. ALSO 3 hours of battery life is a bummer but i usually keep mine connected to the outlet anyway so no big deal for me!!! runs every game that i throw at it easily!! highly recommended !!,0
"(Not too much, not too little, but just right): As many before me have said, this is a terrific computer. I returned two computers with a faster processor and more RAM. They simply ran too hot and had fans come on quickly. This Asus has a very good processor and sufficient RAM, but it runs quietly with a solid battery life. It boots in less than 5 seconds for me, and it's speed isn't affected much by my VPN service and other processor chokers.Asus gives you some nice benefits, like the Audio Wizard 10 band equalizer. The backlit keys go off after a bit to conserve power. For the money, just an awesome product.",0
(Good product good price): I wish it was touch screen.,0
"(great purchase): I really like this laptop. It boots up really quickly and is super light. The battery life is great, but not as long as they claim (up to 12 hours). I think I've gotten around 8, though. Long enough that I don't have to worry about bringing my charger with me to school.Minor annoyances: you have to push the function key in order to use 'home,' 'end,' 'pg up,' 'pg dn,' and the volume keys. I was able to download a program to remap my volume keys, but it would have been nice to have a Fn lock/unlock option or something.",0
I seem to get about 2 hours' worth of use doing really basic lightweight work with the battery saver on.,0

"(Nice laptop. Way better than the Macbook Pro.): This is a great little computer. I use it daily for working in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Premier. It will also run Left For Dead 2 really well but not GTA V or Far Cry 5. The graphics are killer and the touchscreen rules. I like my Microsoft Surface pen better than the Asus pen so I use it instead; no problem.",0

(Garbage): This is my second chrome book and the 4 year old one is better than this one. Constantly drops WiFi making it useless. Really disappointing.,0
"(replacement for the 2015 model.): Bought this for my 84 year old mother. I bought her one in 2015 she loved it. It got a lot of use by a lot of people. Im sure it just needs a new battery and the bottom battery port. The bottom is because a family member messed with it and cracked it not acer's issue. but, because it is a 2015 there are not a lot of parts for me to fix it and she really missed surfing the web.. which is what chromebooks are great for! The battery life lasted 4 days before she had to recharge. She wasn't on it a lot this week. But the battery is a lot longer lasting than the 2015. it is wonderful for her to do what she does, goes on facebook, pay bills, and clicks on stuff that would give a normal laptop a virus! but, since Chromebooks run everything through a sandbox , they don't get viruses. I have the c720 from 5 years ago and im using it to put up this review. they update regularly and quickly by time you restart it has updated. Everything you used to do on Windows , Chrome has google docs and other programs for that. i do not miss windows one bit. Great machine at a great price! love Acer's Google Chromebooks.",0

"(A decent laptop for the price <But inefficient for gaming>): Where to begin with the ROG Strix GL703VM Scar Edition?It is feature rich and the components are solid:i7-7700HQ Quad Core Laptop @2.8GHz16 GB of RAMNVidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB)256 GB SSD (Mine happens to be a Hynix)1TB 7200RPM Hard Drive17.3"" 1080p 120Hz monitorNow the paper specs are great and the laptop is much thinner than previous generations (I personally went from a G750JM). It runs all number of applications flawlessly and is a bit more than a laptop for general, everyday, use.The only con that I have on this model is that it runs warm, even in idle actions. The keyboard will absorb some of this heat, so during use, you can certainly feel a quadrant of keys that are more warm than others. It isn't a major issue and can certainly still run phenomenally.(Edit: After much trouble, I will return this because the device gets a bit too warm. Using on a table, the laptop under load will reach 80C, which would be fine, if it didn't cause the keyboard to stop functioning or the whole laptop to reboot. For a gaming laptop to be unable to play for an hour without it crashing in FF14 on Laptop settings is a bit concerning.)",0
(Description of item is misleading.): Description said laptop had a touchscreen. It does NOT!!!😡😡😡,0
"(Snappy, bright, energy-efficient... no Mag-Safe): This MBA is fan-TAS-tic to use. It can run unplugged all day. The speaker is sufficiently loud, and the hi-rez screen is eye-popping.But using a Mac laptop's USB-C port for power, after more than a decade of Mag-Safe bliss, is darn-near CRIMINAL. Thankfully, we still have capitalism, and there are a number of 3rd-party workaround devices that mimic Mag-Safe to a greater-or-lesser degree. Sigh.",0
(Don’t waste your money): Sucks for sound and the pictures not screen isn’t that great.,0
"(Trouble recognizing wireless networks!): This laptop has been extremely frustrating. Boy do I regret buying it. I wouldn't recommend buying it. Don't get me wrong. It's aesthetically pleasing, light and all. But this is no good if the laptop doesn't serve your primary reason for buying it - to access wireless connections. Mine is a CORE i5 8th gen. It doesn't recognize wireless connections. However if I hotspot with my phone, it immediately picks up the hotspot connection. A quick check on google for similar problems indicates that this is a persistent problem with ASUS. I have done various things recommended to troubleshoot such as disabling and enabling the network drivers, uninstalling and installing them too. Occasionally this works, but mostly it doesn't - like today. Even when it does, I have to make several attempts of disabling and uninstalling the network drivers. It's got to a point where I don't bother using it. I bought it in February 2019 and have used it less than 10 times If anyone has any additional tips of what I can do to resolve this issue, I'd love to hear. At this point, I'll try anything!",0
(Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop): Buena relación costo beneficio,0
It's very light,0
"(Best battery life ever): I purchased this computer because it was cheap. My goal was to install and learn Linux with it. The thing that has impressed me the most is the battery life. I have used it for ten to twelve hours a day for the last week and I only have to plug it in while I am sleeping. It also performs all of the basic functions of a much higher priced computer flawlessly. I surf the internet, watch videos, check email, and make presentations without complaint. The size and weight of this computer also make it very convenient to take everywhere. The biggest limitation with this computer is the hard drive size (32GB) which I work around by storing all media files and documents on a micro SD card. This is a good computer.",0
"(Light weight, nice screen, fast.): Bought it for working at home due to the pandemic. Very good computer only wish it had lighted keyboard.",0
"(Better than expected!): I can't complain. Its design, weight, size make it a formidable combination",0
"(Regret): I'm not impressed with this machine, especially at the price it's listed. I paid far less than this for my HP Spectre and it's a higher quality machine. Functionally everything works but it's like comparing a Lamborghini to a Datsun. Both ""work"" but which would you rather use? The bezel and body on my HP are far superior. They are prettier and feel better to use. This Dell doesn't feel much different than my acer chromebook. It doesn't perform any better than the chromebook either.Overall it works but doesn't convey any features to me that deserve the price and that's important to me. I dislike unnecessarily overpriced products.",0

"(Runs games amazingly): I am very glad that I decided to buy this computer, it runs games like forza and cod amazingly and looks incredible! The design is simple and sleek and the computer runs very quickly. I have been using it for games and videos/streams and the quality and quickness it has is immeasurable to what I've had before. The setup was pretty easy because it guides you through the whole thing. I will absolutely be sticking with the lenovo legion laptops and buying again or upgrading when I need to.",0
"(Buena calidad precio): Se adquirió en uno de los momentos más fuertes de pandemia, por el precio y características es lo mejor que pude encontrar, ya que los componentes de PC estaban por los cielos, como diría que a considerar es que no tiene ? y bueno el acabado del teclado que un poco abajo de lo que uno podría esperar pero totalmente funcional tama?o y buena imagen en pantalla",0
"(Amazing Value and Performance): Absolutely love it so far. The thing runs like a dream. Aside from startup which seems a bit slower than a much older model but perhaps that has to do with the power levels we are working with here. Startup still only takes less than 30-40 seconds however my old gl62m 7rdx would start up in about 14 seconds from full boot.Performance: I have only run Apex and Valorant on this thing so far as to test the graphics, but both run great. Apex on full graphic settings feels buttery smooth and the 144hz monitor has made moving and turning in Valorant feel amazing compared to the old 60hz I have been used to. I am excited to test this out also on RS6 Siege, Total War Three Kingdoms, Black Ops, and CSGO. And it seems to dissipate heat MUCH better than my older model gl62m aswell. I would see averages inside the 90s 95-98 sometimes on my old one. I haven't seen this go over 75-80 degrees so far whilst playing. Just did some undervolting as well to see if that keeps it even cooler!As far as workstation performance is concerned running Ableton on this machine also feels amazing, and my interface was running great even at very low buffer rates.Design: Beautiful feeling and looking keyboard. The keys feel solid. The lighting has different modes, though the solid color available from the Steelseries engine doesn't look as great as the different flowing gradient options. The screen is nice and bright. The size is great and it doesn't actually feel very heavy and is very easy to take with you to a different room, on the go, etc.Overall: Love this thing. For the price I don't think you could beat it, even building your own PC with these specs would come close to the 1400$ I spent to get it all in a laptop! Love it, thanks MSI for this great deal.",0

"(Best Price to Performance + Portability and Battery Life + Design Quality Engineering There Is to the Best of My Knowledge): People whine about thermal throttling and coil whine, no pun intended! ;) But seriously, I bought this used like-new condition from Amazon warehouse which was most likely a return and CDI showed only a couple hours on the SSD. I love this laptop and have had it for about a month now. I hardly ever write product reviews, but it seems like there are a lot of complaints about this laptop and it doesn't get the credit it deserves. For these specs while maintaining slim and light profile good luck finding a better deal. I did pay $1400 plus tax which is slightly lower than the current price but I challenge others to comment on laptops with similar specs and design quality to compare this to. The Dell XPS 15 is in the archetype but lacks the specs unless you want to pay $2000. And sure, it has a 4k display, but at the cost of earlier GPU model, on a 15"" with the pixel density, 4k is just marketing unless you need 4k for visual design projects there is not much point, you have to render 4k and then increase zoom anyway. There are some drawbacks though and 1. I am not super impressed with the keyboard. It performs fine and no problems with ghosting, but when I'm really hammering away at the keys like I'm used to doing on my desktop pc, there is a slight rattle, but that's just me being too rough on the keyboard due to my fast and high-actuation force typing habits. The next issue is that I really liked the silver design of the UX430UN, and I wish they would have incorporated that design into this build rather than the black spun metal which is very attractive and has class, but also attracts fingerprints. So have an anti-static microfiber cloth and screen/keyboard cleaner handy (which you should when you own a touchscreen laptop anyway), but it's not as bad as I might make it sound. It's not a fingerprint magnet, it's just that the silver spun metal design didn't show any fingerprints, greasy or clean barely. Lastly, sure, there is some thermal throttling if you are playing graphic intensive games, but I can play Destiny 2 on Medium settings with a few things tweaked at 60FPS no problem. It will start to slow down as it heats up a little bit, but a Havik cooling pad eliminates that problem. Keep in mind this is not a gaming-designed laptop although it plays most games very well. The thermal engineering was done well and the keyboard never gets hot, only the back and only when you're running the GPU at full load for an extended period. Any other case it runs cool, setting it on your lap and browsing, editing office files, watching videos, it will stay nice and cool for around 10-11 hours of basic mixed use.",0

"(Great gaming experience if you're tied to the wall): The performance on this thing is great. The hardware in it is really good for a laptop. A 6 core modern generation processor with an RTX 2070 in this price range is huge. I really enjoy this laptop with the exception of a few small drawbacks. Let it be known that before even powering this laptop on, I swapped the RAM for 2x16gb for 32gb total, and added a 2nd SSD(2.5"" format)A point that I can't hold against this laptop as it is not advertised, but would have been nice is that there is support for a 2nd m.2 slot, but they did not include the header on the board. Why? That is beyond me, but it would have been nice to have instead of adding another 2.5""The things that really hold this laptop back, in order of mild annoyance to major detractor, are the following.The speakers. I'm not the only one mentioning this point. While the sound is ""okay"", the volume is not. Even at max volume, I can barely hear the thing. I don't have great hearing, but come on.The screen. While it looks pretty good and the 144Hz is great, the brightness is just not good. I understand that being a laptop, having a bright screen will drain a battery quickly, but sometimes you need it. The brightest setting on this machine should really be where median value is. I haven't even played any games that depend on brightness, but even in rocketleague, on most maps it is miserable.The dagger really is the battery. Not even gaming, I have to be in power save mode to maybe get two full hours. If I'm gaming...forget about it. An hour if I'm lucky. This is the price you pay for having such power hungry components while trying to have decent audio and brightness, but this is somehow even worse than I'd expect. If you plan to do anything intensive with this laptop, stay near an outlet.For the price I paid I'm mostly satisfied, but mostly because I value hardware performance above all else.",0

"(A Suitable Replacement for my Alienware): First, I'll just tell you that, yes, this computer is incredibly awesome. Then I'm going to nitpick it as much as I can just to give you an honest perspective and hopefully some details you haven't already figured out.My last primary home laptop was an Alienware 17. It came out after Windows 8, but it ran 7 because everyone still hated 8. I knew it was getting old, but I didn't want to give up that super-high-quality feel. That computer was really large and substantial, which was both a fault and gave it a luxurious feel that I thought couldn't be reproduced. ...a long time ago, I had no real opinion of Asus, but then my Dad actually got a ROG at some point and I was sort of amazed that this brand that I would have almost considered generic at the time put out such a fine piece of hardware. So when I had a chance to get this computer, I knew it was good enough to replace the Alienware. And it is, absolutely. This computer is about half the weight and much smaller, but it still feels substantial and ""super premium"". This does have a compressed keyboard (the Alienware actually was wide enough to have a separate number pad), but it's spread out enough as to not be cramped or annoying. And thank God the Delete key is in an intuitive place! (I find that a problem with many laptops). As always, a new touchpad takes some getting used to, but I have it configured how I want it now, and I even finally gave in and started doing two-finger scrolling...I need to get these gripes out of the way, although they apply to almost all pre-built computers: Too much crapware and ads that won't let you alone at first (RE: McAfee), but not nearly as much as a lot of cheap computers. I hate that Microsoft won't even let you use your own hardware without getting you to make an account for their stupid software. I'm not sure you could even start using this computer if you don't have an active Internet connection (or they're making it harder and harder to find a workaround, but I'm getting too bored and jaded to bother fighting it anymore). Windows 11 at least seems to work well and look good, but they still have some super annoying features from trying to be too much like Apple. I just can't stand that we have some settings under Settings and others under Control Panel. I hate the Apple feel of Settings, but to have to use both is just stupid. Then you can't ungroup icons in the taskbar and I hate the button to turn off Wifi because it's too easy to hit. This is not a phone! OK...point is, I wish MS would respect its customers the way they used to.On to more specific nitpicks:1) Once in a while, I still turn on the number pad on the touchpad accidentally. This is a super cool feature, but I'm not sure if I'll ever get used to using it for typing in phone numbers and stuff like that. The overhead on having to tap and hold the corner first if a bit much, and then it's easy to forget to turn off. Of course, if you're doing spreadsheets, you'll probably be thrilled to have that on a midsize laptop.2) As usual, the included control center software, ""Armoury Crate"", is quirky in how it works with Windows. As with my previous Alienware, it's now only the second computer I have left such software installed and allowed to run (not sure you could get all the lights working otherwise), but it takes some fidgeting to get used to, and I had some issues with WiFi not coming back on and stuff that I attribute to this. At some point, you just have to give Windows back control of the power settings. Once I got it all working in harmony (basically just using ""Armoury Crate"" for the lights) it's doing fine. I'm still not convinced about leaving the other Asus software on there - it keeps bothering me about updating, but it seems redundant not only to Windows, but to Armoury Crate as well.3) The Screen doesn't tilt back quite as much as I'd like it to. I'm glad it seems to have a sturdy mechanism to hold it in place, but I could use just a few more degrees on a day like today: Sitting in a super comfortable chair with my leg crossed at 90 degrees, back of the laptop on the leg. I can still use it fine, but a few more degrees would be ideal.4) Another common problem: I wish they'd put twin power ports on the back and side of the device so you could pick which one you wanted to use. The battery is great, so I'm not using power now, but power out the back doesn't work with the position I'm sitting in described above. Also, I put it back on a small table near the couch when not in use, but it's slightly annoying to plug and unplug. Much of that has to do with the fact that there is a ""goiter"" (I think it's used to cancel out capacitance, but I'm not sure) on the power cord right near the barrel jack. This is just in the way and gets caught on the back of the table.BTW, the power brick is huge, which doesn't surprise me, but I absolutely love that you can plug in with power delivery, which means you can use this with a proper USB-C docking station. I guess you'll still want the power brick for hardcore gaming, but I love the option.5) No USB ports on the right side. Not a big deal, but sometimes you want the option depending where you are or how you're sitting. They use the space for some add-on thing they want to sell you instead...6) I get sick of trying to keep up with WiFi, but I actually just got a WiFi 6E AP, and it's awesome to be able to use it. I think they really did get rid of some latency there. It's pretty awesome when things get noticeably better. And I haven't even gotten the AP working optimally yet...Also 2.5Gb LAN port. I don't have a 2.5Gb capable switch yet, but I'll have to work on that because my AP has a port for that as well...7) I know everyone wants to hear about game performance: I haven't been able to bog this thing down with anything. I can play 2020s era games and have it transcoding for Plex in the background, and it barely spins up the fans. I mean, I can't give you anything but anecdotal evidence, so I'll leave that to professional electronics reviewers, but I'll just tell you it is as awesome as they say. At this point in time, I don't think there's anything this can't handle (at least that you'd likely be doing at home). And, just as importantly, it really is quiet and doesn't seem to run exceptionally hot, either. My last laptop could get so annoyingly loud.8) Battery. I was surprised to see the battery's Ah rating was barely higher than my previous computer, but then even more surprised how much better the power must be managed, because it'll more or less last all day if I'm just doing work-work (like spreadsheets and boring stuff) and web browsing. So it has the feel of a great all around, everyday type of computer (and you can even turn the lights off if you want to be low key), but then you can instantly turn it into a real powerhouse. You can have a profile for use with a docking station for work, one to maximize battery life for leisurely web browsing around the house, and one for use with the power brick as a gaming rig. Versatility is fantastic.9) I had some weird quirks early on, and called customer service. One thing was the WiFi I was talking about earlier and one was the screen doing weird stuff. I partly called customer service just because I wanted it on file that I was having issues in case I did need a repair. Normally I wouldn't just because I normally know better than they do... But I got a real person quickly and he gave me non-condescending advice and made a file for me. I just had to do some random driver updates and it seemed to work. Now, I don't think things should ship needing updates, but...at least they have real customer service.Well, I could probably pontificate for 10 times this long, but the conclusion is that after the minor pains of changing computers and getting used to some slight hardware differences, getting past the frustration of Microsoft and a few typical antivirus program ads, doing little tweaks to get the touchpad working for me instead of against me, and screwing around with updates until my problems went away, I am 100% happy with the computer. Not just happy, but thrilled. This is the kind of hardware that once you experience as your own, you really can't go back. This not only has all the computing power and features you could want, but it's also cool in every way.",0
(Battery life): Quality of item was state-of-the-art. Delivery was exceptional. Elegant packaging. Seller is first-rate and choice.,0
The large glass trackpad is a joy to use.,0
(Amazing): best laptop i have bought i recommend this great gaming computer i actually bought 2 of these one for me and my son love this computer,0
(Good for the price): Good for the money! Obviously better options out there if you spend more but good overall good quality for price.,0
"(Need a code to work): I believe this product would have served my purpose had I had a cell phone to receive the verification code. Not having one I tried the other suggested methods they said, and it didn't recognize my email or home phone . Hence without a cell phone don't buy this product. Being a senior on a budget I don't like having to purchase something in order to use something else.",0
"(One year in with last year's model - this thing runs like a champ.): I have one model earlier than this laptop, and it has been almost exactly 1 year since I bought it. I bought this laptop because I needed something cheap that I could use for 3D work on the go, take into meetings, etc.This is a really fantastic laptop if you want a good price for great performance. In its unused time, I have been running it 24/7 constantly calculating BOINC calculations for the SETI massive parallel computation project. This is a killer calculation that is very hard on computers, maxing out both the CPU and the GPU simultaneously. My Macbook air overheated and totally died after just a few months running like this. Two of my desktops also choked on it. This laptop, though, gets really hot, but just keeps on going!Performance wise, it has been great for just about every game I have played on it. It's pretty close to desktop level performance. I also was running the Oculus Rift with it (on a GTX 1060 card) without issue, so the newer model with even upgraded specifications should be great for such tasks.Reliability wise, it's just kept on going. It has be very dependable.It's a larger laptop, so maybe not for everyone. It gets hot in use, and it is really hungry for power with a quite short battery life. It's enough to get through a meeting, but if I'm the presenter I will always bring my power brick.I cannot speak for their tech support / service, as I never had the need, which I guess is good.We bought several others for folks at my work, and they have all been running great as well, as far as I know.Bottom line: This is a great ""lots of power for the money"" laptop that has been super reliable for me, and I would recommend it to anyone with similar needs to me, but not if all you need a super lightweight long battery life unit for just email and facebook.",0
"(Very good but is quite buggy): It’s overall pretty good but when i just got it there’s lots of random bugs like the keyboard backlight is on but my screen is not functioning but after like 10 min it’s fine and when i charges it wont charge and then i realize u have to customize it, overall aurous’ system is very weird to use but the laptop overall is good",0
(works as intended!): works as intended!,0
(amazing for the price): this is an amazing laptop for the price I got it at and it's up to date I love my new laptop,0
"(Powerful laptop with upgradable ram and SSD): Worth every penny. Recently started streaming with a couple of friends, and this laptop blows away all of their tower set ups. The thermals are fantastic, and the graphics are amazing. I’ve been able to play every single game I’ve come across on the highest settings. The monitor resolution is a little low compared to some, but honestly if you wanna 4K monitor you can always hook it up. That’s what I plan on doing for video editing. I’m getting ready to upgrade the SSD in the Ram as well. Best laptop I’ve ever owned hands-down .",0
"(excelente condicion del producto, funcionamiento perfecto): excellent product, arrived in very good condition, I only had to update the hardware and software, its condition is 9 out of 10 its operation is perfect, I am very happy with the product",0

(Better lap top for better price): Very good product! I am happy until now.,0
"(Great for gaming, Powerful laptop): I use this laptop for gaming and for ArcMap software and it definitely works! The graphics are great, the battery life lasts for about 6 to 7 hours I think which I'm fine with. I am definitely buying this laptop again or another ACER laptop in the future. I now trust Acer!",0
The laptop keeps very cool even when overclocking cpu and gpu.,0
"(Decent quality, poor video connector design.): 2018 Lenovo 330 17.3"" laptop has a good solid feel. It was issued to an employee. Shortly after the warranty expiration period passed, the backlight on the screen stopped working. Upon dismantling the laptop I clearly saw the issue - the video display connector also housed the backlight power on the right-side of the ribbon cable (when facing the laptop from the side of the keyboard). The motherboard showed clear signs of electrical damage to this section of the ribbon and the connector was only partially intact. The side where the backlight power ran had burned itself completely off. Had I know of this quality limitation, I may have opened the machine up and taken steps to isolate the power (adding dielectric to the connector, or running simple bypass power lines for example). Honestly, I am surprised and dismayed that Lenovo cut corners on such a simple thing. Most laptops have a separate power connector - utilizing wire with a gauge suited to the application. The paper-thin ribbon and micro connector proved to be too small to handle the power current used by the display. I would not recommend this product to anyone.",0
"(Died after 3 months): Product was fine, Chrome OS works well on simple tasks. Surprisingly, it died after 3 months of use. It was only used indoors.",0
"(Black screen of death, weak battery life): Like another reviewer, I got a black screen after about 3 weeks of light use. Amazon tech support was wholly unhelpful, and reaching Acer tech support was taking ages so I decided to return it since I was still within the 30-day window. I did quite a bit of research on the black screen issue online, and this is apparently a common problem with Acer machines. Either the monitor drivers are messed up, or the bit that ""plugs"" the monitor part into the laptop comes out. Either way, I was not willing to compromise the warranty for something that will likely happen again.While the machine worked, it was fine but the batter life was definitely under 12 hours, and despite it having an SSD I did not notice it being particularly fast, especially considering the fact that it was new and had hardly any data/programs/documents on it. Overall, a disappointment unfortunately. I went with Acer because I have had an Acer Chromebook for 5+ years that is still going strong but now doubt my commitment to this brand...",0
(Computer): Works as advertised.,0
(A nice budget gaming machine.): Bought for grandson to do home school with Covid and he likes to play games on line. He is happy so far. Unit boots fast and looks nice. He doesn't play super intense games so response is okay so far.,0
(Fast! How did I ever go without it?): Fast! How did I ever go without it?,0
"(Light & powerful): This is an outstanding laptop. It is light & compact, and really powerful. I mostly use it for work/office stuff, stream a lot of videos and it does that great, and I game a little and it's more than capable for all aspects. HDMI out, plenty of USB plugs. Gets a little hot on the bottom so be wary of putting onto cloth surfaces without ventilation, but man does it run fast. Touchscreen is nice but I use it sparingly, thumbprint option is cool, and the graphics and sound are both very good.",0
"(Final straw): This is the third and final time I let Asus get away with scamming me.first 2 laptops I got were DOA, this one might as well have been.After using it for over a year, I can say it's the single worst laptop I've ever owned.The fingerprint scanner only works 10% of the time.The 2-in-1 tablet mode doesn't play well on windows 10, and keeps getting stuck with the onscreen keyboard in laptop mode.It crashes whenever the screen shuts off, and has to be power cycled to come back on.It's lost all network devices twice, which I had to manually install from a usb.This will be the last Asus product I ever buy",0
(Excellent Product for the Price): I bought this product for my wife and she is happy with the laptop.,0
(Over priced did not work properly BEWARE. Minus 10 stars): Thought this to be an ok mid- priced unit. Liked it at first. Then it kept dropping off line. The dreaded blue screen shot of rebooting. This happened about every 5-10 minutes. Two other computers in my house do not do that. Internet is fine. Sent it back as defective. They deducted $91.47 as a restocking fee. FOUND THAT TO BE EXCESSIVE. Do not buy this unit. Purchased a new one at Best Buy and it works perfectly.,0
"(Un excelente regalo): Mi novia está feliz con su laptop, está encantada con lo ligera y rápida que es, así que la recomiendo mucho",0
(Five Stars): All that was promised,0
"(Waste of money.): This laptop was a complete waste of money. When I received my item I was very anxious to set it up, upon setting it up I realized this computer had been used before. Someone else’s emails and passwords were saved. The navigation pad did not work. Only the keys did. This laptop kept freezing and programs would fail. Don’t buy this.",0
(Customer Service is horrendous): Three weeks after I bought this laptop I started having issues with the D drive. All the icons would just disappear from the main screen. I'd have to restart my computer. This was not acceptable for my work. I tried to return the laptop. I bought it off Amazon and it came through BrownBox so there was zero customer service. They could NOT have cared less. I will never purchase an item like that on Amazon again.,0
"(Love the size of this computer): Love the size of this computer, but it takes an act of God to get the keyboard to work with any degree of ease.",0
(👌): Good buy if on sell,0
"(Great for students): I kept reading about bloatware but I'm having no problems with memory. I'm an older college student so I'm not using this laptop for gaming and other nonschool stuff. I write papers, do homework and access Canvas with no problems. I can also do e-mail and watch videos and stuff on Facebook. Good basic laptop. It has Google Docs not MS Office so I've had to adapt but it's not a huge issue.",0
"(Great value!): Bought this for work; I need it for MS-Word, excel, and gmail. The keyboard is fantastic; great key action, not mushy like so many other laptop keyboards. Boots up super fast b/c of the SSD. Runs cool. It's very lightweight and thin. Battery life is average. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase.",0

"(If you plan to expand storage space...): As the headline leads on, I bought the 12th Gen i7 version RTX 3070 of the Pulse GL66. It DOES NOT have a 2.5 inch space or slot. It does however has a second NVME slot for storage next to the battery plug when you open it up; please buy a NVME if you plan to expand storage. It may not read the first time. Look for guides online for command prompt and diskpart for the laptop to read the extra NVME. (: Otherwise, it's a great laptop I managed to get a a bargain. Step up from my i7 8th gen GTX 1060 laptop I've had for a few years.",0
"(This Chromebook has far exceeded my expectations!): I really love this Chromebook! It's super fast. No comparison to a Windows laptop. I love that it is a Samsung, because it is a quality item. Sturdy construction, yet very light weight. Not only is it WAY faster than my old Windows laptop, but it doesn't get hot! The keyboard is comfortable and allows me to type at top speed. The touch screen is a must have feature for me and one is sensitive and works perfectly. Also, you can run Android apps on it! You just need to go into settings and turn on the feature that allows you to run Android apps. It comes with a stylus that pops out of a right-side compartment under the keyboard. I charged it 3 days ago and it's still has 55% left after several hours use. I'm very happy with my choice to purchase this Chromebook. It is worth every penny.",0

"(There is alot to cover with this laptop): So again there is alot with this laptop, id strongly suggest that you read everything i have to say.i give this laptop a 5 star because its incredible, the control center it comes with is very bad though. i had to delete it to be able to run better frames, when i first got it i hopped on fortnite immediately since my desktop is only a 2060 i was exited to so what a 3060 can truly do, as i got on i i turned on max frames and loaded into creative, i was lagging decently and my frames where at 140-40. i get 200+ on my 2060 so at first my heart sunk, i was so worried because i got this laptop as a basic replacement for my pc so i could have a dual pc setup, but i didnt panic to much, i thought about the reviews and they said the control center worked terrible, after i uninstalled it, which only took my 2 minutes, i was getting 400-500 frames everywhere in the game, i spent 400 dollars for my 27 inch gaming monitor, 240hz, but i swear this monitor is alot better, i was not playing better though because i had switch set ups completely but i can tell ill get better with tis laptop, i bought it for 1299, which i do believe is the best price for a 3060 and an intel core i7 11800H and a 240 hz monitor, i couldnt find anything better and i looked for 3 months straight. some bad things about the laptop, is that the battery is so BAD!!! if you want to have a laptop for all day then you'll have to go into settings and turn the hz to 60, now i dont think i need a good battery, i mean its actually not bad its just that its a gaming laptop its not meant to be unplugged for 9 hours straight, also the camera, the camera is terrible, not only is it at the bottom of the screen but the colors and frame and resolution you get on the camera is terrible, i would recommend this laptop if your only choosing it because it has a camera lolOther then that, i do believe that this laptop is truly amazingBy your favorite YoutuberLove NAFIN",0

(Do not buy this laptop): Went through 2 of these and returned with the same issue. Both times one of the fans had a failure within 30 mins of use. Sounded like a grinding noise. There’s is a long list of people complaining online about the same issue. Clear manufacturing fault and Dell should be ashamed of themselves for not recalling this laptop.,0

Currently, as I received it, it cannot connect to the internet because it was shipped without the network drivers installed. I will be taking it to Best Buy tomorrow, but it is disappointing to say the least to get a new laptop that is not functional out of the box.",0
(TRUE): The laptop is pretty laptop. For the specs you pay for you get a good deal and it is a pretty good slick desgin. I want to put it out there I just got it. But from using it it's pretty nice. If you got the money do it and like to play games I guess I will edit it once I play a game. The game I will be playing is rust.,0
(Don’t buy!): Really slow and closed out the internet everyone I was using it...,0
(MSI Gaming Laptop RTX 3070 review): This laptop is great for gaming and everything else. I did a lot of research as to which I’d buy and what graphic card I wanted. The Ray Trace 3070 is worth the money. The overall look of the laptop is unique. The artist that designed it did a fantastic job in all the small details. I’m using this MSI laptop for high end graphics programs as well as some good old gaming.,0

"(Need to tweak a few things to optimize the machine): Pro's-----1. 3.27# for a 16"" 2-in-1 machine, can't beat that.2. 2560x1600 WQXGA, 16:10 aspect ratio3. Two PCIE 4.0 M.2 SSD slots, the Samsung PM9A1 MZVL22T0HBLB specs are pretty impressive, within a few hairs of a Samsung 980 Pro. I have a 4TB Sabrent Rocket Q4 in the second slot4. LG utilities, particularly LG Smart Assistant, are an improvement over the 11th Gen 2021 models. Can now set battery powering thresholds.5. Keyboard has good depth and is very tactile and I'm very used to ThinkPads' keyboards to which it compares favorably.Con's------1. It does very much want to overheat right above the FN6 & 7 keys on the bezel, if you crack the bottom to put in a second M.2 SSD you'll see that there's plenty of room for a bigger heat sink. I pasted the CPU with Kryonaut and run a balanced power mode, also have tweaked the CPU with ThrottleStop and now it runs like a charm.2. Glossy screen, should have been matte.3. The 32GB RAM is a big step over the stop-gap 16t90p-k.aab7u1 2021 model with 16GB RAM I've been using for the past 5 months.4. Definitely should have come with Win11 Pro instead of Home. If you have an old Win7 or Win10 Pro key you can upgrade for free, easily enough Googled on how to do that.Fix the above con's and it's definitely in MacBook Pro, ThinkPad killer territory.",0
"(Great for school!): I really like the this laptop. I've had it for 4 months already and no issues yet. Great for school! It is a little heavier than other laptops, but I want a big screen and I knew that the was going to be expected. For the price, it was a no brainer.",0

(Great for regular Use): IF you are looking for a chromebook just do to the Normal such as youtube search schooling then this is Perfect.

"(Gigabyte Auros 15P KD for Content Creation): This laptop contains everything as advertised in the product description. My version does contain an Intel I7 11th Gen 8-core processor, NVidia 3060 6GB video card and Thunderbolt. I use the creator video drivers and they work well with the applications I use.I can't say much on how the OS as shipped was since I clean-installed Windows 11 Home on a WD Black 1TB drive and upgraded memory to 32GB. I used Crucial Scanner to find compatible memory and purchased 32GB (model CT2K16G4SFRA32) from Amazon.The laptop has enough USB connections for most users and Thunderbolt. I utilize the HDMI and run off an external monitor while at home. It works as designed and expected. This system runs Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer smooth and fast, similar to the desktop that I am replacing this laptop with.There are no issues with the laptop screen such as light bleed or any dead pixels. The keyboard types well for a general use while traveling but I use a wireless keyboard and mouse while at home.Updates are easy to to check via the Gigabyte Control Center.That is pretty much it.

(A bit heavier than I thought.): A bit heavier than I thought.,0
"(Fair for the price): It's not bad for the price range, I'm a bit on the fence whether or not I want to keep it or not. What I don't like so far: USB-C doesn't support Thunderbolt, one of the USB -A ports is 2.0, which is literally stupid, and the RTX 3070 is a truly low performance 3070. Not only is it the lower power version which equates to lower performance, not listed in the description is that it is a Max-Q version, which means even lower performance. Max-Q is supposed to be quieter and cooler, however from the sounds of the fans when this thing is used for gaming, it's loud, so you get a loud, underperforming 3070 compared to other mobile 3070 GPUs. As I write this, I'm leaning towards returning, and spend a couple hundred dollars more so I get everything I want, instead of settling because it's ""OK for the price"".",0

(Worst Computer Ever): The notebook stop working after 4 months. Would not recognize SSD boot drive. Added 2nd 1tb drive twice. Remove both & attached to my game desktop & both drive were corrupt. Both are unusable.,0
(working good): so far my Dell laptop working excellent,0
"(Don't buy open box, it was returned for a reason.): I got open box and ended up returning after blue screen happened to me twice. Also I had GPU crush few times playing Bannerlord (not the beefiest game). It was getting hot really quick even tho sticker on front said something cool about advanced cooling system ??Overall bad experience but I like to believe I got defected product. Maybe it actually sucks but I'm not in position to judge brand new product.",0
the screen hinge that raises the back for more air,0
(DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!): This seller is a scumbag. Computer was freezing over and over while I was trying to set it up. I knew something wasn’t right. I wasted over TWO HOURS trying to get this thing setup. I call dell support and sure enough this laptop is NOT NEW. It was purchased from Best Buy originally over 245 days ago. Even after a google “powerwash” whatever the $@&! lame excuse that is for a reset the laptop was STILL crashing. Screw you Happy Ranger/Oceanus. Buy new tech in a store where you can clearly see it’s new.,0
(Returned it.): You can’t add anything to this unless it’s in the chrome store. Wanted it as a spare for using with a zebra printer solely used to ship my ebay items out of our basement. No luck. It will NOT work.,0
(cool laptop): cool laptop,0
"(Baller): Finally replaced my trusty 10 plus year old Sony. I like Lenovo as I use them for work. So, I got a nice Lenovo gaming laptop. Tons of performance on modern titles at a great price.",0
"(Just received my laptop, hopefully it works perfectly well as expected.): Thank you",0
"(Great Machine for the cost): I had my old gaming laptop stolen and it was so expensive that I just didn't get a new one for a long while. I saw this one on special one weekend, so I just bit the bullet and grabbed it came very quickly and it is wayyy faster than my other laptop that was almost 5X the cost. after I loaded all of my games and work programs (I use a ton of programs for many companies) it still boots up in 3 seconds and the wireless internet is way faster. and the turbo mode button is nutsss. Anyway. Great buy.",0
"(very good): ive only had it for a couple days and it works very well, the battery life sucks but other than that its a pretty good laptop, ive done some school work on it and it works with my schools google stuff, i would reccomend this to someone, and its way bigger than i expected.",0
"(Great for the price): For a used product It looks just like new, nothing to complain.At first the OS was kind of buggy but after a clean re-install the laptop becomes a rocket, extremally silence under normal use but in game mode is noisy, dual booting works perfect with linux pop OS,",0
(Small Business Start-up): This is the perfect laptop/Chromebook for my small business startup. The battery life is top notch and it connected to my wireless HP printer flawlessly.,0
(Fast and looks good. Worked like a charm out of the box ...): Fast and looks good. Worked like a charm out of the box and has been used 4+ hrs daily for past 4 months. It's a great laptop for the money. The SSD that allows the quick boot of windows is awesome.,0
The screen is really incredible and the bezels are so small that it just looks like one whole screen!,0
Sound is good. Can hear the dialog in my movies quite fine. The music sounds nice.,0
"Screen looks good, touch-pad nice, a full size laptop at this price",0
"(For $1,260 it’s a bargain!): Laptop is amazing-Yea fans do get loud when gaming but you have the option to use turbo or extreme mode-I recommend buying a cooling pad (IETS GT300 is the best one, I bought it myself)- the laptop has DTX spacial audio built in for headphone users so invest in a good pair of headphones as well- fans are not noticeable when wearing headphones during gaming even on turbo mode- Intel i7 11gen, 144 hZ, RTX 3060 are phenomenal componentsOverall laptop score 10/10, this includes the performance, graphics, weight, screen, GPU and CPU, and the bargain of a price",0
"(Runs Steam like a Champ): Love the laptop, very nice quality feel. Laptop runs Steam games like a Boss. Just don't try to game on battery alone, when the system is cranking in game mode it smashes the battery charge in about an hour. When not gaming and just watching Netflix or web browsing you get a much better battery charge play time. Just a nice all around laptop, great at playing the games I love and stunning screen display for the graphics and Netflix nights!",0
(Very good laptop): Screen quality is exceptional.,0
"(Keyboard hard to see for old folks): Excellent performance. My only gripe is that the keys are hard to read for old folks like me. That said, I bought it for my children to use, so might not be a problem.",0
(POWERHOUSE! OUTSTANDING MACHINE): This PC is POWERFUL. Has run every game on max settings with EASE. It also doubles as my WFH rig and handles everything without issues,0
"(Liviano, muy estilizado, y rápido): Super su figura y aprovechamiento, como su peso, el rendimiento también es muy bueno.",0
"(Pleased so far): I have started to install everything on this computer and play some games, and everything so far so good. It is quiet, has great sound and no problems playing the games I need. Has the good looks too",0
Touchpad is good for browsing the web,0
"(Excellent performance and value, but coil whine is a dealbreaker.): Let me start by saying almost everything about this laptop is great. The design is sleek and pleasing, it doesn't scream ""I'm a gamer"", it is lightweight, the parts all feel like good quality parts, and the performance is unbelievable. Coming from an outdated GTX 960M laptop, using this felt like a dream come true.Unfortunately, right from the minute I booted the PC up, I was met with a very obnoxious static/electronic/beeping noise coming from within the case. I thought it might go away, but after some research, I found that I was experiencing coil whine, which, from what I understand, is basically vibrations of small components of the motherboard, and results from cheap outsourced parts. The coil whine produced by the laptop is far too audible for me, and is definitely a dealbreaker. For a less expensive PC, maybe, but when I'm paying 2k+ for a brand new, top of the line gaming rig, I won't tolerate these kinds of things. I'll definitely be returning it.Additionally, from the few other reviews I've read on Amazon regarding the new RTX (2060, 2070, 2080) series of this laptop, others are experiencing the same issue; so its probably a widespread issue with this model. For that reason, I would strongly advise against buying this laptop or any of the Strix Scar II RTX series. Search ""coil whine"" on YouTube if you want to hear what its like trying to operate this machine. There are far too many solid value RTX machines on the market right now to tolerate coil whine.All in all, I am very disappointed, as aside from the coil whine, this laptop is near perfect for my needs. Oh well, time to give MSI a try ;)",0
"(Awesome laptop at a great price): I got this laptop for the purpose of college/graduate school, and am so far highly satisfied with the laptop. It is incredibly light and thin, and runs very quickly! It is a very compact size, has a very sharp display, and is very affordable. Would definitely recommend this laptop to any college student!",0
(Five Stars): Was a great gift,0

(Five Stars): very good laptop. good performance.,0

(No touch screen.): Caution - its not a touch screeen gadget.,0
"(No Nvidia graphics card?): Great overall laptop but when I bought it it seemed fine but now the graphics aren’t measuring up to what they should be, turns out the laptop I bought never came with the Nvidia Gefore graphics card that said the laptop had. When trying to figure out what it meant i’ve opened up Nvidia control panel only to get the response of “No Nvidia graphics card detected”. If i’m doing something wrong help would be much appreciated.",0
(VERY Disappointed): Never will buy Chromebook again. Also issues with touch screen. Really upset I cant return or exchange it.,0
the graphics seems to not be compatible with any version of Photoshop,0
"(Love): Came faster than expected,might weight and advance best little investment u can make for working from home . No complaints yet",0
The 144HZ frame rate is butter smooth and totally worth sacrificing a 4K display for.,0
"(Amazon's returns process is AWESOME!. WiFi issue seems to be solved after Chrome O/S update in early June.): I encountered the WiFi issues noted in other reviews. My research indicated it was a hardware issue and I promptly returned to Amazon for a new unit (Side note: Amazon's returns process is AWESOME!). New unit arrived in < 1 week. Thank you Amazon.Alas, the new unit still had the WiFi issue, albeit less frequently.I wish HP would note something on their site about this model having WiFi issues.Besides the WiFi issue, the unit I have is great. High definition screen is crisp. Chrome O/S is smooth and fast. The beauty of this whole thing is the simplicity. No crashes, no bloatware. Just simple computing that meets all of my home needs. Thank you Google.UPDATE: Chrome O/S firmware update in early June fixed the WiFi issue. The WiFi has not dropped for 2 weeks.",0
(Feature rich PC/tablet for your dollar): Bottom line is this a fantastic PC for the price. I have purchased and researched many PCs over the last 20+ years and I also work for a very large technology company. This PC has a fantastic balance of features. If you want a spot on review of the details reference BHATTA’S review from May 2018.The only slight downfall I have found like other has been the average to below average battery life.,0
(Decent nothing stand out): Decent but nothing great,0
"(Excellent Laptop For the Price): I love this laptop. I am using it mainly for my school work, I do full time classes at university and some are online. I needed something light and fast that I could travel with. If you are looking for something that is a powerhouse laptop at this price point you are fooling yourself. I am surprised I got this good of a deal on a laptop with a SSD in it. I bought this laptop with the mindset that I wanted something that was fast and could do a light work load because I have a powerhouse gaming Desktop PC at home, so I did not need something over the top in a laptop. I also wanted it to be light for travel. If you are looking for something that will run High FPS Games or Adobe products smoothly I 100% don't recommend this PC. This computer can handle simple games, I like to play My Time at Portia and it can run League of Legends, but most potatoes can, so it's not a gaming PC by any means, but you need to check the Games themselves and see the lowest setting you can run them on (Like you should if you are a gamer and wanting a new laptop).The size of the SSD is not the greatest, so if you do not use things like Google doc's that save to the cloud you will be wanting to get an external drive or an SD card. I believe you can install a HDD on here, but am unsure and do not plan to myself. I have a 1TB external drive for if I need to move files between computers and as a general rule of just having my files backed up to several places.Pros:- Boots up in seconds- Runs smooth for everyday light use, Internet Browsing, Watching Youtube, Hulu, Netflix- Plays some games that don't need high graphics cards or processors- SD card slot so I can extend storage if need be- Has an Ethernet Port and a HDMI port if you travel and want to put something on the bad hotel TV'sCons:- The Bloatware, so dumb and useless- No others right nowAgain my review is based on this product at this price point. I didn't expect this PC to run a graphics intensive Game, I would never expect a 400$ laptop to do so. I love that it came with an SSD, the storage is fine for my needs as I mainly use Google Docs for school and have an external drive. I have had no issues with the Wi-fi on the laptop as of yet, I do not expect to. If you are looking for a laptop that will offer you speed and be a great travel companion if you are in college or travel for work, you should get this one.Last thing I do recommend installing a fresh version of Windows 10 so you don't get the bloatware, or you can just uninstall the bloatware through Programs and Features. Up to you, but the bloatware you will get with almost any new Laptop.",0
(Would recommend): Daughter is happy with it. Easy to use.,0
(does not include hard drive as advertised): The product stated inclusion of a 1TB hard drive. This was not ptovided.,0
"(Great Product): I bought this to play Baldur's Gate III, since my old laptop was outdated. I didn't want to spend too much, but was looking for a good gaming laptop. This definitely fit the bill. It played the game with zero lag will all the video settings on high. The graphics and speed are amazing.",0
"(Great performance for games and beautiful screen): I needed an upgrade from my dud HP Omen laptop, and the MSI quality shows. The keyboard, screen quality and refresh rate, and performance while gaming are all superb. The fans can get loud, but they get the job done and keep the computer from getting too hot. Things were great but my F12 key fell off soon after I got it - all the other keys are fine, so I'm not sure why this one was defective. Everything else has been better quality than other laptops I've had, but I have to take points off for that.",0
So I received my AeroBook yesterday from a crowd funding campaign.,0
(Always buy new): Love my laptop,0
"(Great gaming laptop doing its job well.): Great laptop for anyone that wants a portable gaming machine.Great for game development using Unity3D and Unreal Engine.I would recommend finding a good cooling solution as it might help to preserve the laptop for more years of use.I am not saying that temperatures are bad, but it is a gaming computer, so it will get to about 70-90 degrees for the CPU and 70-85 degrees for the GPU while gaming on it.With normal use, like surfing the web and watching shows (Youtube, etc.), the temperatures of the GPU usually do not exceed 60 degrees, and the CPU does not exceed 70 degrees.But of course, it might change a little bit depending on your environment's temperatures.I am using this laptop in a room with an air conditioner, so you should take this into a consideration.Bear in mind, that this laptop doesn't have a camera, in case you need one you will need to buy it separately.",0
"(Perfect): Excellent notebook, fast, light, the screen has a perfect resolution.",0
"(Super fast!): Super fast! This is replacing a 7 year old i7 HP pavilion 17 inch. The 8th gen i5 is way faster and I had the old one optimized for fast boot! The best part is this was $150 less than my old one. Great value, I just hope the holiday deals dont leave me sad ;-)",0
"(Nice when working but poor design): This worked well for 9 months and the battery died. The retailer sent it back for me and they replaced the battery. Six months later, the keyboard doesn't work for certain keys. This is a common problem and the fix is involved. HP should offer to fix these as the bent wires inside are apparently the defect. Guess I'll have to spring for an Apple MacBook as my iPad, iPod, and iMac have been impeccable. HP used to mean quality, but poor design and no company acknowledgemenet is bad.",0
"(Track Pad): Well I will hate to admit it, but the previous comment regarding the track pad is still an issues. While using the track pad, it feel unnatural and wobblily, and I willing to bet it will get you upset.",0
SSD has a fast boot and resume from sleep,0
(Cool): It works.,0
"(Does not work well with Zoom): In fall 2020, through my school, I have to be in Zoom meetings every day. This particular Chromebook from 2018, which I purchased in August 2019, does not have the oomph or the hardware to handle Zoom. My screen freezes, my Zoom audio is terrible (it sounds like I'm either underwater or from ""The Exorcist"") and I have felt Zoom embarrassed. Plus my Zoom meetings every day requirement is part of my job. It's OK and functional but now I have to invest in something more recent just to have a decent Zoom connection. Don't get this if you need it for Zoom and for work!----------There's more - I'm adding to this review as of 14 March 2022. Chrome is sending me messages now that says that this Acer 2018 Chromebook will ""no longer be supported by Chrome as of June 2022."" Meaning Chrome will not be sending updates, etc. I don't know if that is for this specific model or for all its Chromebooks, which is pretty greedy on Google Chrome's part. After the pandemic, when just about every school kid in America and in every school district has invested heavily in making sure students have Chromebooks, is this Chrome's way of saying - now you have to buy our new model Chromebook to get updates? Anyhow, on the guess that my Chromebook will ""no longer be supported by Chrome as of June 2022,"" I cannot recommend this Acer 2018 model - it does not do Zoom well at all and now it very soon won't be supported at all. Boo, Acer! Boo, Chromebook!",0
(My Laptop is broken.): My Laptop needs to get fixed on Amazon and My Laptop wasn’t working since Last Sunday because My Laptop was black and white Last Sunday. My Laptop wasn’t charging on my Outlet good.,0

"(Excellent): Great buy. Using it since day one for work. I am a medical interpreter and I work on camera and so far it responds great. The keyboard very comfortable, I also love how light and thin is the laptop. I couldn’t be happier.",0
(Good buy): Pretty good product for its price,0
"(Hefty but Heroic! A real Gamer’s laptop): This is the first gaming laptop I ever owned, although I have owned about 6 other laptops previously. This is a great gaming platform with just a few cons.First, the Pros: Nice sized display with high resolution and a clear, bright display. Sound is incredible in quality, although the volume is very low. Keyboard is crispy, and the backlight can be dimmed or brightened or turned off. Touchpad is responsive although I prefer to use a wireless mouse instead. WIFI has a good strong signal and connections are quick and reliable. Plenty of ports, and built-in cooler makes this a well rounded player. Upgrades are easy to do, and with 2 NVME slots plus a 2.5 drive slot, you won’t be hurting for storage space. The memory can be upgraded to 32GB if you need it.CONS: just a few, and none are deal breakers for me. The first is the weight. Not sure what it is, but this is no lightweight. It’s hefty!! Second, Acer went for some fancy design with the case that has the corners chopped diagonally. It’s not actually sharp, but it can be a bit pokey if you’re balancing it with one hand on your knee while battling behemoths in Dauntless. That’s pretty much all I could find to say negatively.All in all, this is a great laptop at a reasonable price for the specs. It will definitely stand up to whatever you can dish out in your favorite games.",0
(Light and versatile): Used by my daughter for her school work,0
(Five Stars): Luv it very much,0
"(Unsatisfactory my purchase!): Whenever I watched a movie, the sound didn't come out right. The screen was not good and the soundtrack was awful.",0
(Superior Quality): Thoroughly impressed with the quality and features of this product!!,0
(Just set up.): I just set up this computer to do my graphics design work. It is a beautiful computer and lighter than I thought it would be. The set up was very easy and I look forward to having the power I need to accomplish my graphics projects.,0
The touch screen is very quick and responsive.,0
(Best deal out there on a laptop that can be easily upgraded if needed.): Best deal out there on a laptop that can be easily upgraded if needed. Price is a deal.,0
"(Perfect but...): The product arrived in perfect aesthetic condition but when i got to finally use it, the right speaker has a distorcion when punch it above 80 in the volume level, i mean its not a deal breaker but a mention of it in the description whould be nice, other than that its the best electronics purchase i've ever done, thanks a lot on the great deal Amazon",0
(Five Stars): Speakers are awesome,0
"(Vertical viewing angles aren't the best, the fans are a little loud, but overall very nice.): I'm going to be writing this review coming off my old Asus G751JY-DH71 with a GTX 980m, 24GB DDR3, 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD, and an i7-4710HQ.I bought this laptop kinda out of nowhere because one of my good friends decided that he wished to buy my old laptop, the one that I named above, within a week's time. So with the final 7 days that I had my old laptop, I went searching online for something that could replace it. Long story short, after searching through many different sites (including eBay and Newegg), I ended up landing on this laptop because of it's (relatively) affordable price tag of about $1450 whenever I bought mine off of Amazon Warehouse just a few days ago.For anybody who has an i7-4710HQ or a GTX 980m, the i7-8750H is about 50% faster than the i7-4710HQ and probably any other pre-8th gen Intel CPU. and the GTX 1070 is about 2x faster than the GTX 980m. Compared to my old Asus, this laptop is significantly thinner and lighter. It still shocks me after about a couple of days of ownership just how light the laptop is whenever I pick it up to move it around (not that the old Asus was particularly heavy, but it was noticeable whenever it was in a bag) especially considering how much more powerful this is compared to the Asus.I have two negatives about this laptop (that aren't really too huge of a deal to me personally, but they could be a dealbreaker to some others): 1. the vertical viewing angles of the laptop screen aren't the best. However, thankfully, since the laptop hinge can go back a pretty large amount, the vertical viewing angle thing ended up not being an issue for me at all. Also, it's a 60hz non-GSync display but I bought this laptop realizing that it wasn't able to go to 120hz or do GSync, but if you want to buy this laptop, be aware of that. 2. The laptop is a fair bit louder than my old Asus laptop. However, you can create custom fan profiles for the CPU and GPU that can alleviate this issue, and headphones block out the sound very well, too.A few final notes (not really negatives, just something to be aware of) are that the Windows key is on the right side of the laptop, the Numpad is kinda small, and you have to press the Space key a little harder than the rest of the keys. The keyboard's very nice and I'd say Steelseries did better on this keyboard than I had on my old Asus and I thought that was pretty good to begin with. Also, if you intend on removing the back cover of the PC, after removing the screws and opening the pins, pull it on the side that has the two USB-A ports, the SD card slot, and the power cable as pictured above. If not, then you can risk snapping the motherboard in half if you pull on it from the side with the HDMI and the USB-C.Tl;dr is that the laptop is really fast, but it's 60Hz, the vertical viewing angles and fan sound aren't the best, and the keyboard has a few tiny quirks that aren't issues necessarily but it takes getting used to. Also, if you plan on opening the laptop, after opening the screws and pins, pull on it from the side that the picture is shown (2 USBs, SD Card, and Power cord side)",0
(Great laptop for the price): Screen bright and clear with 144Hz refresh rate. The keyboard was nice to type with. The speakers are loud enough,0
"(Won't turn on 1/2 the time, freezes randomly): The screen won't turn off 1/2 the time, so I have to turn off then turn back on again. It randomly freezes also, requiring force shutdown.This is just within 1 month of owning. I will be contacting support, but a new laptop shouldn't have these problems.Wish I went with another brand.",0
(RESOLUCION): Tiene una resolución muy efectiva. Sus mandos responden rapidamente y es amigable su sistema. Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra.,0
"(Una buena opción para gamers.): Recién la compré y en general me ha gustado todo, lo único que la haría mejor sería tener más espacio de almacenamiento, pero bueno, comprando una ssd de más espacio se mejora eso.",0
"(Solid computer with fast processing and refresh speed): It was purchased for work to process CAD and Lumion-3D, not gaming. But our design work puts heavy demands on video, memory and speed, similar to gaming. So far, it's performing perfectly and doing everything we need it to. It's not particularly light weight but what do you expect from a large screen laptop. Really happy with this purchase and price.",0
"(Excellent laptop): Excellent laptop. Use in college. I love the long battery life and how quick it is. It also has a very comfortable keyboard, which is great when writing papers.",0
"(it's a great computer. Awesome for everyday use.): it's a great computer. Awesome for everyday use. Also, can handle any game on low settings. The GPU is kinda weak to play any higher. The resolution is flawless.",0
(Dangerous): Started sparking around the power connector about four months after purchase. Called Acer and they sent me a label immediately and I sent it in for repair. They sent it back saying it’s not covered under warranty. I threw it in the trash. Beware.,0
It looks professional while maintaining a sleek design,0

(Never leave your laptop open for to long): Lucrative with my business,0
"(An Amazing Gaming Laptop for the price!): I purchased this for $1,399 from and it was a direct Amazon.com purchase. This was a graduation gift for my son, and for the price, and features included this was the best deal I could find anywhere! I had purchased my son an MSI laptop roughly 2 years ago which was my first MSI purchase and he has been happy with it's performance, so at this price and knowing that it would perform well for him in college (with a little gaming on the side LOL) this laptop was a steal! The 144Hz display is noticeably improved from the previous laptop's screen, and the RTX 2070 has already allowed some seriously cool gaming on the highest settings! Anyone for some Raytraced Minecraft?!?! Apparently it gets a little hot when games are using the hardware to it's fullest... but that seems to be expected on all these current gaming laptops. The bottom has plenty of open mesh area to allow dissipation but probably makes for a hot lap... recommend a lap desk of some kind, maybe with it's own cooling fans. The keyboard is more seriously cool tech, Steel Series provides full RGB lighting per key with amazing preset effects. Looks amazing!!! If you can find this laptop for such a low price I would highly recommend it!!! P.S. I now see this is already sold out from Amazon and priced much higher from other sellers.",0

(Love this LG Gram laptop!): Nothing to dislike about this computer. I am not a gamer. Had a 17 in 5 yr old Toshiba that was slowing down. This computer is so much fun. Takes only about 5 seconds to boot up. Used to wait 5 minutes. Very light and not a pain to pick up as most laptops are. Can handle the 5-G Wi-Fi technology and that may be why I now get 200+ internet speed when I was lucky to get 20 on the old laptop. SSD drive hardly ever heats up and when the fan does come on you can barely hear it. Well worth the extra money. Listed for $1999 but got it for $1399 on Cyber Monday. What a steal!,0
Tombraider was absolutely beautiful and it easily maintained a 60 fps frame rate without issues,0
"(Good laptop, bad case.): I read some sterling reviews of people wondering why anybody would not like this computer. I'll tell you why. I've owned Acer and Asis and both cases have failed. Look it up. The hinges on the top fail - one at a time - until soon you're propping the screen against whatever and can't take it anywhere. The case is simply not built to last. It' OK for most projects, but it will fail. Go on Google and see for yourself. There's plenty of advice on how to fix it and none of them work. I had some some success early on taping it all together with electrical tape but that failed too. Now it's propped up against my printer and I can't close the top. At all. Also, be prepared to buy a power cord once a month.",0
"(Decent mid range gaming laptop MSI GL65 Leopard): I've been using this laptop for several months now. It's been mostly great, but there are a couple of things to mention:1. Within a month, I had an internal fan failure that caused horrible rattling, probably the bearings failing. I've since read this is a pretty common failure, and for it to happen so quickly, I'm mentioning it first since it'll likely happen to others. It would be fixed under warranty, but due to Covid, I'd be without a laptop for well over a month, so I chose to fix it myself with buying the part and installing it from an outside vendor.2. Even with the highest fan settings, the left-hand side of the keyboard gets pretty hot. I've never had any overheating issues, but I'd never run this without the highest fan setting on.3. Preinstalled software sometimes conflicted with games, specifically their MSI Overwolf software. I disable it before running those games.4. External speakers are under the laptop. You'll need headphones to hear anything with clarity.The CPU is robust and runs all of my games with the highest settings. If you're a gamer like I am, you'll be looking to upgrade the SDD soon, as 1TB just isn't enough these days. The keyboard is a disco wonderland and adds a bit of fun. Overall, a solid 4 star laptop that should give me years of service.",0
"(Wifi Driver wont stay installed): Never had so many issues with a laptop before. Contacted HP numerous times and instead of acknowledging the laptop has an issue, they kept trying to restart it, reflash the OS, etc. with weeks of back and forth as it would work for a few days before disappearing again. worst part is after all of this time and no lasting solution, the return option on Amazon is gone, and HP is saying thats how we have to get it replaced. I would have expected better from HP... Do not recommend at all.",0
"(broken microphone): I got a faulty product. Microphone not working, you can just here a low scratchy sound. Bluetooth randomly stops working and if I try to reconnect my Bluetooth mouse the computer will freeze, have to restart in order to get Bluetooth to work again. Computer randomly makes a loud pop sound followed by static, usually when an error or admin message appears (very weird, not sure what's going on there).If it were not for these problems, computer would get 5 stars",0

"(A Very Premium Feeling Product): 3DMark Fire Strike: 12907The Razer Blade feels premium. From the CNC aluminum body to the impressive specs to its striking design that fits between ""business"" and ""gamer"", you can tell a lot of time and love went into this product.One concern I did have was the smudging, this machine can smudge very easily, though they were kind enough to include a microfiber cloth to help deal with that. The price is also much higher than its competitors, but you do get a premium feeling product where other product cut corners by using plastics and multiple components. There's also the issue of the RGB afterglow, if you glaze your eyes on the keyboard, you can see the red/green/blue LEDs ever so slightly. The individually lit keys do mean that games like Overwatch and Divinity Original Sin 2 can do things like highlight controls or fade in slowly as a spell waits to be usable again.",0
"(Pretty much worth the price!): This is the second time I bought a Helios 300. The previous one is the 2018 version, compared to these two not only it remain a cheap price, but also it gets much more well-designed. For example, its size is smaller, making it easier to carry, and I can add one more PCIe SSD. Looking forward maybe 2 or 3 years later Acer would make a laptop with this much upgrade!",0
(Excelente): Buenísima calidad,0
(screen needs upgrade): CPU: Great works quicklyRam: 8gb works quicklyBest budget laptop hands down....The screen though is pure garbage. viewing angles are horrible and the panel is just gray.... idk how to explain it but yeah.... it sucks but for $400 you aren't going to find a better laptop so 5 stars for the price.,0
"(Very Nice but the Touch Pad is a Little Crazy Sometimes): I have no complaints, really, except that sometimes, the touch pad is a little crazy. I write using OpenOffice software, and sometimes, the page expands all of a sudden, and I don't know what I did. Also, right click and left click (for copy, cut paste, etc) needs to be done just so. I've mostly resorted to Ctrl C, Ctrl V Ctrl X to avoid having to try the touch pad more than once. It seems you have to get the very far bottom corners for it to work right. While the single touch pad looks pretty, right and left buttons would be more practical.As far as the battery life, it's awesome! It also runs my video software just fine, mixing down short videos pretty fast. Overall, it was a smooth transition from my old laptop, and I'm pretty happy with it.",0

"(Great hardware, annoying Acer software.): Great laptop when you can catch it at a normal price. Has a great balance of cost to quality and would only recommend buying an additional SSD to install your games on. The IPS display looks great for colors and the high frame rate does really well with the games I play (FPS + RPG).The only real complaint I have with the laptop is the Acer Predator Sense software. If you follow the instructions of Acer or any forums I found, you cannot stop the program from popping up in the middle of playing a game. Even when you disable, the app doesn’t load all the way, just the annoying 4” triangle pops up in the middle of the screen at random.I uninstalled at one point but then you lose access to the functionality in the program (gpu overclocking and fan profiles).I gave the battery 3 stars because you’ll get an hour out of it but honestly you shouldn’t be playing games on a gaming laptop without plugging it in. The performance will get tuned way down to preserve battery which will get you about 30fps at best.",0

"(Yuhhh): The laptop is a workhorse and haven't failed me to this dY almost a year later, do be carwfule running multiple programs or any big games on it and try to buy USB laptop cooler to pair with if if your going to game",0
"(Decent budget gaming): The performance is totally there. The 4800H runs exactly as expected, fast. Stupid fast. The GPU is a 1660Ti with what looks to be an 80W power plan, judging by in game power limits I was seeing. Though Lenovo included some very basic overclocking tools with the machine. The combo results in decent performance in every game I have tried at 1080P (native resolution) so far.The GPU sits at a comfortable 70ish degrees (Celsius) while playing COD MW, or even during Furmark stress testing. The CPU gets a bit warm (to be expected) hitting the 90's at peak while gaming. But the system stays comfortable even during an extended gaming session.The display is decent. Great color, no obvious in game smearing, video looks sharp. Sound is mediocre on the integrated speakers. To be expected in a laptop really.Keyboard is another great keyboard from Lenovo. Responsive, good travel, sharp feedback, and decent layout. It would have been nice to have a larger number pad - but that would have meant a larger machine overall, so the choice they made makes sense. I don't care for the white backlighting, but it will do the job.The included Samsung NVME SSD was a nice touch. It has plenty of space out of the factory to install a couple games, remembering that COD:MW will consume half of it on its own. Which brings us to the first real negative. The extra M.2 slot included is a short slot. 2242, rather than the common 2280. I only found one brand of semi-reputable drives for 2242 (which I didn't feel comfortable buying), and I don't really want to remove the included 2280 just to add some space. Ended up going with a SATA based drive for now - as I could get 1TB for less than 100 bucks, and it was a brand I know I can at least get support from. The included drive tested out to 3580MB/sec read speeds, 1143 4k read (QD32). Write speeds of 2989 and 2123 4k(QD32), which isn't bad at all.The memory included on here states it is Kingston SK Hynix 3200Mhz RAM. It is running 22-22-22 timings. I found no options in the BIOS to make any adjustments to that either. I don't think you are going to get the RAM to run much, if any faster. Though 16GB is a bit short for gaming these days.The chassis is entirely plastic. It doesn't feel bad, but doesn't feel great either. It fits with the budget. Port placement is dead on though. One normal USB on each side for things you may insert/remove often (like USB flash drives) and 2 more on the rear for things you would leave in place, like a mouse dongle. Also has power, USB-C and monitor ports on the rear as well, nice and out of the way for lefties or righties.TL;DR / SummaryYou get what you pay for. It is a nice machine for the price paid. The performance isn't hampered by poor cooling, or poor choices in parts. It boots quick, games quick, and generally functions perfectly well. You give up premium build, and aesthetics to hit this price though. Not that it looks bad, as it doesn't. But no one is going to mistake it for a Surface, or a Razer Blade.",0

I think I would have been happier with the bigger screen.,0
"(Update: working better now. Old: Crash after crash after crash... Not impressed with Support so far): UPDATE 3, October/22 FINALLY!Well, it seems like I can finally say that the issue was taken care of (crossing fingers so I don't jinx myself).After sending it back, again, which by the way I didn't have to pay for shipping in any direction this time as I was under warranty when I sent it back the first time (I had extended the warranty by registering the product online, it's something they offered after purchase). I wrote some notes and added them to the return package. I seems like they listened! I had mentioned that one of their tech support agents had hinted that the issue was the graphics card. On their return notes they stated that the graphics card (I believe this would mean the whole motherboard) had been replaced. So far, I have not been able to replicate the main issue I was having, which was freezing streaky screens, which used to gravely affect my editing work. I must mention that I have not pushed the machine too much, just enough. The problem was that the freezing-streaking issue used to happen even without pushing the graphics card too hard. So, I'm happier with how it is working now, nearly two years after I purchased it.There are some caveats, however. 1. When I change the ""User Scenario"" from Extreme Performance to either Balanced or Super Battery the machine has either crashed or become unstable. I pretty much keep it on Extreme mode most of the time as I do a lot of heavy tasks. I had switched to balanced because I was using it it where I couldn't plug it and I needed the battery to last longer. 2. Although I haven't experienced the Freeze and streaks issue the laptop kind of resets my displays and seems to reset the Windows Explorer environment (but I take that over freezing and loosing my work) once in a while. I had seen this issue about 3 times now since getting it back but, surprisingly, no major crashes, other than the ones stated on point number 1 above.I'm glad that MSI kept their word and honored the warranty. I mentioned before that I had extended the warranty but, by the time I had to send it back the second time, even the extended had expired. It was understood, however, that the first fix they tried (which was practically zero) didn't work, and I was still under warranty, so they had to make it right even when my original warranty had expired.I do recommend if you're going to send yours back for repair, that you send it back with all the original components (RAM and perhaps even the Hard Drive, but mainly RAM). That way they will not ""misdiagnose"" your machine and send it back to you with no real work done (see previous updates for more context).I upped my rating from 1 star to 3 since it was a real pain in the *** to get it all straighten. (keeping fingers cross for the next 5 years ;-) )UPDATE 2 May/22Support has not improved. Admittedly, they say that ""translating"" the messages causes some delays and misunderstandings.Anyways here's the scoop:I sent the device back as is still under warranty. I had to pay for shipping however. They ""tested"" it and coincidentally, the only thing that ""failed"" was the RAM. Mind you I'm a technician myself and I've tested the RAM and it's in perfect working condition. The kicker is, of course, is that I upgraded the RAM, so it's not the original one. But, I upgraded the RAM thinking that would help with the issues I was having. NOPE. The laptop fails with the original RAM on board and with the upgraded RAM, which happens to be SAMSUNG. So, I got good quality perfectly working RAM for my new laptop (not so new anymore) but it didn't help with the freezing/crashing issue. I'm requesting for them to retest the device with the original RAM (since they say my upgrade is a ""failed one"").Needless to say, It has been an extremely slow and frustrating process, between how busy I am, the slow replies, the 'misunderstandings', having to explain to them the same thing over and over. This is probably the first and last MSI machine I'll ever buy.Update 4/6. Support keeps ignoring my messages, at least directly on their site. I will have to try their live chat service to see if that makes any difference. When something like this happens you cannot recommend their product. Even sometimes when the product is not ""high end"" but they have good support it makes them look better and you appreciate their business more. So far MSI is letting me down big time. Shame.I must start by saying that this is a powerful machine and when it works it's great. UNFORTUNATELY! I've been experiencing constant crashes/freezes when doing video editing. Needless to say that, crashes you experience when you are ""creating"" is the worst that could happen. You gotta have reliability in what you use as your main tool for video editing, you spend good money on it and expect it to do its job. This hasn't been the case for this laptop. From my very first project I experienced the first crashes and I thought an update had taken care of that initial problem, but, alas! I started another project recently and crash after crash was the story for a while. Oddly, the machine could go almost full 24hrs with no crashes, and the next day crash on me 3 or 4 times almost in a row. I had attached 2 external monitors to it and that seemed to upset things more, I had to unplug one of them to mitigate the issue. I'm concerned about whether I got a ""lemon""? Other reviewers here seem to have good experiences and little to none issues. The other point I want to make is that, yes, a full year warranty is offered but I recently contacted their Support team about this problem, and I got a dry short answer, ""do this, then do that"" No explanation as to what could be wrong, no warning as to what the suggested 'fix' risks are, etc. Not impressed so far, but I'll update this review and rating when and if the issues are taken care of.",0

"(An absolutely brilliant piece of tech with a teaspoon of minor nitpicks and one grievance.): This laptop was basically exactly what I was looking for. Before then, I never owned a true gaming PC. The only computer I owned before that wasn’t a hand-me-down was a 2016 Acer Aspire E15 with an Intel i5 and a NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics card with 8GB of memory. Needless to say, for any serious type of gaming, it was not to last. Games like Sonic Generations had the fan screaming in agony and the game would freeze at random points and games like Street Fighter V at lowest settings ran at about half speed. The only other modern gaming system I have was the Nintendo Switch, and while I love that system, it’s not the best main drive to play the latest blockbuster releases from 3rd Parties. And so, I began looking for a new gaming PC. I tried looking for a desktop all summer but I could never afford or find the parts I wanted and the prebuilt options didn’t impress me. But in September of this year I found this little guy and it had everything looking for it. I saved it up and got it at a discount of $1,100 with some extras such as a new mouse, mousepad, and backpack.When this PC came in, the difference to this and my old one was night and day. The screen’s higher refresh rates and 16 GB of RAM felt almost unreal to me for a bit, but it was a beautiful experience. The packaging was beautiful, the system itself looks gorgeous, but a gaming PC is only as good as it’s gaming capabilities were. Oh boy, was I amazed. The first thing I set up was the Dolphin emulator with Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and I got it set up in a matter of minutes and did some upscaling. With the combination of my trusted 8bitdo SN30 Pro+, it felt like a dream playing games on it. So far, I’ve loved all this thing has done for emulation. Granted, I’ve only set up stuff as recently as Wii U, but that system runs so well that I was convinced it was just some native PC port. From NES to Sega Saturn to Wii U and more, your emulation needs will be in good hands here.What about actual PC games? Don’t worry, it’s awesome on here. Personally, I don’t have too many PC games to use for reference so don’t take my word for everything. Sonic Generations ran beautifully at max settings (as it should since it’s a game from 2011), but when I got to Street Fighter V, it hit me just how much I could do with this. I can play this game with max settings on 1080p and it runs perfectly. Yeah, it’s a game from 2015/2016 on the PS4 so I should expect this, but keep in mind that my previous PC couldn’t even do this game at minimum settings and you can see why I’m so happy about this. The experience was nothing short of brilliant. And the fan, while not silent, isn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Unless you put the PC into Turbo Mode with overclocking, the fan is more than passable and won’t be much of a distraction. The speakers are great as expected, and even on lower settings are quite well and projected perfectly. I’m not the type of guy to blare my game’s volumes on 100% but if that’s you, you’ll have some fun with this guy. The screen, as mentioned, is nothing short of beautiful. Great colors, viewing angles, and a great refresh rate makes viewing stuff on this as good as you could want from a 1080p IPS display. As long as you don’t expect a $3,000 monster machine performance, you’ll be in good hands here.While I’ve raved about this PC for a while, there are a few things I could’ve wished they did better with. Thankfully, this system is decent when it comes to built in stuff but the boot-up sound is a little annoying. Thankfully, it can be turned off which I did right away. The screen, as I said before, is lovely, but I kind of wish it was a 4K panel. I’m not sure how well this guy does with 4K content, but I guess I’d rather do 1080p at 144 FPS than 4K at 60 FPS. It’s kinda up to you. The battery life isn’t hot. It’s advertising to doing about 6 hours in it’s own but I wouldn’t expect that. This is certainly something you keep on your desk plugged in at all time. Plus, performance is hit pretty badly if it’s not plugged in so this isn’t something I’d want to keep on my lap. My third biggest issue is the process of replacing storage and RAM. My last computer handled this well, with a little door to change everything on the bottom with little to no problems. But, despite being a gaming product where a majority of people would want to change this stuff easily, you can’t. You gotta take off the back, use a prying tool to lift up the click in order to expose the bottom and take it off. I don’t know what’s up with mine, but I can’t do it. I bought a Samsung 1TB M.2 drive to improve the adequate but lacking 512 GB of internal storage. But nope, the clips would not only refuse to come off no matter what I did, but the top part that I needed to get off was stick like glue. I had to stop trying because I was either going to permanently damage the insides or do more cosmetic harm to the bottom play. Thankfully, the nicks aren’t too noticeable and the only part that got scratched was the top left hand part of the bezel of the screen. But still, what gives, Acer? This is a gaming PC, not a MacBook. I get you companies like making these laptops as non-modular as possible, but you’re shooting yourself in the foot with product longevity. If it weren’t for the fact that everything else with this computer is everything I could’ve wanted, this would’ve been an absolute dealbreaker for me. But ultimately, whether or not this is a major issue to you is something I cannot declare. That’s up to you.Regardless, besides not being a $3,000 tank of a gaming PC and having some annoying restrictions in terms of user configurations, I’m nothing short of happy with this product. Compared to my last laptop, this one is the real deal that will last me throughout college. This is probably one of the few purchases I’ve made where I can say that it was worth every penny. But, c’mon Acer, stop with this bottom plate garbage. You’re better than this. Other than that, kudos to you and your engineering team earns my respect.",0

It took me a little while to get used to having so little physical memory, but with an SD card it hasn't been a problem. It's a slight adjustment going from a traditional Windows OS to Android, but again not a big deal. It works great for streaming and basic use. The HDMI connection is good to have. Most importantly, the battery life is ridiculously good and recharges quickly. It's lightweight and durable. Having had to use it frequently for video calls during COVID times, it has a great wifi connection, camera and processing to not freeze up or disconnect during a call. I don't do any gaming on this machine, so I can't speak to its use for that.",0

(Buy 2. It's worth it.): This is an amazing product for the price. I am going to buy another one for my son.,0
"(Great midrange laptop): Was able to do more than I expected with this laptop. I can play a lot of big title games with a mix of mid to high settings. The sound is about what you would expect from a laptop but nobody picks a laptop based on it's stock speakers. Says it has windows 10 but you will be asked to upgrade to 11 for free on startup. If you're looking for an affordable laptop to get started with PC gaming, I can recommend this one from my experience.",0
"(It is defective...): The computer held the charge for 5 minutes max and then stopped working.I wanted to replace that instead of return, but I couldn't.I have to return it. I was so disappointed.",0
"(Fast and efficient ! :)): Great computer! I just bought this computer from Walmart. Pavilion is always a good line of HP computers. It has a backlit keyboard with options, and I love the thin metal, but good quality feel of this machine. I have to have a dependable computer for online college and this is it! It has a fingerprint security on the side. The WiFi never cuts out for me. Be careful though bc all hp computers are prone to over heat so always use on a flat surface. This computer has battery conservation features as well as security features that make me so glad I spent the money. The warranty with HP is also wonderful. I thought about buying a Mac book air. But the price and all of the special adapters I’d need and risks of issues with Microsoft made me hold off for now. It’s a trustworthy computer for a college student.",0
"(Battery drain fast): I love having this around. It’s fast and does what it supposed to do. The only thing I don’t like is the battery drains fast. But overall, I’m happy with it.",0
"(Great ultra slim light weight for the money): Very satisfied. On line very helpful on setting up. Took over my computer and helped set it up. Perfect for my use. Of course there will always be something better value coming on the market, but was good value at the time I bought it without having to pay a fortune. Like everything except that the mouse seems very sensitive and I prefer an external mouse. Also I am not sure that the battery lasts as long as is advertised, but long enogh for my purpose.",0
(Acer Laptop Windows 11 home OS defective installation.): 8 GB of RAM is not enough to run windows 11 the laptop did not function properly due to a combination of windows 11 and windows 10 both being installed very disappointed. Also disappointed with the return policy waiting for UPS to pick up at my residence had to take time off from work and was never given a tracking number come on Amazon get with itwaiting for UPS to pick up would’ve been nice if Amazon gave me a tracking number,0
"(Overall an awesome laptop!): This is an awesome laptop for working and light gaming! A few things that may annoy people: fans do get a bit loud even if if you are not doing heavy stuff like watching Netflix or Twitch, screen is not at best at the light of a sunny day but it's not bad! Overall easily best laptop for the money that you can get in this price range.",0
(The best MacBook Air I have ?):,0
(Its definitely worth owning!!): I love it. And Its Definitely Worth The Purchase!!???,0
(Five Stars): The computer came as fast as promised!,0
(Quality and specifications): Amazing laptop and fast delivery.,0
(I dint like the laptop at all): This laptop is completely trash it keeps freezing and wont let me put my pictures on it,0
"(Very Fast Computer): This Acer computer is very well built with great specs. I love the fast 512 GB SSD drive. It makes everything so much faster. There is room for a second hard disk if you need one. The screen is bright and sharp. But it is not a touch screen.The keyboard is very responsive and is a light show on to itself....lots of pretty blue lights shining and blinking. The Trackpad is very responsive. Lots of ports, including including Thunderbolt, 3 USB ports, HDMI, Mini Display and Ethernet.There is really good ventilation to keep everything cool when gaming....vents on both sides and really large vents on the bottom.The build quality of this Acer is extremely good. Everything is solid.The only thing I was unable to do is use the Windows Hello Fingerprint or Face ID. I'm still working on it, so see why I can't get windows to recognize it. The camera works fine...just not recognized by Windows Hello.The Graphics Card is an Nvdia RTX 3060. Did I mention this computer is FAST? IT IS FAST. Highly Recommended.",0
"(there is a really good reason why): Lenovo Thinkpads cost more money... there is a really good reason why. THEY ARE BETTER and Worth the Extra pennies!! Super Fast, i myself appreciate the lenovo update tool, it even keeps the bios up to date! Very well made, solid device.",0
(Cheap don’t buy): I’ve had this computer for less than 6 months. I use it maybe an hour or two a day if that. The keyboard is fading and the shift keys feel like they are going to fall out. This laptop has a cheap feel. I’m unsure I’ll be able to see the keys in a few more months.,0
(Im pretty happy): The laptop was in excellent condition with great specs to boot. Plus it was hundreds of dollars less then what the dell website asked for it. 10/10 would buy again.,0
(Wouldn't recommend): Slow slow slow. Started freezing up after a week of using it.,0
"(Buena y Barata): Buena, potente y barata.",0
(Works great for work): Not HD so not the best video quality for watching shows & movies or gaming but works perfect for price,0
"(Excellent laptop for casual browsing, streaming and work): Set up and start up were simple and easy. The settings for adjusting the keyboard lights are very simple to understand and operate. The build quality is sturdy and robust. I am primarily using this computer for office work, browsing and streaming videos and this system does so quickly and with ease. Unlike what other reviewers have said, I do not notice any excessive noise with the fan, but the computer and charger does get warm when operating. I would absolutely recommend this computer if you're looking for a well-priced and fun machine!",0
"(Computer was good, except it was listed as new and I ...): Computer was good, except it was listed as new and I got a used one with someone else's email account still active on the desktop. Nice case.",0
(Worth the money. Your losing money if you don’t buy it.): This is a Real Review. If your looking for a laptop for basic stuff like homework for school such as myself. BUY IT. It’s reliable. Battery pretty decent.,0
"(Research chrome books): I liked the design of this laptop. It’s compact, lightweight, and clean.I didn’t really know what a chrome book was, but I’m not a fan. This computer would be great for someone who is already familiar with android or chrome book.",0
"(Converted from Apple and very satisfied): My daughter was begging for a Mac computer and now that she has this chromebook, she is so happy. It is sleek, lightweight and fully functional for her needs. She is thrilled with the ease of use and getting to know this operating system is a snap.",0
"(Great laptop for gaming!): This is the first laptop that i have bought for gaming in particular. Overall it runs great, preforms fantastic, and is very fast. It can run hot when you are playing games over a few hours but thankfully it comes with a built in turbo fan that helps cool it down. The fan is a bit loud but the built in Mic does a great job of not picking it up when communicating with those in your game. Overall i would by this laptop and or a computer made by MSI again!",0
"(Doesn't always use the correct graphics card for every game): Its OK for gaming. When it uses the right graphics card it works great, but there are some games I've noticed that are choppy and somehow its using a completely different graphics card. Not all games allow you to choose the graphics card you use in the settings. Extremely weird. Never seen anything like it.",0
"(Good computer, but rather heavy): I'm a Mac guy, but I needed a Windows machine with good graphics capabilities. This fits the bill. It's an excellent computer - fast and responsive, and with ample drive space, memory and ports. The primary negative is that it's heavy, and I need to use it as a laptop and travel with it. If it mostly sits on your desk or you just move it at home from one surface to another, then it works very well as a desktop substitute.",0
"(Not a complete Mac yet...): This is a very good computer. Very fast and works with most people.... but, some apps just don't work. They used to work in my other Macbook pro. but on this M1 it simple won't work.... apps like Google drive!!!! for good sake!Even worst... trying to return... 15% restocking fee.Serious Amazon?!",0
(nice chromebook): so far this seems to do the job I want it to--I don't game so mainly I just use it for a few purposes,0
"(la liviandad, pesa menos que un libro): Es una laptop muy placentera, delicada y plena en su funcionalidad. Su gran pantalla con una resolucion asombrosa, la rapidez con que se trabaja dado su plena memoria solida, lo amigable de su teclado, la exelencia de su procesador. odo es una maravilla y da enorme placer trabajar con ella.",0
(One Star): Returned. Was used and not G on the ad.,0
(Could have put necessary thing on it): Less than 2 hr batteryNo protection on it,0
"(Great starter Chromebook.): This device works excellently as a lite notebook with Google Doc integration. The battery life is good as well as screen quality. As a Chrome OS, it does not offer a great deal of Bluetooth devices. It integrates with my Smartphone and USB. It does not offer any touchscreen capability.",0
(kdlkDJlkJsdl): Worse PC ever. Pointer jumps all over the place. Did chat three times and nothing changed. PC just crashed on me and I only had it for 5 weeks.,0
"(Good laptop): Good laptop, fast delivery. Everything as I wanted. Thank you",0
(laptop): works great,0
"(Very good laptop for work): Great laptop for work. It could run most games on low or medium setting. The storage is limited, but it is usually not a problem for me even though I have many large files. The battery is around 7-8 hours if you keep it only medium brightness, and you are using the internet. It will last around 4 hours when gaming. It charges very fast and is as light as a MacBook. For the price, it is probably better. The graphics are nice, but the camera is not very good. However, for the price, it is probably he best work laptop you could get.",0
(Came with dead pixel): Dead pixel right out of the box,0
