Its RAM is great for most audio mixing and video animation and manipulation I've tried so far. My only dislike is how quickly the laptop heats up, which subsequently triggers the fans, which can be admittedly loud. This isn't really a surprise as the trade-off is entirely expected for such high performance especially with the GPU. The MSI Gaming Center app is very well designed in that it helps you optimize the performance as you need, also helping you keep an eye on CPU/GPU temperatures and overall system health.The screen quality is pretty good as well. Although, the chassis is a bit flimsy, almost feeling like I'm going to bend the screen everyone I open the laptop, but at a $1400 price tag it's decent when you factor in the performance aspects. I haven't used this laptop for much gaming, mostly content creation, but it provides some solid graphics resolution for animation.Battery life is surprisingly higher than you might expect from a gaming laptop, but it's still fairly quick to run out and may incur performance issues when unplugged. I can usually get about 2 hours of casual browsing with maybe some YouTube when unplugged, but I can definitely notice some performance lags in those cases.Overall, for the price and performance, this is a great deal and great product.

The last 3 Msi laptops were disappointing to say the least, defective when received and never repaired properly or were too fragile transporting to work and back, requiring constant maintenance and lasting 1 to 2 years before going out on me. So I was hoping ASUS could do better and wanted a 15.6 for my regular backpack. I was surprised that once I got the Win 11 OS configured right this little rig proved to be one of the best gaming laptops I ever bought. I have owned 6 or 7 over the years and this one impressed me with it's reliability and although it looks kind of frail, proved to be pretty rugged so far. The Fed ex box it came in was banged up and there was virtually no foam, or padding of any kind around the inner box with the laptop - I was really surprised the laptop was not damaged. It is very light as well, so it is easy on an old back, but it will run almost any of my games maxed out and I can game with it in my lap without the fans burning me.

Asus only designates one ROG Strix SCAR each year and this one deserves the title.I got three of these, one for myself and one for each of my gamer girls. Yeah, it's a big Christmas. I'll update as time goes on as I will have the experiences of three users.Right now, I can say off the top of my head that if you're a power user, you can bypass the IGPU (integrated Radeon) using the USB-C 3.1 port in the back of the laptop. I got a USB-C to DP adapter and 4k graphics pour out fast directly from the DGPU (the Nvidia RTX 3080).I am also getting a USB-C hub to use as a docking station and also to read SD Cards. Yeah, the laptop doesn't have a card reader. It doesn't have a cam either. My heart is broken and bleeds peanut butter.You can find many, many USB videos about this stuff. Some of them get a little hyper about the 15 inch display being connected to the IGPU. Well, it's true. I used to think this was bad like many of the YouTubers. But there's no bottleneck that I can detect so I have to trust Asus knew what they were doing when they decided to architect it this way.Technically, routing the graphics from the DGPU to the IGPU to the laptop display is a little bit slower, but not in any noticeable way to me so far. And there's always using the back USB port to bypass the IGPU entirely.Also, we've been playing with the Oculus Quest 2 (or Meta Quest or whatever). So far it seems to be happier working directly off of the DGPU but I've heard there's a workaround for it to work off of the IGPU.UPDATE: 60 DaysSo I've had this machine for a little over 2 months and I'm still very happy with it. There's only one real problem that I found and it is with the Meta Quest VR. I don't know if this is a bug on the Asus side of things or if it lies with the Oculus App. The video signal seems to go to the headset either via Wi-Fi or direct USB cable link. That's called the Oculus Link and Air Link. For some reason the app wants to process that video with the integrated GPU which just doesn't work. You either get a black screen or just three dots waiting. There's an inelegant solution which is to simply go into the device manager of Windows and disable the integrated GPU. That will allow Air Link and Oculus Link to work because then they are able to use the dedicated GPU. That might make a couple of other things go wonky for you so be sure to enable the integrated GPU when you're done with PCVR.Right now the official story from Oculus is that it's all in beta anyway and that's great if you can get it to work but it's not officially supported yet. So this may all be a non-issue once it gets out of beta. Also, there's another solution called the Virtual Desktop which will allow PCVR to work. That is a separate paid app that you can get from the Oculus store. It streams the video to the headset independently of the Oculus link and Air Link. So that is a completely different way to do PCVR with the Quest. It's also not officially supported but seems to work great for lots of people.So that's just really one application (PCVR) that I've had an issue with. And I think it's a problem that will be solved once it's out of beta and they are able to make it use the dedicated GPU.Otherwise this laptop has been amazeballs and I still highly recommend it.Amazeballs.UPDATE: 1 YEAR LATERI am still loving this laptop. All the Meta Quest 2 (Oculus) issues have been resolved by Meta.

Some of the shortcomings have the option to be upgraded after you buy it, thanks to an open RAM slot, easily accessible M.2 drive and a space for a 2.5\" Sata SSD or HDD. Unlike a lot of laptops coming out these days, Acer is not hostile towards repairs or upgrades to the machine. This is awesome and I wish that it was the status quo for laptop manufacturers.This computer is equipped with the newest 11th generation Intel Core i3 processor, it's only a dual core CPU but it's still a fast one. Single core performance is as good as the older Core i7 in my main laptop, Multicore performance is lower considering that it only has 2 cores. It's still plenty capable for most things. It has the newer Xe graphics architecture, but with only 48 Execution Units. This is about half of what you would get with an i7, and I think that's why it is still considered \"Intel UHD\" graphics. Some gaming is possible, performance should be better than the previous generation Ice Lake chips. But I still don't think it will yield enough of an improvement for me to recommend this specifically for gaming. 4GB of ram is about the smallest amount that you can get away with to run Windows 10. I would urge you to spend $30 on a 4GB stick after you buy this, to have a total of 8GB because that will give you a better experience and it's cheaper than buying a more expensive model from Acer. The 128GB SSD is made by Samsung in the model that I received, it was speedy and allows the computer to boot up fast and make Windows updates go a lot quicker. If that is not enough space, you could easily add more after you buy the computer. You will always save money by performing upgrades yourself, compared to buying models with more RAM and storage (which is why many brands don't give you the option to do this).You get an excellent selection of ports on this laptop- 3x USB A ports, 1x USB C port, HDMI, Ethernet, headphone jack. 3 of the USB ports support the 3.2 gen 1 speed of 5 Gigabits for data transfer. Charging is restricted to the proprietary barrel plug that the adapter comes with. So no USB C charging, and no video out over that port, either. This isn't that big of a deal since you do have the HDMI port on board.Moving on to the build quality- this is where the news is not so good. The lid is actually aluminum, but the rest of the laptop is basically all plastic. There is a bit of flex to the keyboard deck and you will have to be more careful with this laptop than you would with an all metal design. It's not like this thing is gonna fall apart on you or anything, but it's my job to point out the product's shortcomings. The screen is another place where I feel like Acer cheaped out, the colors are just faded and washed out looking. It also has bad vertical viewing angles, if you tilt the display too far back or forward, it looks like a fog is forming between you and the screen. It has bad coverage of the sRGB color space (only about 55%). This is part of why the colors don't look vibrant at all.The keyboard is good, it's not great but it should work well enough for most people. It's not backlit, but at least the keys are black with white letters, it should help for seeing them in low light. The trackpad is a little worse, for one thing, it's off center and it messes with your muscle memory if you are used to using centered ones. It's also cheap plastic and you feel the resistance when you are moving your fingers over the surface. I would just end up using a mouse if I was gonna be using this laptop regularly.I think that this is an ok purchase for the money, but I would urge you to be ready to open the bottom panel in order to add more RAM and possibly storage to get the most out of this machine. And keep in mind that the screen is not super nice to look at. Any Windows 10 laptop at this price is gonna have some flaws, this one is one of the better options available, considering it lets you fix some of the problems after you buy it.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

The system is quiet, VR capable, and an excellent portable gaming system.I don't have any major complaints about the laptop. My only issues are nitpicky at best.BENCHMARKS:- Hitman at 1080p all settings maxed using the Dual GPU setting and DX12: Average 57fps- Ashes of the Singularity on Crazy preset at 1080p DX11: Average 32fps- Rise of the Tomb Raider at 1080p Very High preset DX12: Average 58fpsWHAT I LIKE:The system peaked at 50db of fan noise during benchmarking. To put that in perspective, that\u2019s only ~5db higher than one of our normal gaming desktops idling.We tested with virtual reality (VR), and the test was successful. We played Skyrim VR, Superhot VR, and Space Pirate Trainer without any lagging or motion sickness on an HTC Vive. This system is impressively small for its VR form factor.Surprisingly pleasant keyboard, the keys have more travel than the latest MacBook Pros. Gaming feels natural on the keyboard, and I saw no reason to use an external one. The backlighting is well done and can be toggled off if desired.The screen is gorgeous; matte 1080p looks very clean. Colors are vividly reproduced, and the screen is extremely bright.The spinning disk in the system performed admirably; I didn\u2019t observe any significant load times in games installed to it. The NVMe drive also runs very quickly, faster than standard SATA SSDs. (see screenshot).I like the overall body of the system, it feels very pleasant to hold and looks quite striking.WHAT COULD BE BETTER:Unfortunately, there was some Lenovo crapware which I had to remove. The junk was both Windows 10 apps as well as standard programs.The NumPad isn\u2019t laid out like full keyboard. The top line of numbers is higher than normal, and the math signs are on the right instead of the top. This sacrifice was made to keep a full set of arrow keys, which gamers will appreciate.I had some difficulty getting updated drivers for the GPU. I tried both the mobile and desktop GPU drivers, but neither one thought the system was compatible. Eventually, I had to download GeForce Experience which found and installed the drivers with no hassle.The system is heavy as you might expect with gaming laptops. This is not your lightweight, business-class laptop!The rubber strips on the bottom of the system which protrude a half-centimeter from the bottom of the laptop. I found these strips would get caught on the inside of my backpack.CONCLUSION: I used to unplug and move my bulky, gaming desktop computer to a friend's house when we were going to game all night. Now I take this Lenovo laptop laptop with me, and it's way easier to transport.

Samsung did a GREAT job with this.The only drawbacks in my opinion is that the battery life is not great. It is much better compared to a traditional windows laptop, however, I used to have ASUS chromebook that would stay charged for weeks when idle and like 10 hours when I was using it. My experience with this chromebook is maybe 4-6 horus. The bigger issue is that the battery discharges quickly when not in use. I'd be okay with it if once you started using it you only had 4-6 hours, but it is a bit annoying to charge it up, wait a few days, and find that it down to 20%. I would ask that SAMSUNG addresses this...maybe its a software thing burning up battery in the background?Otherwise great machine.

This one has been pretty good so far. Handles everything I need professionally and everything I want for fun. As a gamer and designer, this gets it done.UPDATE - It was fun while it lasted. Stars have been reduced but only due to some nonsense. I bought this computer on 6/1/2020. Today is 2/28/21 and marks just at 8 months.Yesterday, one of the fans completely failed - with a very noisy and dramatic exit. Shortly after, the PC began to get very hot. I can't use it for work now. I can't (shouldn't) use it at all. It's loud and sounds like it is about to blow up.Reached out to the seller, and the seller recommended that I reach out to Acer - since it is still under factory warranty. That's not a good start. Acer has not responded yet and I do not have an Acer repair center in my state anyway, so it looks like I will be without this PC for several weeks either way.Not the best time for such an inconvenience. I have to order another computer to ensure I can still get my work done. NOT COOL! Essentially, a costly situation using money I was not prepared to spend. That's why I bought this unit - hoping I wouldn't run into such situations. But, I guess I'll end up with TWO expensive computers for the lesson. What was the lesson? Well, I should have gone with my first choice.If you look on the web, you'll find NUMEROUS forums talking about this unit's fan issues. I rolled the dice and lost. DO YOUR RESEARCH and have a backup if you take this road. I'll update you again and let you know whether I was taken care of by Acer.UPDATE 3/15/21 - The laptop returns after about two weeks - but not per the instructions that I had provided. It was sent to the wrong address and I needed to go chase it down. NOT COOL! It also came back with a few more scratches than I was prepared to see and the repair notes were vague at best. However, it does sound better and the fan seems to be working. Considering that I had to buy another laptop, I suppose this one will make a good gift.

I initially did not want to purchase another ASUS as the customer service I received on my last was very shoddy. However, the specs and aesthetics of this model had me coming back. I've been in the market for a slim, light-weight, gaming laptop that was reliable and did not look like red, flaming school bus. This laptop hit the mark right on the money. It fits inside any bag and looks just like a macbook. It is a little more plasticy than a macintosh, but still feels sturdy. I like the addition of the numpad as I work with numbers and spreadsheets on a daily basis.The speakers (harman/kardon) are the best I've ever heard on a laptop. I can comfortably watch movies and YouTube videos at home without headphones. Spotify tracks also come through very clear.The laptop does not have a long battery life, but the charge time is surprisingly fast. I haven't timed it, but I'm able to plug it back in and have it fully charged without me even realizing it.I've played GTA V and Left 4 Dead 2 on highest quality so far and they both get a consistent 60 FPS without much heat. Fan noise isn't very loud, especially with the nice speakers. I'll probably update this review when I try some more demanding games out.The track pad can get a little jumpy at times, maybe for a couple minutes. I'm not sure what the cause of it is, but it's only a slight annoyance. It's pretty smooth and responsive the other 98% of the time.The screen is kind of lackluster. As others have said, the viewing angles are pretty narrow, but I honestly don't mind it too much. I've played around with MacBooks before and can say they're much better, but just about everything else on this laptop makes up for it.I'm pretty happy with my purchase, can't really suggest any changes about the laptop. After living with the last laptop for 5 years and all of its small annoyances, I'm very satisfied with the upgrade. I only recently graduated from college, but can say I would have loved to have this for taking to class or the library.

A chromebook appealed to me because a lot of the work I do is linked through Google. I spent a decent amount of time researching, and I am sorry to say that I pegged this one wrong.For starters the battery life is absolutely atrocious. I gave it a full charge right out of the box without ever turning it on, just like it says in the manual, and used it maybe twice. The big issue wasn't the amount of battery life while using it per say, but I learned that when you power it off, it doesn't truly shut off. It concerned me at first when I noticed that it turns on right away every single time you open the lid. It doesn't power off, it hibernates. So you are draining battery life even when it is sitting on your shelf \"powered off\".If that wasn't bad enough, even if you change it in the power settings to not sleep when the lid is closed, you cannot control when the screen shuts off. If the screen shuts off, yes, you guessed it, it hibernates again.... Really terrible if you are, I don't know, say, in the middle of uploading some pictures from an SD card, and are not constantly hovering around the device to keep hitting a key or moving the track pad to keep the screen on.On that note, the device is really really really slow. I am a huge fan of samsung products, but this one is just terrible. My Galaxy S7 is faster than this thing is. That's pretty despicable.In terms of the physical device itself. I should have thought to get a backlit keyboard. O boy was that dumb of me. And speaking of keyboards, it looks like they crammed in as much as they could into such a small space and went: \"What do you think people will use the most?\" and then cut those keys. Besides your basic ASDF and 1-9 keys there is nothing else really on the keyboard. And the Caps Lock is replaced by a search key. Don't think I needed it, but then again, I didn't do as good of a job researching this time around.Do yourself a favor and spend slightly more money for something good.", "output": "0"}, {"instruction": "Given a computer purchase review data from an e-commerce platform, determine whether the review data contains new requirements.

For those of us who have trained on using the touchpad, we want to be able to use it with your thumb, while keeping our palms and fingers in typing position. On my previous laptop, it was only 3/8\". I'm still able to work the pad, so I'm not subtracting from the stars, but if you have smaller hands, you might want to check this, if you want to use it this way.

Honestly speaking this device does have its own issues but most of them can be solved permanently or temporarily with fixes and workarounds. If you spend the time and tweak/tune it, its well worth the effort.Pros:- Very good and stable performance. 6 hours of gaming with no visible fps degradation. You need to put in another stick for dual channel though.- Chassis quality and hinges. It gives a premium feel overall. Very dense materials cause it to be much heavier than it looks. Solid and compact.- Nice panel, most units come with an AUO that has many calibration files over internet that u can apply but mine came with a similar quality LG panel. Unfortunately isnt as colour accurate out of the box. Still looks gorgeous in games, however.- Good keyboard if you can live with the gamer-y looks.Cons:- Asus bloatware. It hijacks your Windows Powerplan and causes kb rgb issues in some modes.- Some coil whine and backlight bleeding. But this is up to your luck and can happen with any other laptop as well.Other thoughts:- 2060 sku is much cooler than 2070. Mine hovers around mid/low 70s for both processors on average while running Witcher 3. Maybe low 80s on cpu for more intense games like BF 5. But many people complain about thermals in 704gw.- Myasus app allows you to change the battery charging profile. This can help with yor battery lifespan. Only useful software that comes with the laptop.- Amazon promotion isnt valid if you're not a US resident. Kind of a bummer but no big deal.Overall I'm happy with its performance.
