I was using it for 3 month mostly for work (matlab and 3D rendering).
I am excited to use this for video production as well and imaging stuff very soon!
"I bought this laptop as a student who wanted a powerful gaming machine for on the go during train commutes, but also something sleek and clean for classroom work."
got this thing because I needed a windows laptop for some unity development and the macbook pro/imac I have won't cut it.
I was kinda shocked to see that housed the power supply and then a much more sleek box that had the laptop inside.
This laptop is great for school and work.
it came with an offer for a free headset (Steelseries Siberia 200) for leaving a review
you can easily decrease cpu temperatures without decreasing performance by undervolting
I received NONE of these items when I received the unit from Amazon!
The MSI customer service is extremely disinterested
I need a laptop sleek enough to carry to the office and power enough to enjoy some games.
I only wish they would do better QC control to catch this sort of thing at the factory.
"this particular version must not be the ""Special Edition"" and as such does not come in the huge wooden box, or, more disappointingly, the nice suede laptop sleeve."
"I didn't want something huge and bulky like Alienware, and was afraid to get a brand from a less reputable manufacturer."
I know this is a gaming laptop but I actually bought it for school and it might sounds overkill but this laptop is perfect for schoo
I purchased this coming from a daily Surface Pro 3 user because I wanted something a bit more powerful for work and play.
MSI support is useless and didn't help or force them to drive many hours away to the nearest physical support center.
"I bought this laptop to use at school, so that I could study as well as play games such as Far Cry 5 or Counter Strike."
MSI's customer support is a joke too. I submitted several tickets with little to no effect.
The packaging was very thorough and included a rather large microfiber cloth and ensured the laptop made it without any issues.
"I consider myself a light gamer, playing simulation/ world building/management games like Cities Skylines, Tropico 5, Sims 4/3, Project Highrise & this computer takes everything you throw at it."
If you need this computer to last you a few years then keep it cool!
did not come in its hard wooden case and with the laptop sleeve.
I have purchased multiple laptops and this has to be my favorite one so far.
Is for my son who.is doing gaming and using it for his media class projects
"I've owned this laptop for almost exactly a year now, and it has served me very well."
I am an Engineering student who uses very needy software and plays games often
MSI will always have your back when it comes to their customers and products.
i sent a laptop in for a mouse issue and it came back and it kept having other hardware issues and I returned it.
This is great for work and relaxing with my latest game.
"I was looking for something light, small, and can handle anything I throw at it, while looking professional when doing it"
The warranty was only for 12 months so MSI would not cover the replacement of a part that was obviously defective.
It arrived very quickly and came packaged in a beautiful black box with the msi logo in gold.
it does not come with the limited white box
"does not qualify for the ""Intel Creator Software Pack"""
"It arrived beautifully packed, and felt incredibly good to hold."
I had received the laptop delivery 3 days earlier than the estimated delivery date.
I requested a change and the msi support service was horrible the whole time.
The shipping was fast arrive a day faster
I asked them to replace it and they were going to take it away for 2 months while I was in school.
They have the ABSOLUTE worst customer service.
"Instead of admitting they are knowingly selling bad harddrives, they argue about they can't help hard drive failure."
the packaging was very nice
The laptop came in a nice sleek box and a nice fabric sleeve.
"I received an RMA number, but was told it itll be 3-5 business days before they unbox it, and another 10-30 business days for in-house turn around time."
"Although I paid for a an over night shipping, this unit came in much later than then what when it's supposed to be delivered."
I was able to receive the codes after two days of receiving the machine.
"This computer shipped really fast, it came a day late but amazon took care of that."
I called MSI technical support (not amazon) and they gave me steps to get it to work. Which were basically what I had done on my own
I had a very positive experience with technical support even though they weren't able to solve the problem remotely.
it was safely packaged with bubble wrap and was very neat which was a great
"The way the replacement unit behaved, makes it a likely and very uncomfortable possibility."
I had a problem with the shipping as they sent the wrong product
"Prime 2-day delivery, triple boxed for protection, nicely packaged from MSI"
"Talked to MSI customer support, they told me to flash the bios. Did that. Same problems persist."
"I emailed customer service and after initial info requests, there was no further response and it has been two weeks."
Received a good QC product from Amazon.
My customer service experience soely with Razer was terrible.
It showed up in pristine condition with no damages to the package as I would expect.
This has been a truly awful customer service experience and Iâ€™ll be going elsewhere for my gaming devices from now on.
"I tried to contact them 2 times by phone, 3 times trough chat and 7 times trough e-mail and no acknowledge of a problem, estimate on when my laptop will be sent back or anything else."
I've tried to talk with Razer rep but they just seem to be buying time for my 30day replacement period to end
Product repair center is SLOW.
"Chat support will put you on hold for ""2-3 minutes"" (but it's actually much longer) and then it AUTOMATICALLY DISCONNECTS you if you haven't typed in anything for 5 minutes."
"I was impressed with the shipping packaging, as it allowed the laptop to arrive undamaged even after getting the box deeply gouged and dented."
"they delayed my shipping two times despite me trying reschedule it and paying for 1 day shipping, although it did come one earlier then the changed date."
I had to send the computer in to ASUS and they had to replace the harddrive. They did not update the warranty from time of repair.
I called tech support for ASUS and they could not help.
The packaging was very professional and neat.
i am happy with fast delivery.. i choose 5-8 buissnes days for free shiping and it arive in 4 days
A technician at Asus damaged my notebook and they are blaming it on me.
They responds with their generic emails and never answer my question or help me.
I needed a replacement and customer service was just as terrible trying to scam me taking about $600.
It eventually failed after 3 weeks of use but Asus with their awesome customer service provided me with a full refund.
The box packaging etc is nice and thick.
"A human being, that speaks my language, answered my call in less than 5 minutes and was very knowledgeable and understood what I was dealing with."
they give you an Amazon gift card for the cost of the laptop
HP even ships it in a very nice box.
The box this one comes in makes it look like a present.
The box was already open and it looks like someone used it.
it would be nice if the screen could fold back or rotate so it could be used more like a tablet
"it arrives in a sleek, black box with a beautiful photo of the laptop on its cover"
"when i first opened the box, you get 2 extra goodies- a carrying sleeve and an optical mouse!"
If this would have the correct dwscription I would have given five stars.
they should remove the numberpad functionality description on this item
I hate to call computer customer service - they never give you a straight answer but they make you do one hundred unnecessary things.
Customer service was great
"Customer Service is to be commended , they immediately reached out to me via email to notify me of their free offer of a laptop bag."
I received the laptop bag in very short time and it is a great addition for the laptop.
I received the laptop very quickly.
A very kind guy who answered many questions I had
Great customer service The guy helped me to decide which other chuwi product can I get for me
Chuwi did not respond to opened online support case.
Sent wrong power set up
When we received the laptop the mousepad was cracked.
mine arrived quickly and in fine shape
Product arrived damaged directly out of the box.
Completely disappointed in both the product and the customer service available from Amazon and Samsung.
The laptop was well packaged
I contacted Razer for the extended warranty and they refuse to give it to me unless I live in the USA
"CAME WITH ZERO , NONE INSTRIICTIONS CAME WITH PC."
The device arrived faster than quoted packaged excellently
I also received a gift card from them
"Received the order in a timely manner, the packaging for the product looked elegant and well-thought out"
I am thankful that Xidu is sending me a mouse because I am terrible with pads.
It took an hour of being on the phone with Tech support for them to connect to my pc and find out that it was a corrupt driver that was sold to me and basically made my computer break for a while.
this was a very fast delivery
I got a huge discount on this product on Prime Day.
"Customer Service is to be commended , they immediately reached out to me via email to notify me of their free offer of a laptop bag."
"Some of the reviews mention the touch screen, which this one does not have"
"The charger that came with it, has a EURO style plug, which is basically useless in the US"
I purchased this laptop because I was looking for something affordable to get work done on and to watch some videos through YouTube and Netflix.
"The most I would use this laptop for is web browsing, office work, and basic coding (preferably with google colab)"
I don't think anything like video or photo editing or machine learning should be attempted on this.
"This is a toy, and not even a good one at that"
I received the laptop very quickly. three business days to Peru
"A very kind guy who answered many questions I had, even technical."
He offered and sent me the bag for the laptop.
"I bougt this laptop thinking in my daughter school homeworks, downloading and playing music and watching internet videos."
The days i have the laptop I have used it in order to decide if I bought another one for my other child.
"I have watched netflix, youtube and my own videos from my full HD camera and there is no problem."
IT IS MORE THAN CAPABLE OF MOST OF YOUR DAILY ACTVITIES WITH OUT THE USUAL BLOAT IN TODAY'S LOWER PRICED OFFERINGS.
I recommend 10/10 if you're looking for a quality look that's powerful then this laptop is for you.
a great buy for someone looking for a great all around laptop.
"To be perfectly honest, the only reason I'm writing this review is because the laptop came with a ""Review & Receive - MSI Gaming Headset"" card packaged within the box."
"I bought this laptop because I wanted to experience gaming at its fullest, and this laptop sure does deliver"
if you're looking for a high standard of quality and portability then this laptop is the way to go!
I have to say that I bought this laptop for gaming and trave
Bought this laptop for gaming and video editing and it runs both like a champ
It says there 16gb *1 which means there should be only 1 stick but there is two sticks of 8gb rams.
"I think that's highly misleading if it ships with 2x8GB, which is how mine arrived."
good luck getting support from MSI their customer service is almost impossible to get a hold of
I bought this laptop because it looks professional
I bought it for editing videos and playing Fortnit
When I received my laptop the seal on the box was cut
"Use it for just browsing the web, researching, that sort of thing."
Only had this for a few hours since it was a gift for someone and I wanted to make sure it worked.
I'm currently using it for video editing and gaming video capture for my Youtube channel and so far so good.
It arrived ok but there were signs of previous usage on the computer.
Bought for a friend
I use for work and play
I needed something a bit more powerful though
So I received my AeroBook yesterday from a crowd funding campaign.
The 3Stars because it was delivery to the wrong hous for a a day an its only been an hour for me to check it out
Bought it because I need a tablet for travel purposes
I have been in search for a Windows tablet.
"So I got this laptop because I love MSI, and I really wanted a laptop that would last me more than a year (I have really bad luck with computers)"
