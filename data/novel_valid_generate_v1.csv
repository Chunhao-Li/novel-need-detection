Case is normal as budget price. Screen is big and the display colour is a bit light. System is smooth and runs most of the Android apps perfectly. Battery life is enough for more than 8hours heavy usage. I would strongly recommend this Chromebook for light works and entertainment.,0
Excelent.,0
Working good,0
I bought this laptop for my brother 4 years ago. He is still using it without any problem. You know how teens don't take care of their stuff? Yes and this laptop survives all that! Not a single problem and runs new games too. Definitely worth the price.,0
"I bought this model elsewhere for $169.99 and I'm very happy with it after one day. I have an Asus Chromebook with a Core i3 and 6 GB of RAM along with an HP Chromebook 14 with a quad core Nvidia but with only 2GB of RAM. This model has 4 GB and a low end dual core Celeron, which is fine because I want the Android apps that will come with it. So far, I'm happy with the speed and performance of it. Can't beat the price.Update: 6/17/2017: Android apps is currently in the Beta channel for this model.Update: Android apps came on in ""Stable channel"" on 11/15/2017. It works great so far. It's easy to go from Chrome OS browser to Android apps and back again. Very happy with it.",0
the battery life isn’t that great,0
This is exactly what I need and nothing more. Perfect for my needs...,0
"This is a great little laptop. I used it primarily for writing and data entry on the bus. It's the perfect size for working on a lapdesk with no elbow room. The battery lasted, the system ran smooth, it was great. The screen does tend to develop a few bright spots.After the pandemic hit and I was no longer on the bus, I gave it to my mom. It's an ideal laptop for less tech-savvy folks that just want to browse the web, comment on political articles, like awkward Facebook photos, or watch Netflix in bed even though they couldn't get the remote to work.",0
Needed a better gaming laptop (cannot afford a full PC) this thing runs smooth download speed is prime. I can play almost any game with no issues (haven't had any yet). Really really good for your money. 10/10 would recommend.,0
Great laptop for work and gaming fans are loud though and I average around 80-90 FPS in warzone,0
"Great product, overall!",0
terrible design. Speakers are under the keyboard. I can't figure that design out. It's like putting headlights underneath a car.,0
"This computer for this price was a complete steal - it works very, very well, and I absolutely love it!",0
"I always use my hp laptop. I hope I can use it for a long time this time, too.",0
"My first ever chrome book (have always used a PC prior to this), and bought it because the technical details indicated that this unit contained a 128 GB SSD drive - which it does not! Very disappointed that technical details are misleading.",0
"nice laptop, everthing is great, butf the touchpad can't not use at all. talked to asus and end up with return it. wish the one i got with no issues,because i like this laptop a lot , and also this laptop out of stock now , I am not able to replace it. feeling sad.",0
Works great. Easy to use.,0
Feel like a bottle neck but works great. Took some time to open it up and will be a process to upgrade but definitely is worth the price I received it for.,0
"I bought this in 2017 for my mom, I have a similar Acer of the same price, the difference is the SSD. I wanted more space, so I decided to just get a regular hard drive, monumental mistake. It runs at about 10% the speed as my other Acer, which once again is the same price, I still use and love. Also, it is 2020 now and as technology advances, things become outdated quickly. That's not to say the previous technology is bad, it's just that the new ones tend to be better and with identical pricing or cheaper. If you're looking for a laptop without breaking the bank let me save you a lot of time and recommend one. I have built quite a few PCs and am pursuing a master's in data science, so I know a bit about computers. Check out the HP 15-dy1036nr, its specifications are nothing short of phenomenal for the price of $599.99. Granted I haven't bought or used it, I'm purely speaking from a hardware standpoint, it comes with 8 GB DDR4-2666 SDRAM, Intel® Core i5-1035G1 which benchmarks twice as well as the CPU on this Acer, and 256 GB PCIe® NVMe M.2 SSD which by the way are the newer SSD's that read/write at 7 times the previous generation SSD's which were already blazing fast to begin with. The laptop has two downsides, it does not come with an optical drive, which is outdated but still could prove to be an inconvenience at one point, however, it's unlikely that'll you ever need it. The second downside is that the laptop comes with a virus by the name of McAfee, uninstall it as soon as you get it. If you need an antivirus, I recommend Malwarebytes, you can get a two-week trial on the premium version to test it, I had premium for around five years, but honestly, the free version should be more than enough.Also, if you're looking for a powerful computer and don't need the mobility of a laptop just build it yourself, you can build one for half the price you would get from a brand such as Alienware. It is also a neat and fun skill to have, watch a couple of YouTube videos, or read some articles to learn how. It really is not difficult; I can build one in about 20 minutes.I acknowledge that this review probably contains the use of poor grammar or incorrect punctuation. I have avoided English classes like the plague my whole life, with that being said it’s probably not the greatest analogy since it seems that people don't avoid the plague at all considering my experiences with Covid.-September 2020",0
"utilizo para arquitectura y diseño 3d con programas como 3dsmax, sketchup, autocad, vray con un rendimiento optimo incluso superando a mi pc de escritorio, de porte elegante y pequeño en comparacion a mi anterior rog, bastante liviana y facil de transportar, en turbo es un poco ruidosa pero no se calienta mucho que es algo que destacar en un diseño tan fino.. bastante recomendable",0
After a windows update the touch screen stopped working. The seller directed me to the manufacturer to look for a fix. The manufacturer gave me 5 possible solutions but none have worked. Turns out this is a common issue with this laptop.,0
"When I got it a single pixel was red (and still is), drives me crazy but circumstances meant I couldn't return it when it arrived.The weight to casing strength is horrible, the plastic casing is cracked is several spots just from the laptop being picked up. I have never dropped it, and never dropped anything onto it. At least one plastic piece is inside the computer, casing broke and it fell in, I can hear it shaking around.But the performance is good, and so is the battery life (when you aren't running a game)",0
Nice item...,0
"Lenovo Computer ReviewI’m no IT guru, so this is a total non-techy user review. I’ve owned and used this laptop computer September of 2021, and I love it! It was well past time for an upgrade, and I spent a lot of time looking at laptops, trying to decide what fit my needs and wants best. I narrowed it down to a few from Asus, Dell, Acer, and Lenovo. Even though this is marketed as a gaming laptop, it’s important to note that I am not a computer guru, nor am I a gamer. I don’t own a single game, so I can’t review it from that standpoint. I simply wanted a computer for everyday computing and web surfing, managing my music collection, editing photos, and running my telescopes (astronomy is one of my hobbies.)For my purposes, this computer is fast! It boots up in just a few seconds. The graphics are great! Being able to change the keyboard backlighting color is a great feature for me. Astronomy is a hobby of mine, so my keyboard lighting is red, since I don’t want bright light sources ruining my dark-adapted night vision when I'm using the laptop with my telescopes at night.No computer is perfect, and I do have a few minor nit-picks with this one, though there are none that I find unacceptable. First, this computer came with ABSOLUTELY NO DOCUMENTATION! No manual, printed or otherwise. Not even a quick-start guide. No CD with a manual or utilities. All you get in the box is the laptop and the power cord/AC adapter. In spite of the lack of documentation, it was pretty easy for me to power it up and start using it. Next, the AC adapter is very bulky, compared to the ones that come with most other laptops. It’s about 6”x 3”x 1”, it’s heavy for its size, and it’s situated in the middle of the power cord. I will say that the power cord is quite long, which is good. The power cord plugs into the back of the unit, rather than on the side. There’s only one USB port on right side of the computer, and there’s a USB-C port and a headphone jack on the left side. I would have preferred two side USB ports, but there are three more on the back of the unit, along with a HDMI port, another USB-C port, and a LAN connection. There’s plenty of connectability, if you don’t mind most of it being on the back of the unit. The speakers sound like typical laptop speakers, and I think it’s silly to expect much more than that. I use headphones, Bluetooth speakers, or I just Bluetooth my music from the laptop to my home stereo system. Last, the battery doesn’t last long as long as I’d like, but that’s to be expected from a computer with the high-end processing and graphics capability this computer has. For every day, non-gaming use, I get about two-and-a-half to three hours of use from the battery before I need to recharge it. If you need portability power, you’d do well to use all of the power saving settings, have an alternate power supply to plug into, or an extra battery, or consider another computer altogether. Again, none of these are things that cause me any real issues, but they might for others. In spite of them all, I do love this machine!One of the things about this computer that was a big selling point for me is that it was sold directly by Amazon, rather than a third-party vendor on Amazon. I hear a lot of hard luck stories from folks who bought computers from third-party vendors who had a tough time either getting warranty service for computers with problems, or returning them for refunds. And a lot of computers offered by third-party vendors have been modified by those vendors. I read a lot of reviews from customers of a lot of those units, complaining of inferior parts being used for the mods. Luckily for me, I had no desire to return my computer, nor have I had any functionality issues with it. But when I have had to return anything to Amazon, it’s always been a no-hassle experience for me. And to top it off, the Amazon price on this computer was less than that offered directly from Lenovo.What I like:Looks great!It’s fast! Boots up in only a few seconds.Graphics are top notch.WIFI and Bluetooth work wellKeyboard backlighting colors are changeable (red is my preference)10-key pad on keyboard (I use this a lot!)Sold directly by Amazon (at least it was when I bought mine)What I don’t like:NO documentationThe battery could last longerMost of the connectivity ports are on the back of the computerBulky AC adapterAnnoying occasional sales nags from McAfee and Microsoft. Fairly easily removed.",0
it works really fast and provides great pictures,0
"while I like asus etc, we found this only had 28G space of which windows itself took 15G. we were unable to run any programs due to this lack of spaceI dont fault anyone but these days a 256G is small since programs require so much space, so I;m baffled at this tiny driveBut if you have no need for it, its fine",0
"I really dislike this computer. Little memory, can't load small games. Unfixable errors and explanations of ways to fix it does not offer much help. The mouse port and power cord ports both broke. Never again.",0
The laptop comes with Windows 10 instead of Windows 11 as advertised. Seller refuses to accept responsibility for false advertising,0
"I loved it! I'm using it for Video editing, Auto cad, Photoshop, playing online games, watching UHD movies and internet browsing!For me it's fast! and the shipping as well! didn't expected it to be so fast. Well packaged, it came to me safe and sound!Overall, I'm so happy with it and the service! Thanks so much!",0
Ordered this for my kids to do learning games and websites on it. So far on PBS kids website it is working out perfect. Some people complain about the screen but I think its great for the kids. I kinda want one for myself to download games from google on it lol. For the price you can't beat it. I was originally wanting to get them a desktop (ages 5 &7) but came across this affordable laptop and couldn't pass it up. They are really loving it and it goes super fast! We aren't planning to add anything to it.. Only for educational purposes only :),0
Very happy with the purchase,0
"Very good! It came 3 days early, its fast. It downloaded all of my games in only 10 mins! I was on a 1000 budget and looked around forever until I found this beauty. The only bad thing I have found so far is the fact of the battery, it doesn't last that long but it is average. Still, if you want a fast and amazing computer get this one.",0
"So far, so good. I absolutely love it. It's compact without being too small, screen resolution is great, and the volume of the speakers is nice. Very efficient and the price was wonderful.",0
There is also a small pin light near the power button that seems to be aimed right in my eyes when the laptop is on,0
This is my first computer and I love it,0
Not what I expected.,0
I had the 2018 version of this laptop and i was skeptical on buying this version because the 2018 version had some awful thermals. After reading some reviews i decided to just go for it and it was totally worth it. This thing barely goes over 80 degrees and runs everything i play at high settings. Its a bit loud but at least it stays cool. The keyboard is great and the overall laptop looks and feels amazing. Highly recommend!,0
"It arrived faster than was projected. I opened the box, checked for imperfections , then plugged it in. It worked. I will report further when I have used it some more.",0
Fantastic build quality with a clean CNC Aluminium structure and finish.,0
This computer is not worth the money. The touch pad is horrible to deal with when trying to use. The keyboard is not at good quality.,0
"it’s a pretty good pc for gaming, i highly recommend it.",0
"If I could go back and not buy this laptop, I would. It’s fine for word processing and web browsing, but it is enormous and not good for transporting. The screen quality and color is mediocre at best. When the pandemic hit, I needed it for zoom calls and it was all we had for my son and daughter’s digital schooling—it can’t handle it. The constant messages of “your cpu is effecting the meeting” and other messages is frustrating.My son was issued a small, Dell chrome book from his school this year and it is far better than this Acer. Ugh—I wish I could afford another laptop.",0
"At first glance this seems like a great laptop with decent specs, and the price is attractive. However, once I used it for a few days the corners that asus cut to make this price possible emerged. The housing of the laptop is very thin aluminum, this allows the heat from the processor and graphics card to dissappate without using a built in fan. This causes the laptop to overheat and the bottom becomes so hot it can't be placed on one's lap. Probably as a result of the heat, the battery started to deteriorate and after just 2 weeks it wasn't holding a proper charge, I was forced to return this laptop. Maybe I got a bad egg, and not all of these laptops have overheating problems. Next time I'll just stick with Dell. Amazon as usual were exceptional in their support and I got a refund no problem.",0
"instaled win 11 , i think its to erlie to use it yet -still have bugsbattery lower then , other thinks is goodnice pc",0
Died after 1 year and 6 months. I loved the touch screen aspect and the long battery life. Used it mainly to write papers and research for my graduate projects. About 6 months ago it started to shut down and yesterday it wouldn't connect to the internet that all of other devices are easily connected on. All the while it is shutting down whenever it feels like it. Not worth it if you want it to die in less than 2 years.,0
"I purchased this Chromebook for my mom as a Mother's Day gift and she absolutely loves it! She's not a very tech-savvy person at all, and her main use for a computer is for checking facebook/her email, ordering things, and watching some movies/videos. Its simple enough that she is able accomplish everything she needs, which has thankfully minimized her calling me to help walk her through simple tasks. While it is simple enough for her to use on her own, it also simultaneously gives her the joy of having a personal computer that she can take anywhere.I would definitely recommend this Chromebook for anyone that only needs to accomplish basic online/computer tasks and does not care about/have the need for having something with great performance.",0
Great laptop. Top rated for good reason.,0
"Impressive CPU and GPU, IPS-level display, solid amount of memory, good sound, and best RGB keyboard make this a premium gaming laptop that comes at affordable price. I wasn't satisfied with the size of the 512GB NVME SSD that came with it, so I added a 2TB SATA in the available bay. The laptop can be a bit loud when the fans kick in during heavy GPU utilization, but that's expected! Love this laptop.",0
"It’s an amazing product that Ive been looking for . Light , powerful and stylish. Definitely recommend!",0
Can’t go wrong with Samsung. Purchased for my son to use for school and he loved it. He has been using it for more then a year and not one single problem. He uses it everyday and at times to watch movies. He loves it and great size for a 10 year old.,0
"Was an OK computer, but ordered the more expensive model, which was worth the extra $100",0
This little computer is very fast and does a great job. Very easy to set up. Really don't have to do anything to get it up and running. Very pleased with this computer. Highly recommend!,0
"Great gaming laptop, especially for the price! This pc will meet your needs. I'm a FPS gamer, and it runs everything on ultra with a smooth 60+fps.",0
The Laptop is just perfect.I have played Avengers & Gta V in high graphics all work smooth.There should be no doubts on the performance as well as i used premier pro which also seamlessly workedGo for it. Best Gaming & Work Laptop as such cheap rates.,0
Great for AutoCAD and electrical engineering software!,0
"Exceptional packaging, arrived 2 days earlier than expected, grandson is ecstatic over this purchase! Could not be happier with the product, the price, the shipping, and the seller!! ?",0
The HP OMEN is a very well designed and fast gaming laptop,0
A plus quality as expected however no port outlets for other services,0
"Worth the price of admission. It's a beautiful computer. It does exactly what you'd expect - It's sleek, well built, powerful, exceptionally fast, and plays any game you throw at it perfectly.",0
absolutely love this laptop,0
"I bought this laptop to be able to work remotely and also play call of duty world war II. I tried to make the best of the preloaded operating system with the stuff that was on there, but I did not like it. I downloaded the Windows 10 creation tool and put that on a USB. I booted to USB and did a clean install of Windows 10 home. Afterward I started utilizing this little beast to play call of duty. Let me tell you, I have never in my life seen a laptop get this hot! When I say hot I mean it will burn your freaking fingers! The panel center of the screen above the keyboard was so hot I could have literally fried a piece of meat on it! I'm not kidding! Luckily for me I had a five fan laptop cooling device that I plug into my USB and was able to put it underneath my laptop which yielded impressive cooling to this machine. Let me tell you it is still hot! But not so hot that it would burn you now. I am very worried that the heat that is generated from this machine will make it die too soon. Otherwise I am averaging a hundred and sixty three frames per second on call of duty world war II, I do not have the settings to max on anything because I want performance more than I want beautiful pictures. I hope this review helps some of you and especially I hope this helps the people at Acer so that they can design some type of better cooling system for future gaming rigs at this price point.",0
The materials of the laptop feels great and it has and excellent perfomance with autocad and revit,0
Satisfy my needs,0
"The software compatibility of this computer is excellent, but the color accuracy of the screen is mediocre. I hope they will incorporate OLED technology for a more vibrant and true-to-life color representation.",1
"The laptop itself works great, very fast startup, windows is as responsive as ever, all the software i use has no trouble running.The only problem i've faced is the battery life, while this page advertises it as 14 hours, in actual normal use, I could only get about 5 hours at most.The laptop is great though, superb build quality, and everyone loves the unique pale gold color.",0
lack SD card reader and ports,0
"Seem to be a good computer. I purchased this to run a CNC , but had problems down loading the needed programs. After taking to to a computer knowledgeable person (which I am not) they determined it was because of the Windows 10S. No where in the description does it say 10S. Luckily he was Adele to remove the S and all seems to be working fine now. There needs to be Full Disclosure on items. Stop hiding the truth.",0
"It is not quite as portable as I had hoped, and in order to keep the battery life long, you have to turn down performance, which is a bummer",0
Computer is lightweight and fast but... right out of the box I had a service battery notice. Charged it up and it was still there. Made an appointment with the nearest Apple store (20 miles away). They confirmed my Mac was made this month so it was brand new but they can’t replace it since it was bought from Amazon and not Apple. They sent it out for a new battery under warranty which was to take 3-5 days and they have had it a week now and haven’t completed the repair yet. All around not a good experience for my first Mac and spending a thousand bucks on a laptop. I’ll be going back to pc after this.,0
It's my first laptop and it came with Xbox pc pass unlimited free for a month and the macafee anti-virus is ok but it gave me issue trying to subscribe because the laptop didn't meet certain encryption requirements so I got Norton which installed once I uninstalled macafee amd had no issues with it I use it mainly for games than as a pc i got skin for it I kept the sticker near the mouse amd put it on the bottom but the skin doesn't cover the inside so I made use of the scraps after cutting it to size and based on the settings the battery can last bit if your gaming it will go quickly and it will warn you before it turns off at 14 percent unless you plug it in but get an Xbox controller as it will work with it using Bluetooth I recommend it,0
Only real con is for speaker quality. Other than that I'm happy with my purchase,0
"aun que ahora tiene un precio mayor. yo la compre cuando estaba en 950 dolares, mas los impuestos y envió, me salio mucho mas económico, de lo que pedían las tiendas en mi país (al rededor de 1500 a 2000 soles de mas).hasta ahora no e tenido problemas, la temperatura de la tarjeta grafica no pasa los 66 grados C, la batería me llego a durar hasta 5 horas en ofimática con su plan mas ahorrador, al principio algunas veces se demoraba un poco mas de lo normal en encender(lo normal 10 a 15 segundos) pero luego se soluciono .supongo que con la actualización.el pedido me llego en 10 días. lo único malo del envió es el transportista(UPS-union pack Peru), cumplieron con los plazos de entrega y si me respondieron las llamadas. pero no me entregaron la factura (invoive) y lo mas importante la DUA (declaración única de aduanas) , según Amazon el transportista es el encargado de todo el tramite de ingreso, por último la caja de envío estaba aplastada de un lado como si hubieran intentado sacar algún objeto peque?o, pero felizmente solo venia la laptop Lenovo, en fin por no tener esos documentos no puedo declarar ante la SUNAT la compra de este equipo,estoy contento con el equipo, pero no me gusto esta parte del transportista designado en mi país. tengo entendido que DHL si hace la entrega de esos documentos de entrada, yo creí que enviarían mi pedido por DHL ya luego decía que seria por UPS, y estas obligado a que sea con UPS, por que no hay opción para elegir como en otras paginas.",0
"Everything about this machine has been fantastic. I could not afford new, but I have found this only a hairsbreadth less than spanking new. Best for me, since I was away from the wonderful Apple side for several years, Apple help is as fine as the machine. Plan to go this route next time.",0
"I'm not sure why the reviews are so low. I've had mine for 2.5yrs - still works great. Had a small piece of plastic break off in transit from class one day, gets lugged everyday (I was a student when bought, now a teacher). I use the touchscreen daily in tablet mode with the Scrbble app for a notepad. Bought the pens that go with it still gets 5+ hrs of battery life even when watching videos. I love this computer and am surprised at how many have had issues!",0
"INCREDIBLE LAPTOP, SSD MEMORY MAKES THIS LAPTOP FLY AND SCREEN IS BEAUTIFUL, ALSO BATTERY IS AMAZIN",0
it’s a great tool for everyday use school and work for both light and heavy use that use a new storage option called an M.2 that loads data faster than traditional Solid State Drives (SSDs),0
"I am happy with my purchase it handles the games I play Perfectly. The fan can be load when set at max, but if you are using headphones you won't notice it. After a while I even tone it out. The fans keep it really cool. Getting the back cover off to do upgrades can be a little difficult because of clips that hold it on. The speakers are ok as with the built in web cam. It is best to be plugged in while using the battery only last a couple of hours. Overall For the ram and graphics card it comes with and the price it is worth it.",0
"I love my Zenbook! Does everything I need, but I wish the speakers were louder.",0
The item that is not that important to include is the PRODUCT CODE as their only human?,0
Computers touch screen stopped working after a week every time you close this laptop it has a chance to crack the screen shuts to hardJust not a good laptop for the price,0
its great if you dont need cd drive or dvd player,0
Bought this for my son for high school since they decided to have the students being their own device. He really likes it and it's lightweight. A good buy for the price on a short notice.,0
I love this computer. Very light and easy to use.So much happier that I back with Dell,0
"My wife, who is not as mobile as she used to be sits with the computer on her lap 10 hours a day. Our 19 year old cat likes the warmth as she lays next to it in my wife's lap.",0
"El equipo llegó en perfectas condiciones, incluso se adelantó un día en la llegada.Viene excelentemente equipado con el procesador de ultima generación y en serie HQ que lo hace mas potente para los graficos, ademas la tarjeta de video que incluye es de gran rendimiento. El almacenamiento tambien es super bueno, con disco en estado solido de 256 GB y disco duro de 1TB.Excelente compra, además de ser muy liviano y tener un gran diseño sobrio!!!",0
it is light weight and easy to use in your lap for day to day work.,0
"This laptop is great! have heard bad reviews about keyboard, but its fine. Speakers are on bottom of laptop so sound is soft at times, and screen doesnt tilt back as far as id like but minor flaws, great hardware and laptop for the price!",0
Uses storage tooooo fast,0
"I wanted to wait until I had used this item for a couple of weeks before completing a review . There have been no issues and no problems and it arrived on time and at a good price. This is the second ACER I have had and both have been reliable with excellent battery life. It's a fairly basic unit but for what I use it for, I am pleased with it.",0
Don’t buy it.,0
"not the best nor is it the worst gaming laptop out there. The display is very dark compared to even a cheap gaming monitor. It only has 1 stick of ram so it runs in single channel, majorly impacting its overall performance. It does have a small m.2 boot drive which really helps improve its overall responsiveness. For non gaming enthusiasts I would definitely recommend as a starter gaming laptop.",0
the space bar is sunken in on the right side and works only half the time when pressed with the left thumb while touch typing,0
"This laptop has the 110 watt 2070. Despite that high wattage video card, the fans don't run hard when they are set to the regular ""automatic"" mode. You can press a button at the top right of the keyboard that forces the fans to run at full speed but so far it has not been necessary. I don't run super intensive games with it, Just WoT, and WoWs, as well as Armored Warfare and Warthunder. I will update this review once I have played something more intensive. So far though, in the games mentioned above, I get 150+ fps with everything on highest settings at 1920x1080P and 144hz. Not bad for a laptop, especially considering the fans on auto rarely go above a low rpm.The first laptop I received had an obvious problem with the graphics chip heat sink fan. It ran hot as hell, even with the fans forced to run at full speed, and it crashed very frequently in games no matter the measures I took.The speakers aren't bad, for a laptop. You can watch a movie on the built-in speakers if you turn the volume up all the way, just don't expect anything more than ""ok"" sound quality and volume. Its acceptable for a laptop, thats about it. The keys feel as though they are slightly convex. Because of this, my fingers always feel as though they are sliding everywhere on the keys, probably because they are. The keys when pushed in have a nice positive feel to them which loans some tactility back to the keyboard. The right-side shift key is annoyingly short, but I will get used to it I hope. The backlighting works well, with the led light showing up through the keys so you can read the letters in the dark as opposed to cheap led backlit keyboards that only have the led lights under the keys, but they don't shine up through the keys. The wireless X card is stupid fast; I was getting sustained download speeds of 22Mb/sec, and it may be capable of more though I haven't checked what the theoretical speeds are. The bluetooth works well with very minimal sound lag while watching youtube videos using a bluetooth (4 or 5...not sure which) speaker. There are several driver updates from MSI as of this writing, and a BIOS update as well. The UEFI BIOS is a bit sparse in options compared to a nice desktop motherboard wherein you can adjust all kinds of clock speeds, voltages, and bus speeds as well as tons of other stuff (DRAM timing, split bank speed on and on), you don't have any of that capability in this BIOS. The NVMe drive is a liteonit CL1-8D512. Its probably middle of the road insofar as speed though this is obviously anecdotal. My western digital Black 512gb in my desktop is a little faster. Don't forget, you can add an internal SSD or 2.5"" hard drive to this laptop. That is kinda cool. Battery life is pretty average under light loads such as internet browsing and typing, I get about 5 hours. Thats not bad considering that this laptop is not an ultra-portable unit with an ultra low power processor and screen. I wish it had G-sync or at least a way to disable the intel graphics, and I wish it had another USB 3.1 gen 2 (type A or C, whichever) port. I think that by now, all chipsets should be running all 3.1 gen 2 (10gbit/sec) by this point. The chipset is comet lake with HM470 south bridge and the processor is socket 1440 FCGBA.",0
VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND ARRIVED AT TIME,0
I was not able to verify that the laptop has GB Intel Optane memory. Windows just reports 8 GB RAM,0
"Fast and powerful laptop, with case prone to fingerprint smudge",0
"I bought this to do social media and blogging only. It has been exactly what I needed. Long battery life, and the touch screen is a life saver. Had for almost six months, and had no issues so far.",0
"For the price I guess I shouldn't have expected much, but I keep finding annoying bugs or performance problems. The bluetooth connection stutters really badly so I can't listen to music with bluetooth headphones or speakers (tried many different fixes). Zoom or Discord calls seem to just be beyond its processing capabilities. And only a few weeks in it has started crashing, usually restarts on its own after a few hours of use. Having too many things running (like 5 chrome tabs plus discord plus slack) will also make it crash. The taskbar also recently started this thing where it flickers for a few seconds then stops, very weird.That said, it does accomplish the bare minimum of what I was looking for, a small device I can comfortably use to write emails and work on google docs while on the move. It doesn't seem to comfortably handle much more than that.",0

"When I playing game, this laptop provide a beautiful display and good sound quality to me to enjoy",0
I needed a new computer and this one is just right for me. Very easy to set up and user friendly. I don't know a lot about computers but my sons said I made a good choice with this one. The rose gold is a fun color and a change from drab gray or silver.,0
Great computer. Love the keyboard.,0
"Just received my laptop. Was nervous, when reading some of the reviews, but it is beautiful, and starts up quickly. Games run flawlessly. I have heard complaints of a loud fan, but so far, my unit has been fairly quiet. Overall, I am enjoying it, and look forward to future use.",0
"XE521QAB has a ""common issue"" with this unit according to a Samsung Authorized Service Center. Hinge breaks away from plastic top cover mount. Official Samsung chat (website where you are logged in with your warranty info) will refer you to the Authorized Service Center who will tell you there is a ""Free of Charge"" repair, however Samsung must provide you with a Shipping label that has a Service Ticket Number included, in order for the repair to be covered under the One-Time Coverage. If you are six months out of warranty forget it. Not covered. I am not the first person to take time and energy to type this type of review. Look it up on leading big box stores website comments for this product. In my case I had bought two of the exact same models approximately a month apart, for personal use. I bought one and my spouse liked it, so we bought another since our existing Chromebooks were going End of Life soon. Here is the deal: The left hinge mount broke away from the top cover mount point (see photos engineers) approximately three weeks from each other. Personal use Chromebook, light usage by adults, broken hinges. Samsung USA chat support = no help. Referred me to Authorized Service Center and they will not talk to you unless you have a service ticket from Samsung. Constant loop. Two laptops, about $1,000 USD, useless. Warranty is six months expired with two years left on Google software support updates on Samsung Chromebook Plus V2. Still being sold new. Unacceptable. Do not buy. Chat support would not escalate to manager or executive complaint. #samsung unacceptable product fail. #Google hope you are monitoring your brand partners.",0
"I believe i've found my unicorn because this particular macbook air still lasts an insane amount of time! Although i don't use it on full brightness, i regulate it a lot. Connecting several devices to it via bluetooth is transparent, but unfortunately, Apple made the macOS more inconvenient to handle in terms of simplicity.User experience on the macOS is weird, you know as a mac user where things used to be, then you have to relearn some things and it doesn't feel like home, the new normal isn't good so far.Keyboard is relatively quiet, also, there's the missing keyboard light on this iteration of the macbook air, why did you take (probably) the most useful key from us?! if you're watching a movie you have to literally stop the movie, go through the menu from above and turn off the keyboard lights, or if you're on a presentation and everything is dark, you just turn your screen light down but you can't with your keyboard because you need to actually stop paying attention to the presentation and go through the menu, inconvenient as heck!I know (and i'm very well aware) that there are some workarounds to change to the keyboard light again using a small software... but that isn't the end-game, the thing is that we shouldn't need an extra software or aditional configuration just to use something the macbook had for, literally, over 10 years!Speed on this macbook: you don't even feel it... everything is instant, nothing is slow, if something is, it's most likely the software or the website you're on, is that simple! If you're planning on using massive storage, you should use an usb-c one, not an usb-a through usb-c dongle, you will have a bottleneck, that's guaranteed.I haven't used it on games because that's why i have my pc and xbox for. However, if you're planning on developing software on it, just make sure your libraries fit within 228gb (the half of it is recommended for all ssd's) of storage, if that's gonna be an issue, then go for usb-c massive storage.Weight isn't a problem, it makes you feel like you're having a premium laptop on your hands, but not enough to make your bag heavier. Construction feels like you own something premium and well-made.",0
This Laptop on the first charge got extremely hot and so did the keyboard. So I gave it a second chance on the second day and the same thing happened again. Needless to say I returned the laptop for a refund! The only good thing out of this was that UPS came and got it from my home. Saved on Gas!!!,0
"It’s been over nine months and works just fine for my day to day duties. Screen brightness isn’t the best but is ok if you’re not bothered by dim light.Love back light on keyboard, great to use at nights.Very compact and light weight, like the colour too.Battery lasts fairly long as I only need to charge it once per day.",0
"I've been on the market for a good gaming laptop for a few months because I travel often for work and this has been perfect. A good size and weight make it easy to fit into any backpack, and the specs are able to handle anything with ease. The laptop battery is what you'd expect from a gaming laptop, and that its implied to be plugged in most of the time, but is suprisingly better than what I saw from other comments. Haven't had it die on a flight yet!",0
Nice. serves its purpose,0
"This computer is good for the price, it’s hard to find a new computer with 8gigs of ram for under $400 so that is a great feature. I wanted something I could use for casual gaming and it does an acceptable job, nothing overly impressive the frame rates are pretty low sometimes on some games but low demanding games like Minecraft run well.The screen quality is fine, colors are a bit dull but in all honesty it’s not really a huge issue.One thing I will say is the computer does not have very much storage, if you are planning on using it for gaming buy an external drive to put the games on.",0

Bought 1 for both the 13 yr. old & 14 yr. old. Great for school work.,0
"Bought this at $650, and I have yet to play a game it can't run smoothly. Bought a 2TB storage device, so the 250 GB storage issue wasn't a problem.",0
"I really wanted to like this laptop because of the hardware, but I no longer trust gigabyte. At this price point, I would never expect to first receive the wrong item, a much cheaper laptop, and then have it replaced for a correct but defective model.Once I got things installed and restarted for the first time, the 15P XD would freeze within seconds after logging in. No Blue screen or error message, just a complete and irreversible freeze. The last time I remember this happening was in the early 2000s on an old Dell desktop. I factory reset the laptop multiple times using multiple recovery methods, and the problem persisted. Wasted 12 hours of my life. ""XD"" in the name is appropriate because this laptop is a joke.I blame gigabyte and not amazon because gigabyte was shipping directly to their distribution center. Also, their software/hardware is suspect for the cause of the issue. Amazon was helpful in processing the returns. I'm still waiting for my refund, though.",0
I have been in search for a Windows tablet.,0
This purchase for me was an upgrade from a old MacBook Pro I’ve been using for over 4 years got a refurbished MacBook Pro 2012 for Christmas 4 years ago so I when I saw the 2020 MacBook Air new not refurbished for 899 bucks I jumped on it and I’m glad I did because it’s a great MacBook fast efficient I edit videos for YouTube everyday and this MacBook does it way faster than my old slow MacBook Pro so I’m very happy a must buy for sure,0

"Aside from not having a back-lit keyboard and having an absolutely terrible battery life, this computer does the trick.",0
"We are using this laptop for livestreaming at our church. I've only had it for a few days, but it has worked well so far. Easy to set up and using it with vMix was no problem. Seems plenty fast enough and the screen is quite bright. I'm driving an external monitor with its USB-C port quite easily. So far, we've encountered no problems.",0
"So let's start with the high points...Astecatilly its a very nice looking laptop. the keyboard is pretty good to type on and the backlight is nice. The built-in speakers should win some kind of award because they're unbelievably impressive for a thin and light laptop.so the downside...the stock screen is atrocious, no exaggerating it's really that bad. however, it is upgradable to the IPS panel offered in a much harder to find a variant of this laptop. its about $70 and take 20min to make the swap, just search ""vivobook M580VD-EB76 screen IPS 72%NTSC"" it will be the first search result. I did the swap and it was worth every penny and only took a few mins, I cant say for sure but this probably voids the warranty.",0
"This has a touchscreen/??how do i enable pls halpOtherwise great laptop. Easily carriable, plays league great, same with civ5 and tf2.Great for homework at Starbucks.",0
Good all-round business/home machine. There is enough speed and power for my usage and it's easy to carry on business trips. I wish it was touch screen but the back-lit keyboard was a bigger priority. I understand what people mean with the soggy touch pad as it gets a bit of getting used to. Lets hope the screen hinge lasts longer than my last ASUS did which crapped out on me at about 18 months - but I was admittedly hard on it.,0
"It charges fast, the battery lasts more than 7 hours deppending on the use",0
"I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this is a big ticket item for most people.I have nothing bad to say regarding the particular XPS 9500 unit I received with a couple of caveats...The Bad:Similar to other reviewers, I suspect this product is not ""NEW"" as described but rather returned and/or refurbished. It came in a rather torn up box which was simply sealed with regular packing tape. It was shipped to Amazon from a company that appears to be an authorized reseller/or refurbishing center as far as I could tell from a quick Google search. The box had certainly been around the block a time or two, LOL.Given the price point and specs, I'm not surprised if it is a ""refurb, open box, return, etc."" I'm only surprised that Amazon sells them at a steep discount but describes as ""NEW"". I could be way off base here, and perhaps Dell ships most of their products in beat up boxes, and I'm just unaware of it.The Good:I know the above sounded very critical, but bear with me. Once I opened the outer box, the inner Dell box was pristine. Everything was nicely packaged and appeared brand new. The usual protective plastic peel off, unwrap, etc. stuff was all there on everything. There wasn't a fingerprint or speck of dust to be found. Even smelled ""like new"". So...I figured I'd give it a go. Set it up and everything seemed fine, so I opened it up and upgraded memory to 64gb. Everything internally looked new to my untrained eye as well. I've been using it for several days with no issues. Overall, I personally am happy for the price, but if these aren't truly ""new"", I think description should reflect that.Considerations:My laptop before this one was an XPS 15 2012 or 2013 model. It originally had Windows 8 on it FWIW. I had upgraded to SSD, switched to Win10, maxed out RAM, and replaced battery over the years...Just so you know my basis for comparison.Other reviews on both Amazon and online mention crackling speakers and faulty trackpads with this model. My experience has been that speakers sound as good as any laptop I've ever heard, and trackpad is slightly less sensitive in top corners but otherwise fine (I never would have noticed trackpad thing except for online reviews had me looking for faults.) I personally find the speakers and trackpad perfectly fine. Another criticism has been loud fan noise when laptop is trying to cool. It doesn't bother me because my old XPS sounds like a turbo spooling up when it's under a load too! Maybe other brands are quieter, IDK. Fan noise wasn't a big concern of mine.Perhaps mine was a return/refurb that had faults addressed, I just got lucky and got a good unit, or the faults aren't as bad as they are made out to be with this model. I can't say for certain, but that's my experience thus far and honest review.",0
Totally met my expectations.,0
"This is a 5 star product given what it is for the price point. So why only 1 star? I will remove this review if all works out with returning and/or repairing. However, for now I can only give 1 star because it radomly crashes on me! And you have to hold the power key for 20+ seconds to restart and then redo whatever you were working on. Only happens a few times a week and it may be due to needing updates for some of the software...so stay tuned. I saw someone else with the same problem. Not sure if this is an exception or a trend. Like I said, will bump to 5 stars if I decide to return and that goes smoothly or it magically stops crashing on me...Bigger picture. This is exactly what they say it is for an amzing price. If you are in the mood for a cheap and super lightweight and portable chromebook with excellent battery life and super fast internet connection then this is a good buy, just as long as they software issues do not continue!",0
This laptop is a great value for your buck. Loads fast. Worth every cent.,0
cheap build materials but the most powerful in this price point!,0

Per-key RGB lighting is a perk though,0
My Dell Windows 10 Inspiron died and I thought I would try Chromebook this time. I was disappointed to find out Chromebook doesn't print.,0
"This laptop definitely has its pros and cons but for the price range that is to be expected. Many other reviews complain of sound which is very quiet but the laptop has bluetooth so I was able to just Bluetooth a speaker to it to solve that issue. I have no issue with the screen like many others have so either I’m not picky or I got lucky to get a good screen. This laptop does come with a 1 year manufacturer warranty. Which I am currently in the process of using to have a faulty hinge replaced. 8gb of ram is more than enough for my online college classes but there is also space to expand this if you need to. I’m also able to run sims 4, wizard 101, and other more minor games with no issue. It can run games like fortnite but it only runs on the lowest graphics setting and gets hot fast so if you are looking to do more online popular games I would suggest a different laptop with better specs all around. I did only get the 128gb of space but to fix this I bought an external SSD with a 500gb capacity. They have different sizes which is something you should look into before buying so you know what to expect for more space. All in all it’s a perfect laptop for me. The battery life is fine for most of my school work I can normally run it from full for 1-2 hours depending on if I’m doing work or gaming. I would recommend this laptop for anyone who just needs a basic laptop for everyday use that isn’t gaming. Unfortunately if you want a laptop for a more intense gaming experience you’ll need to be looking at laptops much higher than the price of this one.",0
Have bought 4 now. Work excellent!!!,0
Received item and the screen on the laptop keep flickering.,0
"Looks brand new, fast, works great.",0
La compra fue hecha para uso normal. No para juegos así que personalmente cumple con todo.,0
Great quality laptop that runs everything I have thrown on it! Battery life is okay. But isn't a concern for me because I always keep it plugged. My only problem so far after a few months of use is the keyboard. As shown by my picture my A key has lost some of it's black paint and will probably lose more seeing as I tend to use it a lot while gaming. Other than that it's a good quality laptop worth the price,0
"Fan is noisy when playing movie or gaming, other than that it is a decent product.",0
"I love this laptop and everything about it but the overheating problem. With normal operation everything works good and no problems but when I game on it the temps would get up to 98 degrees Celsius which is hot. Asus standard is 100 degrees Celsius which is okay for them but Intel says no way. So I called Asus and told them my problem and they were willing to help me, but I am currently in online college for software engineering and this was at the time my only computer so I could not send it in for repair like they wanted me to because I could not miss school. Asus really had no real solution to my problem other than take it to a computer specialist and have it fixed which would be no different than sending it to Asus. So me being the the computer specialist I am I took upon myself to fix it. So what I did was take it apart and use liquid metal on the cpu and the gpu heat sinks and the result was amazing, it was running 20 degrees Celsius cooler wow. Also dont leave your charger behind this laptop dont last long on a charge. Now that I got the overheating problems fixed its the best gaming laptop for me because I dont game all the time, I do my school work and game in my spare time to unwind. So if your a good tech and like to work on your computers this is the one for you so good luck !",0
"laptop was exactly as expected, brand new with no blemishes.item came the exact day amazon said it would with the regular usps mail. do your research on windows 10S. the ""S"" mode is a feature meant for students in a school or for children or people that constantly click on links that provide malware and viruses to your computer. a quick trip to the windows app store on your laptop, you can take this function off but you can not get it backk.2gigs or ram kinda sucks but for a laptop that cost 153$ i really cant complain.",0
Thanks a lot!,0
"I paid 1.150$ for a decent gaming laptop and I couldn't be happier. Yes the charger brick is chunky and the battery life isn't on a macbook's level, but it's a great machine for the price and I think I got what I paid for. I was between this and the Acer Nitro 5 (which I have had before) and this bought me with a cleaner design.The multicolor keyboard was a little too much for me but luckily you can configure it to the color you want, and I chose white.",0
Works great for college. solid state hard drive is great and boots up fast.,0
"Got this product yesterday and it’s already a game changer. Booted up smooth on the first try and was able to cut through everything right away. Got Steam on it and it’s running games better than my current tower. Graphics are beautiful and the speed is great for a small laptop like this. Add in features like MSI Dragon and you get the light up keyboard that usually you can only enjoy with a full size gaming keyboard. Plenty of ports. Plenty of storage. It’s upgradeable. And so far, cooling has not been an issue!",0
"Really like this purchase. Core i3 1005G1, 128GB NVME SSD and 8GB RAM. It feels very snappy and responsive. The fingerprint logon is super fast and is one of the reasons I got it over the cheaper Acer. I got this for my wife as she only needs the most basic specs but I did not want to settle for anything less than a 10th generation Intl Core or 4000 series AMD Ryzen. I really would not change a thing about it for the price except that it should have had 250GB to 500GB of storage. The OEM is only paying $20 for the Hynix SSD they could have invested $10 more for a larger SSD. My laptop has 32GB of RAM but 8GB in this laptop does not feel slow at all. No bloatware from Asus at all. Office365 being pre-installed in three separate languages is unforgiveable by Microsoft. And why does it take 7 minutes to uninstall each language? Are they hoping you lose patience and give up the install so it can keep pestering you? Windows S Mode is annoying and disabling it is the only reason I had to help my wife set up this laptop. Although Windows S mode might be the reason it has so little bloatware installed.Pros: Ports! Wow it so nice to have 4 USB ports and one of them being USB-C; NVME SSD; 1920x1080 display with decent brightness. Core i3 super responsive. Light weight and slim. Thin bevels. Very premium feeling plastic case like it better than the aluminum HP Envy it replaced and is far lighter. Excellent keyboard and track pad.Cons: No RJ45 wired LAN. For the price it exceeds my exceptions in everything except storage. 128GB is on the small side. I would rather upgrade the the storage later than buy something else with a larger drive. LCD could use darker, blacks, but that is a picking at a small detail at this price point. The viewing angles are on the poorer side but I don't care about that and neither does my wife.Update 2020/10/15Was getting long stutters running Zoom Video Conferencing and Google Sheets in the FireFox browser. System resource meter showed Memory utilization at 70% and CPU at 50%. 70% memory usage istto much and it means it was hitting the SSD for pagefile swapping. I had a stick of 8GB DDR-4 2666 laying around so I replaced the 4GB DDR-4 3200 to upgrade it to a total of 12GB RAM. (See included photos) That did the trick. Memory utilization is now 50% for same workload.",0
The good: excellent gaming laptop. Handles anything ive thrown at it.The bad: its possible i got a lemon. There is some issue that has developed the time ive owned it. I suspect the power supply or battery. If it goes to sleep the screen will not turn back on. If you plug in or unplug the laptop the screen shuts off and will not turn back on. If you rest a cell phone on the bottom left hand corner then the screen shuts off and you get a critical pathway failure error. The screen i feel is not as bright as i would like and the sound is not very loud even when maxed out. All in all im having to send it in to acer to have them try and fix it. I would not buy again and quite honestly wouldnt even risk a brand new replacement if i had a choice.,0
"The keyboard on this computer is spacious and comfortable, but the lack of a dedicated numeric keypad is a drawback for someone who works a lot with numbers. I hope that one day we'll see a flexible OLED touchpad that could morph into a numeric keypad or a drawing pad based on the user's needs.",1
"I am surprised about how lightweight this Asus is. It is perfect for school because it won't hurt my back from carrying it around with me.I was initially disappointed because I thought the keyboard did not light up, but you have to press the fn and f4 buttons. So far so good.It sucks connecting to wifi. It’s not the wifi because everyone around me gets connected quickly. When I am in class or go to the school library, it takes a while (sometimes 30 mins) to connect.Another update: I still have trouble connecting to wifi even in my home. Like mentioned before, other devices don’t have any trouble connecting but this computer keeps having trouble connecting and staying connected to the internet. I know for a fact that the internet is not the problem.",0
"People whine about thermal throttling and coil whine, no pun intended! ;) But seriously, I bought this used like-new condition from Amazon warehouse which was most likely a return and CDI showed only a couple hours on the SSD. I love this laptop and have had it for about a month now. I hardly ever write product reviews, but it seems like there are a lot of complaints about this laptop and it doesn't get the credit it deserves. For these specs while maintaining slim and light profile good luck finding a better deal. I did pay $1400 plus tax which is slightly lower than the current price but I challenge others to comment on laptops with similar specs and design quality to compare this to. The Dell XPS 15 is in the archetype but lacks the specs unless you want to pay $2000. And sure, it has a 4k display, but at the cost of earlier GPU model, on a 15"" with the pixel density, 4k is just marketing unless you need 4k for visual design projects there is not much point, you have to render 4k and then increase zoom anyway. There are some drawbacks though and 1. I am not super impressed with the keyboard. It performs fine and no problems with ghosting, but when I'm really hammering away at the keys like I'm used to doing on my desktop pc, there is a slight rattle, but that's just me being too rough on the keyboard due to my fast and high-actuation force typing habits. The next issue is that I really liked the silver design of the UX430UN, and I wish they would have incorporated that design into this build rather than the black spun metal which is very attractive and has class, but also attracts fingerprints. So have an anti-static microfiber cloth and screen/keyboard cleaner handy (which you should when you own a touchscreen laptop anyway), but it's not as bad as I might make it sound. It's not a fingerprint magnet, it's just that the silver spun metal design didn't show any fingerprints, greasy or clean barely. Lastly, sure, there is some thermal throttling if you are playing graphic intensive games, but I can play Destiny 2 on Medium settings with a few things tweaked at 60FPS no problem. It will start to slow down as it heats up a little bit, but a Havik cooling pad eliminates that problem. Keep in mind this is not a gaming-designed laptop although it plays most games very well. The thermal engineering was done well and the keyboard never gets hot, only the back and only when you're running the GPU at full load for an extended period. Any other case it runs cool, setting it on your lap and browsing, editing office files, watching videos, it will stay nice and cool for around 10-11 hours of basic mixed use.",0
"when playing video games, the fans run even at higher speeds, w/o pressing on the area it will make that weird sound and will be really loud when pressed on",0
Battery life is not as high as others 3-4 hours but honestly you should be plugged in if you are doing hard core gaming anyways. The fans are also not the quietest but this machine can handle games like The Hunter Call of the Wild on the highest settings and it doesn’t even blink. Zero lag! 144Hrtz refresh rate is great! Really a great buy and specs out a lot higher than other machines for this price range. My son loves the RGB LED backlit keyboard as well. All around the best value for a gaming machine I’ve seen. Buy it!!,0
it will suck you dry if you are on performance mode.,0
Received the product right before Christmas for my elementary kid’s e-learning. Not even 2 months later devised has a major error message “Chrome OS” missing. Tried to follow steps to reinstall it - next error message due to severe security module not working. Called customer service for support only to end up with the run-arounds. All I want is an IT who can look and repair it. I would never again buy electronics with Amazon. In the store at least I can have customer care look at it and repair it. Very upsetting.,0
"I'm a college student so I needed a laptop that was lightweight, portable, good battery life, and can run multiple programs at once (i.e. Excel, Word, Chrome). I've had this laptop for almost four months now and it has met all of my needs and then some! Battery lasts all day, laptop is extremely light, and I can easily run many programs at once.

"The Good:Speed. Speed. And more speed.The extra bay allowed me to place my old hard drive in it as a bootable device, so I lost nothingI have not had any operating issues at all and it has handled everything I've thrown at it soo far, but I am not a super-high-end gamerThe Downsides:Opening case to add old hard drive requires special tool, but I was able to use blunt end of window razor instead of buying one. If your not comfortable working on stuff and/or don't have the tool, then you may need to pay to have it done.There is bleed in the corners. If it is something that bothers you, then you will be annoyed. I, personally, don't play anything where it is noticeable to me unless I look for it. But it is very obvious on a black screen.My skin PH balance is weird. My skin will destroy all metals except real gold. Where my left palm rests on it, the paint is literally gone and it shows bare metal. I'm not sure if it is my PH or an issue with it's construction, but it doesn't effect anything to go through the problem of doing a return.",0

"Oh man, this MSI Nvidia 3070 Gaming Laptop is exhilarating. I have the capability to run Ultra graphics/ RTX graphics and 144hz. The storage is a bit small for my liking, I plan to soon upgrade my storage and RAM capacity. The CPU, Core i7 11th Gen, is a beast. I purchased the “Used “Like New,” so I obtained this at an affordable price ($1.2k). 2weeks in, I am experiencing no issues. Win 10 can easily be changed to Win 11 for free. The MSI Center application is very resourceful, that’s where you can change the keyboard color and configure/monitor other goodie’s.Overall, if you’re looking for a gaming laptop that’s very powerful and has a decent price tag, I 100% recommended this rig.",0
"I do a lot of video editing and it's relatively okay for that. But when it comes to just everyday work it's not easy to use.

I have tried to adjust the wifi range and strength as well as increase the speed. I have reached out to many groups for support and haven't been able to make it faster, my 5 year old Toshiba is a better unit then this one. The shame of it is I purchased this because it got good reviews online, guess I have to reevaluate what I believe in the future. Moral of the story is you get what you pay for and I certainly did.",0

This fit the bill perfectly, and I highly recommend it to students or anyone who wants a premium ultrabook experience at a budget-friendly price.Display 5/5:This is one the best displays you will find on a device under $1000. 100% sRGB coverage is a must have for me. As someone who does a moderate amount of graphics coding and web design, I need to know the colors on my screen are accurate. For those who don't use this device for content creation, you will still enjoy the vivid colors, respectable black levels, and sharp 1080p resolution. The matte display also prevents distracting reflections. Note: There was no noticable backlight bleeding on my unit. It's there if you look for it, but you would be hard pressed to notice it in any real use case scenario. This is not a fault of ASUS as this is typical for IPS displays in general. I also did not have any dead pixels.Keyboard 4/5:The keyboard is respectable if not remarkable. The keys have good travel but are slightly mushy. My unit will sometimes fail to detect when keys are pressed near their corners. The layout is fine, and the half height arrow keys are surprisingly very usable. This keyboard will not remind you of a ThinkPad, but it will get the job done and has held up well to my coding sessions.Audio 5/5:The audio is excellent for a an ultrabook in this price range. It probably won't fill a large conference room, but the built-in speakers are perfect for online lecture videos or the occasional Amazon Prime video.Build Quality 4/5:This device can't quite hold up to the industry leaders like the Surface Laptop, MacBook, ThinkPad, or XPS products. However, those devices are in other price category entirely. At the current price, it certainly outshines the competition, namely the Acer Swift. The chassis is lightweight, and the spun aluminum finish is a beautiful touch. There is a small amount of flex around the keyboard and screen areas. However, I wouldn't consider it to be durability concern.Battery Life 5/5:The battery life was a major selling pont for me. I am getting 8-10 hours depending on usage. As a student on the go, being able to work all day on one charge is a game changer and should be industry standard by now.Performance 5/5:The quad core Intel i5 8250u processor has excellent performance and represents a huge jump from the previous generation's dual core. Pairing this CPU with 8GB of ram and a 256GB SSD, this device will remain a solid performer for years to come. I can easily run a Linux VM to do any work I can't do on Windows. and the performance is superb. The graphics processor is an integrated Intel UHD 620. While this won't be suitable for any heavy gaming, it is perfectly suited for light graphics work, video watching, and displaying to external monitors. You can even play some older or less demanding video games at respectable settings(CounterStrike: GO, Half-Life 2, etc.).Overall 5/5:This is an excellent ultrabook for those on a budget. If you are still reading at this point, there is a good chance you should go ahead and buy this product. You won't be disappointed. For those with a bit more wiggle room in their budget, take a look at the Zenbook ux410 and ux430. Those devices manage to fit a 14"" screen in the same chassis by using smaller bezels around the display.Additional Comments:This device is highly compatable with Linux. I have had no issues with any distro I have tried. I can confirm it works flawlessly with Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, and with elementaryOS 0.4.",0
Computer has disconnected from the internet twice and says there is no connections available. The only way I have found to remedy this is to factory reset the laptop and start over.,0
Love it will buy again,0
Speakers are on the low end,0
"So had some issues disconnecting from Wi-Fi out of the box, but once the computer updated, it was smooth gaming from there. Was able to stream to my friends while I played “Mortuary Assistant” and play all the games I play perfectly fine!",0
"I'm surprised I'm the first one reviewing this. It's my second Swift 3, and it's a crazy powerful machine. It's about an inch smaller in width than the previous 14 inch Swift 3, but with the same size screen because of the thin bezel. It also feels lighter. The screen is gorgeous. Images are vibrant, and sharp, with just enough contrast to make text pop. The battery life is insane. It has a Micron SSD inside it. It's SATA 3, but I don't notice any difference in speed between this and the nvme in my other Swift 3. Anyway, that's my two cents. It's an amazing little computer that deserved a review.",0
"For what ever reason Razer new laptop has gotten a bad rap. Imaging the quality of a MacBook with the internals of a MSI...not as ugly as most gaming laptops and the annoying lighting can be disable if you need it for work.And when you’re not working it handles games like a champ. I’ve play monster hunter world on high as well as fallout 76. Just don’t expect desktop sound fans. The fans do produce a bit of noise, but only under load outside of that it’s quiet and the batter life is amazing for what this is. Pro tip I bought the 256 gen model and bought a 1 tb SSD offline so I paid about 200 bucks more than what the 512 cost for a 1tb laptop.",0
"Multiple issues with the Chromebook. I want to start this review off by saying that I'm an educator and have been using my Acer Chromebook for over 5 years and it still works great. The Chromebooks my school uses (not Samsung) also have very few problems. I bought this Samsung 3 Chromebook on Black Friday from a big box store with the plans to pass my older machine off to my teenager. The first thing I noticed was that the sound quality is horrible on this compared to my five year old Acer. One night I was watching Amazon Prime movies and the battery was getting low so I plugged my Samsung Chromebook 3 in to the charger it came with and went to bed. In the morning I wanted to finish my movie and when I turned it back on the screen was messed up. I contacted Samsung and described the screen as being blotchy. They told me there was a 1 year warranty and to send it in. I did and a week later I got a message saying that the LCD screen was broken and it violated the warranty. I questioned how I broke it given it was working 100% fine, I plugged it in and set it on a desk to charge, and nobody touched it besides myself (charging in my room). They said they'd fix it for $168 which is more than I paid for it. I declined and it was sent back. I just ordered a generic LCD screen from Amazon and fixed it myself in under 5 minutes. The generic screen was $32. I am completely disgusted with Samsung. This is the fourth product from Samsung that I have had issues with ($3600 designer fridge, $1500 laundry pair, and also a microwave$350 microwave). I've had extended protection warranties on all my other Samsung purchases, but due to the nature of having to buy quick for Black Friday (sells out in seconds) I didn't get an extra warranty. I will never buy Samsung anything again. I definitely would not buy this again.",0
"Though this is a light laptop, it still feels heavy in my backpack - I try to avoid bringing it to class.I've had this laptop for about 4 months and so far so good. The only I encountered in that my screen started flashing (it's hard to describe...), but this probably stopped after I completed the regular software update.I really like the colour. I had a mac before this, and though I do miss Garageband, this laptop has been working just as well for me and is much more reasonably priced. I just need to remeber to keep the anti-virus software updated!My cat also loves this laptop - he loves sitting on it and walking across the keyboard. So far, the laptop has survived all cat-related assaults!",0
"I am pretty blown away by his laptop. I had been using a Dell Inspiron 5755 (12 GB RAM) for years as my work computer, and this is a huge step up. I wish the screen was larger (15.1), but other than that. It is amazing. With 16 GB RAM it exceeds anything I need, and I imagine this would be a dream for a gamer, especially a teen, who would appreciate the lights on the keyboard more than I do. Easy set up. It is, also, surprisingly quiet. It is a bit pricey, but the performance is top notch so far.",0
"Great specs, got this for our child but needed enough spec to properly program and maintain it. Works great, very fast , thin and light weight. The only complain is the screen quality but this is something on all Asus brands, they use a matte light screen that looks faded at the slightest angle. BUT, for the price it's good.",0
"May have been just this unit but screen glitched straight out of box, had tiny gray horizontal lines obstructing view, spent time with Samsung customer service (very good) running through various fixes, rep determined defective unit, easy return through amazon, will look for other options",0
"Super fast machine. Does not have a webcam, but that is actually perfect for my use. More USB ports would be ideal. Fans can be very noisy, and even the keyboard can start to get hot when it gets really going. I am using a KLIM cooling stand, which helps a lot.",0
"work great, love this model. they don't make this kind of computer anymore.",0
"Excelente, it accomplishes everything that it promises.",0
Not sure how great for gaming or if its even touchscreen? I dont think it is ima have to google that one buy everything else is great so far 👍🏼,0
"Fantastic mid-tier gaming laptop. If it goes on sale, it's an absolute steal. Specs are listed, and it performance about as well as it needs to. Runs most games smooth, but beware cooling issues. Best to buy a laptop cooler with it.",0
"First thing to note that is not a good device for entertainment usage as the speakers are bad, and the screen resolution is not good for video playback especially if your eyes are used to 1080p or 4K displays.As mentioned in the title this is a great device for e-mail, internet browsing and typing word documents.Excellent for students and/or those who travel for work as the chromebook is lightweight, rugged, has spill resistant keyboard, and a low price point (when it comes to laptops). Giving you piece of mind if it were to get damaged during transit since almost everything on this device is cloud based (assuming you back everything up)You can install apps on it and not programs to the device (unless you jail break it, but then the specs is bad so you may have a bad time). It's basically a tablet with a keyboard and a google chrome browser which is attached to your google+ account and google drive accountIt has a nice textured grip on top, easy to grab and go.Keyboard is a bit cramped if you're used to traditional keyboards and you may mistype a lot of keys at first, but after a while your fingers will build muscle memory and everything will be fine. Instead of cap lock there's an instant search feature, but you can change it to caps lock in the settings. There's also no insert, home and delete button. Also no F (F1, F2, F3, etc) keys, but there are other built in shortcut keys along the topEntertainment wise, it's not good. Screen is great for productive tasks such as e-mail or typing up an essay, but for watching high definition videos it's sub par. Speakers are on the bottom of the chromebook which doesn't make sense as it muffles the sound. If you have background noise, such as TV running in the background, the TV may overshadow what's on the chromebook (depending on volume set on TV). You cannot play high end games on this device as there will be tons of lag, frame rate drops and/or crashes.Webcam is good. Not pixelated at all. Great for conferences. Skype doesn't work well, so you have to use hangouts or Google Duo.Battery life. If you do not use it for entertainment, it can last around 10+ hours. But if you watch a lot of youtube videos for example it'll drop down to half, around 5 or 6. It charges fairly quickly so you'll be up-and-running again in no timeAdapter it comes with is also portable. There's no power brick, but the plug that goes into wall or power brick socket may take up to 2.5 spaces depending on how you configure itOverall, great travel companion (whether it's a business trip or from class-to-class) for those on the productive side, as you can leave your main power use laptop safe at home. For the price, it's very good as long as the main usage is outside of entertainment (unless you consider writing essay and reports entertainment)",0
"Purchased for gaming on the go. Good performance for the price. Much quieter than I expected, even when the fans are at full speed, the noise is minimal, when using headphones the fans cannot be heard at all. The display is bright enough, for my use I turn the brightness down. Keyboard keys have decent travel and is easy to type on. I don't use the trackpad at all, so no opinion there. It is a little on the heavy side for carrying around, but the chassis and screen have minimal flex, appears to be sturdy. Overall i'm very pleased with the purchase.",0
"Exactly what I ordered for, no problems noticed, machine working super fine with Adobe photoshop, Antlantis, and Archicad softwares. The delivery was super fast as well. Deserve 5stars and more",0
"I had a problem: the computer never turned on. I bought here and bring it with me to my home country: Argentina. Sadly Amazon was of no help because they refuse to pay the international postage for the item to process a refund. Thankfully, Dell costumer service responded very well and a technician came TO MY HOUSE and fix it. The computer had it motherboard fried. It was necessary to replace it. Thankfully for me, Dell did it for free under the guarantee.The computer works very well. I totally recommend it, and the Dell costumer service was surprisingly good, at least in my case.",0
Had my doubts because of the reveiws but so far so good i mean no its not a windows... its used for certain things streaming internet different apps i mean its good for me,0
Perfect computer for my simple. Needs,0
This laptop performs like a $2000+ gaming laptop it has more than enough power to do heavy lifting but makes easy work a breeze! Definitely a good buy wish I would have gotten two!,0
The single channel RAM slows things a bit.,0
Not impressed with Chromebook!!! I regret purchasing the HP Chromebook and unfortunately it is to late to send it back.,0
Tengo problema con la confección al internet ya que no puedo a travez del WiFi. Tengo que conectarla con un cable. Estoy tratando de comunicarme con él vendedor.,0
Excelente producto,0
La calidad de la pantalla es normal no es nada especial podría tener una mejor definición de colores.Pero cumple como computadora de actividades básicas muy fluida gracias a su RAM y memoria SSDLa compré para las clases en línea de mi hijo y noto la diferencia en fluidez de inmediato.,0
"Runs fast, quiet, and reliably. Even with prices reflecting a global chip shortage at the time of purchase, I feel that I got my money's worth. I bought this to upgrade from my old PC which couldn't quite handle Halo Infinite and Elden Ring, and this machine plays them both at max settings and 60 FPS without any issues.My only gripes are two-fold:First, on start-up, it plays a startlingly loud sound at the ROG logo screen. No big deal, this can be disabled.Second, the WiFi card is unacceptably bad, and this is the reason for the deducted star. At startup, it would show networks and connect to them, but several times a day, it would throttle the connection, eventually disconnect, and sometimes stop showing networks altogether. It would do this at high traffic or low traffic, gaming or idling, watching videos or composing emails, completely at random. Updating/replacing/deleting/bribing/threatening the drivers and trying various other recommended fixes did nothing. Ultimately, I swapped it out (literally just moments ago) with an AX210 (~$30 here on Amazon at the time of this review), and so far, so good. This is an easy swap that can be accomplished with some small screwdrivers, tweezers, and a plastic prying tool (I used a heavy-gauge guitar pick). Videos are available on YouTube detailing the process, but anyone with patience, a light touch, and those simple tools can do it.All told, other than the WiFi card, it's great.",0
It came in perfect condition and it's a great laptop!,0
"Overall it’s a good gaming laptop. On the other hand, the screen could be better (I expected higher fps) and so as the fan noise while playing the latest games like pubg for example. But I really like this fast, thin, and light gaming laptop. It’s really good for school purposes too because it’s portable and you won’t look like a “gamer” when you’re using it in public places compared to other gaming laptops.",0
Really wanted a 64 bit computer. Hence it is a little slower than expected.,0
My wife loves this laptop,0
"A trash screen, you will see nothing if the angle is not right.",0
So far it has not given me any issues and has been dependable. I would purchase again.,0
Runs super fast and works great for gaming!,0
"This is a slick little laptop, especially for the money. The processor flies and the slim size and light weight make it SUCH an improvement over my old balky Dell. The comments in the trade press and here about the track pad are true - its definitely the weak link in the hardware. But I'm getting used to it gradually. For not much money they could make this SO much better with a better pad.",0
I got this for my husband. For the money it’s a great laptop.,0
"I opened it for the second time and the screen has a defect, like where it hinges flexed or something and now has a discolored spot at the bottom right.",0
Wireless network on my AC network is amazingly fast.,0
"First hour out of the box. There’s a very cheap feeling and sounding rattle of the aluminum chassis when I type. It’s so loud, it’s possible I’ll get used to it though. And sadly my feeling of this laptop being ‘cheap’ was corroborated by an arrow key coming off the first time I touched it :( the specs are great, and it’s a gorgeous laptop. But damn this feels crappily made.",0
"Mine came last week. i7-7700HQ Nvidia 4GB gtx 1050ti 8GB RAM128GB SSD(Windows 10 & Recovery)1TB HDI installed my Steam, Discord and I've been pewpew(playin) The Division. 60+ fps easily on low to medium gfx settings. High might drop to 30-60fps. I'm currently dl'n(downloading) Deus Ex Mankind Divided from my Steam library. This was such an awesome deal. I had to jump on it to replace my old dinosaur- 2010 Asus K53E-BBR9 with Intel HD 3000 which played what it could and I threw a lot of games at it until I started to get render issues and black screen of death with Insurgency. So yeah my new MSI is an excellent upgrade to handle all 100+ games in my steam library, Origin and Uplay.",0
I have been a Mac user for a long time and this one is certainly up to standards. Got some great help from Mac setting it up and ended the frustrations of my old one.,0
"I did not like that the description says 64GB eMMC storage and 4GB RAM and the laptop really only comes with 32GB storage and 2GB RAM. That is half the performance and value. Otherwise the laptop is super light, great design and perfect for mobility.",0
Died four months after buying.,0
"Great deal overall. Haven't tried out too many games yet but can play Vermintide II, Diablo 3, Halo MCC and the Ascent on high with zero issue. Decent storage overall. Only real downside is how loud the fan is but I've never had a gaming laptop so maybe that's normal.",0
"Until I got this machine I had no idea how really nice using a computer could be. The keyboard is excellent to type on, and I'm picky as I type very fast. But the real mind blower is the SSD. Having only solid state memory makes this machine blazing fast. I watch other people plug along with their spinning hard drives, and think 'they just have no idea what they're missing'!I find a laptop without an optical drive so much better than those larger, heavier, and (yes) more fragile bigger laptops. This Acer 3 is big enough to totally meet my needs, but no hassle at all to carry along on any of my journeys. I can't imagine wanting any other machine, desktop included.It would be nice to have more than 8GB Ram, but I really work my machine and get along fine with 8GB.Bottom line: a real winner. I'm REALLY pleased with this purchase.",0
FOR ME,0
Came as expected in a sealed box and package. Something about a new laptop that makes you feel so motivated to tackle all your tasks. Nothing beats a new Macbook,0
Used for general gaming. very happy with it until it just didnt turn on one day. replaced the cord and it still wouldnt turn on. so. yeah. rather put -out :(,0
"computer works fine, and is fast loading",0
"I first bought an Acer Chromebook without really knowing what to expect or much in terms of research, and lucked out. I got a solidly dependable product I used for 4 years without any hiccups. However, I could tell the Chromebook was starting to approach its expiration - it was having a hard time loading multiple tabs or object-heavy pages and its RAM was probably too low for the rapidly proliferating content on the net. So I chose this Samsung Chromebook with faster CPU speed and twice as much RAM, thinking I would get the same kind of dependable performance, but better! Surprisingly, it was the OPPOSITE. First, the volume was markedly low - I played the two Chromebooks side by side, and I couldn't stream a movie on the Samsung Chromebook without adding a third-party browser plugin to amplify the sound. Fine, whatever. Annoying, but I can live with that. But then the Samsung Chromebook started shutting down the display instantly for no reason, so that I would have to wake it up. The screen also went black when the Chromebook was lightly moved, though it woke up when I used the touch pad. This made me wary, but I'd spent a TON of time doing product comparisons to finally settle on this Samsung, and I just didn't want to undo all that effort and send it back. But then the straw that broke the camel's back. It is constantly freezing or stuttering when streaming movies! For comparison, I tried alternating between the older Chromebook and the Samsung to make sure it wasn't my Wifi being throttled by good old Verizon. Nope! Definitely the Samsung, consistently freezes and stutters on video playback and this is REGARDLESS of time of day. Instead of better performance, I got worse, in every way. Disappointed because I thought Samsung was such a reliable brand, and I didn't even know what an Acer was back when I first bought the older model! I will have to hold out and buy a different brand of Chromebook, maybe go back to Acer.",0

"This first time, low cost Chromebook was purchased exclusively for web browsing and watching downloaded videos. I didn’t research beyond the fact that it was an Amazon Choice, and had great reviews. I wish I had watched outside video reviews first, because outside reviews exactly match my experience. One of my (2) major complaints, is with the screen. The image is not great, and is made even worse by the fact that the screen is dim, even at the maximum brightness setting (see outside reviews). Secondly the unit has also had several screen freeze/speaker buzz events. A (5) second shutdown command won’t turn off the unit, and you can’t pull the battery (integral). I eventually found that pressing the off button for over (15) seconds finally shut off the unit. After restarting, it seems to go for days. Because the freeze events were long lasting, I was able to photograph, but there doesn’t appear to be an “add photo” option on my Amazon phone app. I didn’t immediately return the unit, because I wondered if the Amazon Basics USB to ethernet adapter was the issue, but I have since had freeze events without the adapter. It is still under (30) days since I received the Chromebook, but I can’t return it, due to the Covid-19 self isolation orders. I can’t contact the seller, because this item has become no longer available, and the seller link has been removed. I’m regretting this purchase, but at least it didn’t cost me a small fortune. Next time I’ll research more.",0
Great laptop and great value for money. Only one thing which i think might be software problem or something the wifi some time disconnects for few seconds then connect again (sometimes not automatically and i have to connect manually) i don't know why but only this laptop do it my other devices at the same time never did something like that. The other thing which isn't a big problem is when i use mute function key then try to raise the volume from volume up function key it supposed to unmute and raise the volume it but for some reason it shows that on screen but actually remain muted till i use the unmute function key (this only happens one time after u power up the laptop if u repeat it again it will unmute using the volume up function key) and that's it. Over all great laptop and i think those two problems are only in my unit or in rare units and might be fixed if i reinstall windows or with some sort of update it isn't a hardware problem i guess.,0
"***Second update 12/16/2021Manufacturer warranty allowed me to mail my laptop in for repair. They ""fixed it"" but now it randomly crashes and is running worse than before. $600 paper weight. I'm definitely investing more next time and buying a better brand.***UPDATEPurchased on November 30th 2020 and today I woke up to the black screen of death. No bootable device.I only use this laptop to play WoW, The Sims4 and I watch movies on Prime, Netflix and Hulu. Definitely not happy.I received this laptop a few days ago and I am in love! I'm ballin on a budget but I love to play World of Warcraft and that does require a decent system. I purchased this because it met my budget and I honestly wasn't expecting anything great because of the price but I am thrilled! I'm able to play WOW Shadowlands on high settings (I haven't tried it on Ultra but I wouldn't count it out). I'm adding some extra ram and will eventually expand the SSD. If you're like me and want a good gaming laptop but at a more budget friendly price, this system will not disappoint!",0
Wifi is terrible.,0
"I have to be honest, I was very let down by the initial mis-labeling of these chromebooks. I bought two of these as graduation presents for my brother and sister who just graduated high school. I searched and searched for a better deal than the initial one on this chromebook. Having initially said it had a 500Gb hard drive. I seemed to good to be true, and it was, after having received them the description on amazon changed to the original 16Gb drive. I should have known better as chromebook are always this way. it was too much of a hassle to return them, so I gave them to my siblings anyway. They seem to enjoy them, as they primarily seem to only be useful for web surfing. no document storage, no central ""hub"" if you will like on a regular laptop, only chrome and online storage. you get what you pay for I suppose, I was very let down again, I recommend for extra storage a 128Gb micro sd card, or an external hard disk.",0
"Very timely shipping, received in great shape and worked right out of the box with no issues to report.wife was thrilled with her new laptop. Definitely would buy another one if I needed to.",0
I chose an MSI computer because of prior experience with their customer service - it was great! This computer is exactly what I was looking for as I replaced an aged desktop computer. It arrived early and works great. Absolutely no complaints. It is fast and very stable.,0
The best from the best!,0
Would not buy it again! No apps,0
Started sparking around the power connector about four months after purchase. Called Acer and they sent me a label immediately and I sent it in for repair. They sent it back saying it’s not covered under warranty. I threw it in the trash. Beware.,0
Battery life/portable mode is only ok.,0
"Ya tengo 6 meses dandole uso intensivo editando y creando videos para YouTube con Camtasia Studio, y hasta el momento es lo mejor que he probado (mas de 150 videos creados), excelente tiempo de renderizado, no se lagea cuando se esta editando, y lo mejor, no se calienta mas de lo debido, super fresco, claro esta que la tengo en una base desde el primer dia. Si me preguntan que recomiende esta PC, yo sin dudarlo diria que si. El costo cuando la compre estaba en 1005 USD en promocion y 199 USD de envio a Colombia. Total: $1.205 USD bien invertidos.",0
"typing from this device and I really like it.I urchased it only for typing lectures at university as I am a student. I got it for 170$ and I could be more happy with it.The battery lasts all day (of course it depends how you use it, but I besides typing I also watch som youtube and I always have at least 5 tabs opened in chrome.The display is ok, but considering the price it is really good.A nice add-on will be touch support, but again, 170$, I want to bite my tounge when asking for more.Go for it if you need light usage. Go for A+ chromebook if you need a media consuption device (look for a high resolution and touch support)Cheers!",0

Beautiful laptop for the price. Very lightweight and easy to use.,0
"Computer is large, heavy, slow and gets hot really fast. Every single time I try to stream something that I already have downloaded, it freezes up and lags. The computer works like and old one you have had for a decade there is also no touch screen (which my previous Lenovo had) and basically not a good computer to get.. Will definitely be returning this and trying to find a better one.",0
Great laptop! Only thing negative I have to say is the battery life sucks but that’s to be expected with it being a gaming laptop. I’ve had no hiccups with it,0
Wasn't what I thought it would be,0
Completely dis-satisfied with this product,0
"It died after two months of use and if you read the return policy, they are expecting it to be dead on arrival and you have 30 days to return. Obviously it lived over the 30 days and died soon after. Nobody can figure out why it fried and went dead. Useless!",0
Love the touch notebook. Cheap works. take it traveling,0
"I’m not going to talk about specs because they all clearly listed on the page but more about an experience I have had in a past week with this laptop.First of all I never had a laptop with touchscreen so I’m getting used to it a little bit considering I’m a mouse kind of person but it sure is handy when you don’t have one or when we will be flying.Sizing is perfect for us because this is our household laptop and take with us traveling, it’s light, fits perfectly in my purse or hubbys backpack, sizing is super universal.Everything I streamed so far have fabulous performance, very enjoyable clear picture and sound just right, again very useful in a car or plane for our son.I’m technically behind I think so I couldn’t figure out how to plug in the mouse but there is adapter that comes with it from USB to C that you can utilize but we also have Bluetooth mouse that works perfectly with it.Speed is fantastic, no lagging, just smooth and fast, I mean I can’t ask for better experience. I’m utilizing it with my office products for some work stuff and home, really we using it for multifunctional purposes because it just can handle it on, small but mighty!It’s quite, I use it with no issues when my baby snoozing next to me but it tends to get a bit hot when using it proactively with multiple things running, I might look into cooking pad for it at some point but I really try not to use it too much in bed.We enjoy it, we really do, very user friendly just perfect for our family!",0
"119gig system drive is waaaay too small. Only 6 months later I started running into space issues. This runs hot and the fans are loud. Not a horrible laptop but after a broken screen and some other issues, I am stuck looking for a different model.",0
"This is my third Asus laptop. I am a big fan of this company! The photo reproduced on the touchpad is so cool! You can split dual screens visible on the main screen and put one of the screens on the touchpad and see both items. Set up is simply following the cues. The size and slim design is perfect for me. I would suggest obtaining a carrying case that will store the laptop, power cord and mouse, if you use one, for it. A “sleeve” comes with it that houses just the laptop. I’ve only had it a short time but I’m happy with my choice. It only has one USB port so a multiple hub may be helpful. It has an HDMI port and two thunderbolt ports. It comes with a power cord and an Ethernet connection that plugs into the USB port. I highly recommend it.",0

Awesome gpu and ssd. Screen is reflect proof but is fuzzy at angles. Overall great machine!,0

"I purchased this machine with the purpose of replacing a 9-year-old laptop. I wanted a work machine that can play current gen games away from home and this laptop does the job well, but comes with annoying bloatware and has a ""meh"" internal battery when using work applications. The charging block that comes with it is cumbersome and large, and it makes it hard to situate myself in a public area if I need the charger. This is less of an issue during Covid-era, but is something to consider when purchasing it. The cool thing about it is that it charges very quickly.Wifi works fine and it comes with a ethernet cord slot when you need it. Video quality is good and refresh rate is adequate.Form Factor is strange as the GTX 1660ti pushes past the hinge of the screen, so you have the fans and video components jut out about an inch from where the base of the screen rests. Not a big deal, but definitely different than other laptops.This thing runs pretty hot, and the speakers are on the underside of the machine, if that matters to you. The keyboard feels very tactile and nice, but already prone to dust like a normal mechanical keyboard. I had to use a can of air to get some debris under the right arrow button out straight from the box, which was a bummer. You shouldn't eat while typing or working over a keyboard, but I foresee that being an even worse dilemma for anyone who does purchase this and doesn't heed that advice. The keys seem fragile, and made me too worried to make an attempt to pry off for further inspection.Finally, the computer comes preloaded with software called Lenovo Vantage. It has some features that are useful and not standard to Windows 10, but it also will show you ads in the notification section of your OS, so I was really not jazzed about that.I'll probably forget to update this review down the line if my feelings change, but if it's anything like the last laptop I had, I'll probably bump it up a star or two based on longevity.",0
"I bought this in late March for an employee and found the wifi issues to be a problem right out of the box. If you use WPA2-PSK, expect it to drop your connection like a hot potato every few minutes. If you're using RADIUS, the connection is fine. There's enough of a documented issue with these reviews and some online forums that indicate HP should do something, but they haven't. Returned the product.",0
"As a longtime software developer and user of several different OSes (I know a little about PCs), this is the worst machine I've ever owned. With all updates applied (bios, drivers, OS), it crashes multiple times in a day. Perhaps it's a lemon, but I have a strange feeling that it's AMD vs Intel. It's probably better to leave Ryzen processors to gamers who care to tweak things all the time.",0
Battery is a little mediocre when unplugged,0
Todo me agradó,0
Its good,0
I bought this for my 84 year old mom who struggles to manage the computer. A laptop/desktop were too cumbersome and takes up too much space in her home. This is portable small and can easily be tucked away when she is finished. It is easy for her to use...very easy to set up and get her email which is why she wanted a computer!!! I enlarged the text and she now watches her soap operas and other shows. I also got her a wireless mouse which I highly recommend!! She now loves using the computer!,0
"Excelente producto, empaque al 100%, llegó más pronto de lo esperado.",0
"Delivery - 5/5 - Came after a week about without prime. Great speed!Packaging - 3/5 - Amazon, why did you send it without any packaging? Meh, it's ok I guess.Price - 5/5 - One of the best prices, but it is a budget build... for a 3070 with not much holding it back this is high up on the list for me though!Size - 5/5 - Great compared to my old sager from 4 years ago which I am switching from. So compact!Other points: Not 17 inches... but my TV is bigger so who cares? HDMI is on the side, not like my Sager4k Gaming - 5/5 - I am currently playing BreathEdge and its taking my breath away. This is a beast.So far so good!---Edit: Returned and upset1/5 - Promised headset for review, but no headset. No response. Form incomplete. Why provide this ad in the package and not give anything?1/5 - Performance was subpar. I got a Lenovo with 140w vs this thing sucking only half the electricity and giving half the performance for the same money, I mean I don't care for the electricity bill as much because my goal was a performance laptop when buying a GPU with 3070 on it1/5 - They ""misprinted"" the specs for this model on their own website1/5 - touchpad really bad, I mean I use a mouse, but this thing was pretty off, might as well not have a touchpad from it's quality1/5 - Cyberpunk was laggy here (like 25 frames a second and going to 15 or 10 every minute) vs playing smoothly on the new laptop5/5 availability - hard to get a good lenovo laptop",0
Worst keyboard I have ever used. Returned it to HP for warranty repair twice and the replacement parts failed just like the original ones did.,0
The screen is very clear and beautiful with terrific resolution and vibrant colors.,0
The SteelSeries keyboard has great feel,0
"The battery life is really nice for a gaming laptop as well, and the keyboard is fantastic, even without the numpad",0
"Good price for a great laptop. Has more than enough performance for all but the most demanding uses (eg gaming). Light, good battery life and has backlit keyboard. Although it is plenty fast enough as is, upgrading the hard drive to an SSD would be even faster and extend battery even further.",0

"Great laptop. Games load fast, picture resolution is amazing. No issues or bugs.",0
This is a great machine for any new comer to programming and gaming.,0
"Great value! obviously not a gaming laptop, and the display would be nice to have a higher resolution than 1600x900, but I like all these features - can drive (via its HDMI port) a 4k external display; intel HD graphics 620 is decent performance for non-gamers - has a USB-C port - has a 4core/8thread i5 CPU - great keyboard! - good audio for a budget laptop - 1 slot of DDR4 RAM easy to upgrade with an extra 16 GB stick for a total of 20 GB,should suffice for most peopleCons - keyboard up/down arrows are half size - 1TB drive is not very fast, but easy to replace with an SSD, so still a great value - the other slot of DDR4 RAM can't be upgraded, not even visible without completely disassembling the laptop; may be soldered in, didn't want to take the chance, in any case 20 GB was enough for me, so still 5 stars, but thought I'd mention it for others",0
Bought it cuz it said it was a touch screen and it's not,0
Slowest processing time I have ever purchased with a laptop. You could go to sleep watching the circular arrow go round and round and round.,0
"There is a reason this item is priced economically, they really skimped on the screen. There is a mouse pad, but there is not a left or right click button. Not a touch screen either. This is a bare bones item. Not sure why they call it ""Flagship""",0
Excellent laptop! Thank you!!,0
"I really liked a lot about this laptop but the deal breaker for me is the keyboard, it is awesome in terms of feel don't get me wrong, but for some stupid reason Asus decided to put a raised circular dot on the 'W' key. Every time I play a 'WASD' game I can feel the raised dot and it is very annoying and uncomfortable. It feels like the key cap is dirty...I looked into it and it seems like all the ROG laptops have this raised bump on the 'W' key.Anyways here's the lowdown (with all latest updates installed as of May 9th 2021):Pros: Great build quality, awesome RGB brightness and customization, speakers are really good for a laptop, very fast and performs great, great price for the performance and features, normal usage battery life is acceptable, great amount of IO ports, USB-C PD is great to have...Cons: Keystone is a gimmick, keyboard 'W' key has a raised circular nub, FHD screen text is blurry or has weird aliasing at 100% scaling in windows, cooling is not as good as expected, Armoury Crate software is buggy and does not launch sometimes which causes the shortcut buttons above the keyboard to not respond, RGB ocassionally bugs out and doesn't load presetAsus please offer smooth 'W' keycap, QHD config and remove the keystone and replace with the fingerprint power button from the Zephyrus line...",0

This is LIGHT as well.,0
"I've had at least half a dozen mac laptops and as a non-pro the air is just what I needed. I replaced a Macbook Pro with the touch bar, the only Mac I've had which failed on me, and when I saw the price of new Macbook Pros I about fainted. I don't do graphics or video, I don't play games, I figured I'd just try the basic Macbook Air and see if it was fast enough. Bingo, it's great. New M1 processor is plenty for web surfing, daily use of the full MS Office suite with multiple windows open at the same time, video streaming etc. Battery life is terrific, I can work all day on a single charge! Sure there are people who need a ""Pro"" device but for the vast majority of us, even heavy daily usage, this is a spectacular computer.",0
Pequeña y muy maniobrable,0
"the fan will constantly make this rattling sound that isn't drowned out by earbuds, headphones, or even noise cancelling headphones.",0

If AORUS offers two AC adapters to end user will be fantastic!!,0
"Its slow, colors contrast is terrible and if you click on a story and in it is a sidebar, click on that and its impossible to read as the scroll feature is uncontrollable and the drop down ads take forever to download. in some situations the scrol down feature disappears entirely.",0
"Received this laptop as a birthday gift from my wife. Wanted to get something that would allow me to play the latest games without lag and replace my old laptop that had a failing keyboard. I use my computers for hours on end and have put this through it's paces. For the price (especially considering the cost of things going up) this has been great.Also received 2 game downloads and a laptop sleeve, which are a nice bonus. It's almost unheard of in this economic climate for additional things to be added to a purchase.I'm 99% satisfied with the speed, features, fans, look of the computer. My biggest issues which knock it down to 4.5 stars are the smaller hard drive; really anything less than 1tb is brutal given how big media is now. Yes I realize the cloud is a thing, but frankly I hate it and don't trust using it. It does the space to slot in more storage and I broke down and did (easy process, took 5 min)The other issue is the volume. Yeah laptops aren't known for their sound, most of the laptops I've purchased I always paid for an upgraded sound card or when building my own would upgrade the sound card. It's not an issue when listening to everything, but occasionally a video or game will be noticeably quieter than I would like at max volume.All in all though, especially for this price, the laptop is a great. I expect to get a few years out of it and have no issue thus far. To close this is probably the nicest laptop I've ever had. The keyboard lights, the light on the back of the laptop, nice sleek lines. Hopefully my kids don't start popping the keys off of this laptop like my kids did to my old Alienware.",0
"I've had this laptop over a year now, and I'm still just in love as the day it arrived! The only slight complaint (If you can even call it that.) Is the battery life is extremely short. BUT. With something so powerful I didn't really expect anything less. I don't see this as something to complain about. I've had it last an hour just listening to music and playing non intensive games, but it's been shorter if I'm playing an intense game or working.Now, on to what really matters. The good. Over all I can't recommend this more. It's worth the money. Easily the best laptop I've owned out of the many I've gone through!- Keyboard is durable, and the back light can be dimmed, or shut off if you prefer. Color cannot be changed.- I've never had any problem with playing games. I have yet to encounter anything that doesn't run properly, or gives a lot of lag or stutter (GTA 5, fallout 4, fortnite, etc.) Even older games like TF2 and star wars battlefront 2 play flawlessly, which sometimes don't go well with newer hardware. Anime games will default to dedicated graphics, so just be sure to change which card they run off of, or it'll be hellish to try to play them.- I've had no hardware issues, this laptop will make using anything without an SSD feel really slow and sluggish in comparison. Nothing's broken and the case is extremely sturdy even after a hard fall onto a wooden floor.- Overheat isn't much of an issue, I did buy a cooling pad just to be safe, but with the push of a button you can make your fans work harder, this will keep it at a nice temp while gaming or working with no worries about the damage that over heating can do!- Not just for gaming either, all my work (Art related, mostly) runs flawlessly, it can run art programs, and game creation software without lag, or stutter. I can run multiple programs at once with no issues. You can run multiple instances of art programs, or have many tabs open without worrying about anything.- There's no scratches, but touching it will leave little 'oily' spots that need to be wiped up. Doesn't happen with the keyboard or track pad but with the casing.- You do have the option to turn off the track pad, speaking of which. I've bought a few laptops now that just simply don't allow this option. It's something I care about as I prefer to use a USB mouse, figure others might as well.-Only has 3 USB ports, but you can use an add on that allows more plug ins.- The built in mic is crisp and clear.",0
Great for personal use at home.,0
"What a disappointment. I was so excited to get my new laptop. The screen quality is aweful..graying out if I even shift a bit in my seat. The touch pad was wonky..jerky and not responsive at all, at times. But the real kicker was the volume...or lack thereof. At the highest setting we could barely hear it. So I tried eatbuds. They were even worse. If i held them crammed into my ear I could faintly hear.Just aweful all around. It is boxed and ready to be picked up for return. I have already ordered a replacement...not the same model obviously..fingers crossed!!",0
You get plenty of CPU horsepower and lots of blazing fast storage for a laptop.,0
"Totally worth the price, I've used it for college for the past year now and its awesome!!",0
"I was desperate for a new laptop as my previous one died right in the middle of an exam for nursing school. I needed something quickly, but I wanted quality. I did a quick search to find out what I should be looking for in a decent affordable laptop and this checked all the boxes. I am so happy with my purchase. Setup was a breeze, it took maybe 5 minutes, and maybe an extra 5 for the updates. The picture is crisp and clear, it has great sound, the keyboard is very comfortable and easy to read. I purchased the windows 11 version and have no regrets. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it has a thumb print reader for security and easy sign in. With the exception of heavy gaming, I can't imagine there is anything that the average user wouldn't be able to do for work or for school. I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend it.",0
Funciona rápida y eficientemente,0
"Excellent for gaming, runs quite hot but that is to be expected, only thing that disappointed me was the battery covers the 2.5 Bay. But has another m.2 to make up for it, still wish I had the bay, and the ram is easily accessible",0
"I received this laptop as a gift in 2017, and for the past 5 years it has only exceeded expectations relative to the price. I mostly play fps titles such as siege and Overwatch, both of which run smoothly. Using a bit of DIY skills the useful lifespan of this laptop can be extended by years. About 2 years in I added RAM, 4 years in a repasted the chips and all thermal throttling went away. Recently, I built a new PC in order to have hardware with a clear upgrade path, but my laptop is still perfectly acceptable for running every game I am interested in five years later (with a few minor upgrades/repairs. ). The only con is the battery life, but that was never an issue for me as almost all public spaces in 2022 have easy access to outlets.",0
Purchased as a gift.,0
Muy bonito el equipo.Excelente,0
Satisfied really,0
Machine had a hardware issue and continuously blue-screened. Customer service was miserable and a giant waste of time.,0

"Very nice laptop for the price. Great for school and work, keyboard feels great and the display is clean",0
Good product worth buying,0
"This is a nightmare to use. Passwords are linked to your google account so if you lose that password, you can reset it but it still insists that you use the old one, the one you lost, or you lose everything that you saved. Don’t even try to put your own wallpaper on or use images. It does weird things to them. I wish I had saved my money and got a different laptop.",0
"Llego antes de tiempo y en muy buenas condiciones, me ha funcionado muy bien hasta ahora, creo que fue una buena compra.",0
"Es muy buena máquina la verdad por el costo me sorprende lo rápida que es, además que viene ya cargada con Windows 11, el único punto negativo que le doy es que anuncian que la pila dura hasta 9 horas y en uso normal (no juegos) solo alcanza las 4 horas, por lo demás estoy satisfecho con la compra.",0
"Stylus isn't working after 3.5 month of use. Otherwise its a decent device for my kid.Update: charger stopped working after approx. 6 months of use. Luckily, laptop is still running. Let's see how long it goes.",0
This laptop provides what it's paid for. I bought it for small simulations in ML and gaming. From gaming perspective there's no limit. The fans are good and not whiny. Especially I suggest playing in gaming mode.,0
"Do not purchase if you have windows compatible hardware, such as printers, that you will want to use with it because they are not compatible. I have very limited needs with a laptop but this could not meet them. I had to look up how to turn on capslock because the keyboard doesn't have a capslock button.",0
Buenísima calidad,0

"My Toshiba died, and my son first recommended a Chromebook. I hated it, so I sent it back. I ordered this one with the Windows 10 OS. I'm not a technie, and don't have much patience with things that don't work, or I don't understand. This is basically like my old one, with a few changes on the keyboard which were easy to get used to. Love it!",0
The laptop looks and works just like a new one. Shipping was quicker than expected and received well packed.,0
This laptop will definitely be worth your money if you don't plan on having a whole gaming set up like a monitor and computer and all of that' if you want something really amazing fast and slick looking buy this laptop its one of my best purchases. I highly recommend this laptop for any person that's starting a gamming set up that's basic and cheap but really efficient and fast and can run every game you could think of and looks realistic its overall one of the best laptops you could own. Get this laptop and you will not be disappointed.,0
IT wont connect to a standard printer. Read and reread instruction on printing carefully. You must connect your printer to some OTHER computer to print. So why buy THIS computer? DO NOT PURCHASE,0
Great package laptop. Battery life is not that great but that is to be expected for a gaming system. I would recommend for someone looking for an entry gaming or work station system.,0
If this would have the correct dwscription I would have given five stars.,0
"Other than the high temperature this laptop can reach I cannot understand the design of the edges, why are they so sharp or was mine not finished. There are 2 sharp edges at both ends of the base facing the user. That's a dangerous flaw.",0
BUYER BEWARE:I received the gl703vm-nh74 instead of the 703 SCAR edition which is a very similar laptop but with a 60hz panel and is worth $300 cheaper. TRIPPLE CHECK your computer and make sure every SINGLE component is correct. I almost didnt look into it but I am so glad I did. I am filing for a replacement of the correct model now and will update when it comes.3/27 update: exchange was not possible because of the cost of the item which is slightly annoying. I started a return for this laptop and will not be buying any newer asus laptops because these fans are wayyyy too loud. going with an eluktronics 1070 laptop instead.,0
"Muy satisfecho con la MacBook Air, muy rápida, cómoda y versátil.",0
"Was excited to have a chromebook. Major flaw was the inability to adjust font size on the screen without making the screen 2x. The fonts on the opening screen and the ip address and tab lines were so tiny you need a magnifying glass. I spent 1 hour with Acer Techs and they were unable to correct. Same with Google. I did get a response on line and the correction to enlarge the fonts made the screen ""landscape"" meaning you had to center all views repeatedly. Sorry Acer, that is to me a glitch I could not live with. Returned it within two days.",0
This thing traveled to the arctic and back with me. Fantastically light and long battery life i have no complaints.,0
"Screen quality was good, and gaming was no problem. However, I disliked the battery life on it. It lasted a good 1-2 hrs gaming and 3-4 using applications (web browsers, zoom, etc). Overall good laptop",0
Does what it advertises.,0
I like the quality. My charger broke very quickly though!! Had to order another which wasn't cool.,0
It’s not a gaming computer and you can’t do most normal things like other laptops it’s more for at home or office laptop.,0
Very good laptop for begginer-mid gamer,0
Very good laptop. I totally recommended.,0
It's really quick and powerful and runs any game I've played flawlessly.,0
"Whenever the laptop enters idle state or the lid is closed for a few minutes, the laptop becomes unresponsive. The screen is black, no keyboard or mouse input is accepted, and the fan makes a surging sound. In order to use the computer, the power button must be held down for 10 seconds to perform a hard reset. This means that every single time I go to use the laptop, it must be first powered down, powered up, rebooted in order to function. I tried restoring factory settings which removed all non-included applications. The issue remained after resetting to factory state.",0
"This laptop will not connect to Microsoft, Windows, or Office.com using a Microsoft business email address, making it worthless for business use. This limitation was not disclosed. We purchase PC’s and laptops so we have an inventory for new employees, thus putting us outside the return window. Amazon Business should not sell non-business products. This will just go in the trash because Amazon does not offer another solution. Do not purchase for business use.",0
Unlike many other manufacturers for a 4k laptop the price is pretty good.,0
This was a good value. It arrived in very clean condition.,0
"the mousepad frequently stops responding/working, which is super annoying.",0
Was fine until it caught on fire last night. It was sitting on the table turned off not plugged in. All of a sudden tons of white smoke starts blowing out of it. Manged to toss it outside before it did too much damage to the house but my lungs are a defferent story.,0
"Good laptop, however giving it a 2 star for false advertisement. This isn't the 2018 edition, its like 2016/2017. I believe the latest version uses the 8th generation intel core. this uses the 7th generation.",0
Love the portability of this. Just getting used to the different processes from former computer.,0
"Everything about is great, and it meets all of my needs; it's lightweight, durable and so far I haven't used it enough at one siting to drain the battery. My only complaint would be the speakers, which are not quite as good as I hoped, but really, no reason why I wouldn't heartily recommend this to anyone.",0
"Absolutely unusable. Bought the laptop for school in August 2022 and writing this review in November 2022. Have never played a single game on the computer, strictly school software - web browser, PowerPoint, word. Laptop is just over 3 months old and the battery dies within 3 hours. Cannot get even half a day of light use from a full charge. I could not imagine if gaming, battery would probably last a max of 15 minutes. Also, 2 screws have fallen out of chassis already. Avoid at all costs, not worth the cheap price for performance unless you can stayed plugged into a wall outlet.",0
Me agradó el teclado retroiluminado.,0
"The screen quality - 144hz 1080p IPS is very bright, crisp and clear.",0
"This laptop has the latest of the hardware which is nice to start with but...1- the build quality is so bad, its cheap plastic that for sure will break soon of whatever kind of use.2-the reason why i returned this item is that the fans kept on for about 95% of the time even when idling, not to mention the high temps on idling as well. Tried everything, windows wise and update but sounds like it was a hardware issue.Was happy with the return anyways because of the poor build quality of this product.Bottom-line, STAY AWAY FROM ASUS.",0
Disappointed. Very cumbersome to use. Using for editing document is terrible. Not compatible with my printer. Won’t download adobe app. Can’t find the book. My documents have disappeared. No right click.,0
Perfect product for the easy computer tasks! It's quick and easy to navigate.It does a lot for it's size!,0
"On time,with google set up",0
"I have zero room for a gaming desktop, so I wanted a laptop. The issue was I needed a budget friendly one that would be worth the money. This one fit the bill perfectly! I got monthly payment options and when I got the laptop it booted up so fast. The screen helps against glare, the refresh rate is fast, and it handles my games smoothly. I edit videos on it and make my animations. It's render time isn't bad and the programs don't slow it. This laptop is noisey - very noisy and the battery life is non-existent. I have to keep it plugged in, but honestly it's a laptop that's running battery consuming programs, so it's expected and not a huge hassle. This is my first good laptop and I regret nothing.",0
"I bought this laptop on the recommendation of the wirecutter. It has not disappointed, even though it has made compromises across the board to save money and weight. The screen is more than adequate for viewing indoors and a little outdoors with indirect light. The track pad was a little scattered at first, but once I disabled 3 and 4 finger gestures it has worked smoothly. The fingerprint reader works flawlessly. Battery life is around 6-7 hours with moderate use. The chassis is strong and feels very premium with metal edges and a glass finish to the track pad. In terms of gaming, I would not expect too much. I have installed steam and actually streamed the screen from my other machine. The computer gets hot fast, but could probably handle gaming on some lower settings. But that's not why you buy this machine. It's light, it's solid and for all day research and portability, this machine is fantastic.",0
This thing was junk.Stopped working twice in a 6 week period.Returned and new one was shipped and that one crashed in a couple weeks too.,0
"Love the Dell Laptop. I got the touchscreen as this is what I had with Lenovo and really liked it (although did not care much for the Lenovo brand as I had many issues with it). Because the screen it is an Infinity Edge Touch, I sometimes am holding the laptop and the screen changes because I accidentally touch the screen. Not a major problem, just takes a little getting use to. Also, sometimes websites are not as sensitive to touch and I end up using the pointer anyway. The screen display is beautiful, the laptop is comparatively light weight. I added the mCover Hard Shell, which added a bit of weight but fits beautifully. Power, speed, etc., are all great. Connectivity is never an issue. I've had Windows10 for sometime now, so no issues for me with that. Very pleased with the overall quality of this computer. Battery life is good, although never quite what they claim. Biggest thing to me is that I can use it as a laptop. My Lenovo got so hot that it was impossible to hold. So far so good on this Dell.",0
Me parece que en desempe?o esta muy cerca de la Acer Nitro 5 del mismo a?o.. pero en acabado de material es claramente mejor. Se calienta un poco pero nada que no se pueda solucionar aumentando la velocidad del enfriamiento o sumandole una base enfriadora.,0

"The keyboard, is great, it feels nice, and the lighting is great.",0
Touch pad takes some getting used to.,0
"after 3 months of lightly use, this computer gave up on me. just died. very disappointed.",0
Your product stinks because it keeps locking me out even though the password is the right one. Why do we have to pay another 10 dollars for a driver update when we pay good money on it,0
"Wonder chromebook, It works great no problem here! I got it for my daughter so that she could do she school work at home during the shutdowns, and no problems hete.",0
"After 45 minutes of gaming this thing gets soo hot, hot, hot. It was burning my fingers.",0
"I love my product, this the 5 stars, but I will just need to critique the company real quick. When I ordered this model, apparently they didn’t have it in stock anymore so they sent me the newest version with no additional cost. Which was great!... But here’s the critique- it was a different color and at first I freaked out because I wasn’t sure if I’d like the Poseidon blue color versus the dark ash color I had preferred and ordered. The company sent Poseidon blue without checking with me first. They sent me an email saying they didn’t have dark ash color anymore and that they could send me the newer (late 2020) Poseidon blue model instead, but I’d have to reply soon. They didn’t wait for my approval and shipped the Poseidon blue color within an hour, even though their initial email said I had up to 3 hours to reply. I’m not angry but something like this could just really be inconvenient.About the laptop:- it’s heavier than I expected and the fan can be a little loud (not THAT loud) here and there. I’m not used to that because my MAC is usually quiet and it very lightweight.-with that said it’s GORGEOUS, sleek looking and works great! So glad I bought it. I will say if you have big hands, this keyboard and touchpad setup may not be for you because the trackpad is relatively small and it’ll feel like your palms can’t rest on the laptop itself. I don’t know if This makes sense but definitely watch the reviews about it! They’re right.",0
"After I got this, I installed Ubuntu Mate on it with no issues at all. Has been my daily travel laptop, replacingmy Chromebook. Haven't had any issues, and am more than happy with my purchase.",0

"The laptop is probably the best to its value as it can get if you are looking at pre-built laptop.Having that mind set, the gaming laptop works great with almost all current games, I run all games like BF1, Doom, Crysis even, the computer kept it performance at 60fps+ (on ultra, it can depends on hot or cold day, of which is another topic I will have.)The laptop can get hot, like magma in just a few minutes of gameplay, but as shown on the control center that MSI have built in, the system are fine, but the heat when gaming for a long time internally is always kept within 60-70 degree F, which is fine, however on the casing, it get extremely hot and you hands will suffer. This is used along with the cooler booster, a setting for its cooler fan to work full time.The fans are loud, like really loud, so if you intend to game, you are forced to wear a headset, which you can't for a long period.OS overview:Windows OS, windows 10 comes with itOffice is not registeredIntel HD graphics card are used in default, so please use nvidia center to set to the 1050 that comes with the laptop, if you use default option, graphic card windows error might be encountered in some game like CSGO, and the crash is fatal to force a restart.1 TB of storage.Do back up and register your laptop with MSI website, the code are entered for you automatically but some code are located beneath the laptopBatter power is about 2 hours on just normal surfing, 1 hour if you game, and 3hr max if you use batter saver, but the manual suggest that you keep the plug in as all time when you use the laptop so I suspect these numbers will change. Though it has a built in Battery calibration of which I have not tried me self.The specific product I receive come with its OS being English, I know some people receive it under Chinese language, but you can change it through some quick googling using your phone if your other computer is long gone.",0
"Touchscreen stopped working and the performance also degraded drastically. Couldn't even run basic CAD software, making the laptop useless for work purposes. HP support is absolutely useless, just telling me to do the same ""fixes"" over and over when they have already failed. Buy this if you've got the money to get a new laptop every year.",0
great for the price.,0
"Very fast start laptop, screen not great but good.",0
The only con I have so far is what it takes to add another hard drive or more RAM,0
"I switched down from a 17.5"" display to this 15"" display, since I have it setup with an external 24"" monitor and external KB and mouse. Much more comfortable for me, and having sold Acer products at Best Buy for several years, I knew it would be a high quality PC!",0
I bought this for my son to take to college. It was suggested by a friend in IT. The only complaint I have is the trackpoint cap was missing and I had to buy a replacement. All in all it is a good value for the money. It is an older laptop and is a little thicker and heavier than the newer models,0
"Less than a week after purchase the keyboard backlights stopped working. Spent hours trying to find a fix. 8 months in the keyboard itself has stopped working. This is a meh laptop. If I could do it all over again, I would spend more money on a quality laptop.",0
Bought this item for my daughter to play roblox on and the game isn’t supported by Chrome OS! Returning. The system itself was nice and would have been a solid choice had it worked for what we needed it. So parents beware!,0
"Considering the screen size, it is easy to lift.",0
"I am satisfied with the refurbished product. It looks brand new.They can do better with battery life, otherwise I am very satisfied",0
"I've had Acer laptops before it's a very good laptop, for home and family use.",0
"I can do so much at once on this awesome computer. def great for work and school. not great for gaming, but you can do a lil.",0
Muy buen producto sin ningún problema hasta ahora,0
Being under 5 pounds makes this laptop very portable and doesn't fatigue your legs over long gaming sessions.,0
Nice chromebook. Really helpful tool for Dungeons and Dragons 😂,0
"Bought this for my mom, she wanted to use a mouse. I gave her one of my old mouse. Where is the usb port? 20 more dollars for an addon for usb ports!, 720 camera still on a 2020 product come one!Everything else is great. wow, woah",0
"Ok it is absolutely amazing!!You can run any game at the highst settingsI played frotnite and Farcry5 paladins and cs:GoIt was at the higest,I played the wither and it war in low side bt it was amazing wite itThe screen is very good it is fullHD and very good.The battery life is a little bit low but you can get 3:30 hours at normal use.",0
NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!! I have purchased 2 of this model first one screen lasts 4 months. The last one screen lasts 20 minutes.NO MORE HP FOR ME,0
the light up led and the difference in color for the MOBA keys it was nice,0
Purchased the laptop for a wonderful young lady and she’s enjoying it immensely,0
"Love this laptop. I will agree that the material used to make the case is an oil magnet, but that's definitely something a little windex and rag can fix. Performance wise this computer is great though. It's handled every game I've thrown it's way, and even lived through the cat walking across it. Just a small complaint about the MSI App not working in the slightest. Rather irritating but I guess i'll live. I also came to the realization that this laptop is infact VR ready!!!",0
Nice lightweight laptop with good speed and easy to use BUT big issue here is I Lost my WiFi connectivity after using it for only 2 months and had to purchase a TP a link to plug in to the USB port In order to get WiFi connectivity back - occasionally the connectivity will come back only to disappear again randomly so I have to keep the TP link plugged in all the time…. This is a huge problem for me as I needed this to work remotely when travelled and have to use WiFi- this needs to be addressed,0
"Just opened the package so I can't speak on the battery life among other things but I was sent a used charging cable. The cord is filthy and it's not dust, it's sticky and has food all on the charging cable. This is disgusting!!!",0
"Feels a bit cheap, but this is a great, affordable tool for my kids online homeworks. Love chromebooks!!!!",0
"I know it’s refurbished but it arrived looking like a beautiful brand new laptop. At first it was slow. I was thinking it’s so pretty, got to get used to it being slow. After all not brand new. But after spending a lot of time updating windows. It came to great speed. Lightweight. Doesn’t have overheating problem. Great screen, contrast, brightness. Love it.",0
"This is one of the best decisions I ever made in terms of selecting a laptop for me. I never have the best of luck with laptops but when I looked at the storage and all the specifications, I knew this was right for me. For anyone looking to play Sims 4 with cc, this is the RIGHT laptop! This is the best I ever had!",0
"A bit heavier than most, but sleek design. Battery life is not quite what was promised. Comfortable keyboard. The biggest issue is having the camera on the bottom of the screen - it looks into my stomach instead of my face. Why?? It makes NO sense. I am an online instructor, and had to buy another camera for webinars.",0
"Llego el mismo dia, es un poco rapida pero se descarga muy rapido la pila",0
"This might be one of the best MacBooks currently in the market, but it has limited functionality compared to Windows PCs and even certain Chromebook features. The MacBook Air has a beautiful screen but no touchscreen support. It also has an excellent trackpad. However, the MacBook doesn't allow you to perform certain basic features without paying for additional software to access them. For example, you can't snap multiple windows next to each other as you simply would on Windows PCs and Chromebooks.",0
its okay just want more access to apps in the app store,0
The previous reviews were very helpful,0
Producto en excelentes condiciones,0
"This laptop has an awesome GPU and processor for the price. So far, the combination of the 10th generation Intel processor, ray tracing GPU, and 144hz monitor, have enabled this laptop to handle the most graphic intensive games and animation programs I have. Will be using this for schoolwork, gaming, animation and video production. I have no doubt it will take any graphics intensive games or processor intensive apps thrown at it, without missing a beat.",0
"I will be updating this review as I use it, but I wanted to give my first impressions.First off, after unboxing and updating, I ran all the standard hardware tests (dead pixel check, keyboard check, cpu/gpu stress tests) and found no issues. That was nice since I was concerned about ordering online with UPS guys tossing it around.For a gaming laptop, it's not super heavy, though it feels more solid than most laptops I've worked on. The low bezel screen looks gorgeous and feels solid. Opening from a corner doesn't feel like I'm torquing it much at all, and it rests easily where I leave it. The trackpad may not feel as luxuriously anti-friction as a Dell XPS, but neither have I complaints. I will say the keys feel much nicer than my old Toshiba. Not surprising as it was half the price.One thing which is nice but unnecessary is the sound. Gamers are likely to use headphones anyway, but I was impressed by the volume. I actually had to shut it down overnight instead of leaving it to run all its updates and restarts because it makes what my gf calls a ""Fruit Ninja"" sound effect when booting up. I find it satisfying, but I'll probably need to silence it from the bios eventually.Speaking of sound, this *is* a gaming laptop, so if you want something to quietly take notes in class... Maybe don't? It's not horrible, but the fans are quite noticeable when it's not idling. This should go without saying, but for the love of Azathoth do not block the vents with a blanket. It's bad form to strangle such a nice computer.It came with a code to get Just Cause 4, so I plan to try that out in the next week and update my review with how it actually performs in game. I started out playing Pokemon Uranium while other things downloaded and I may ironically get sucked into a graphically minimal game first. God I hope the next real Pokemon is more like this... What was I taking about? Oh yeah. For now I'll just say that running FurMark stress test on 1920x1080 res and UHD settings it stabilized at 68 degrees and >80fps.Overall, I think this thing is gorgeous, feels premium, and appears to have solid specs. For reference, I have the 17"" w/ RTX 2060 (6GB), NVMe SSD, and 1x16GB RAM. If you want more storage, I recommend going with that model and filling out the spare bay with a 2TB FireCudda SSHD for $80 rather than upping the price much more for less storage.",0
This laptop is great to use ，The screen is very clear ， It is a good choice for office or playing games 。,0
I love my Acer Chromebook. I bought it for online college and gaming. The color is so vivid and perfect; the picture crystal clear and the sound is Dolby Sound. I am extremely happy with this product and the cost was only $229.00.,0
"I love this product of my new chromebook, this is my first chromebook but love it already and all it's features. Very fast, clean, easy to use an overall a great item to have or even a must have for anyone wanting a light fast laptop on the go or at home. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and not problems at all with it at all nothing is wrong with it. Thanks Amazon and deal arc!",0
"With a Steeleries keyboard, i7 processor and 2070 video card, this is a lot of machine for just a shade under 1500 bucks. The cooling system is certainly better than the Dell G5 I returned to get this machine. Great for the kid's school as well as handles any game she wants to play, without flinching. A little bit better audio (speakers) and this thing gets 5*.",0
"Absolutely perfect for him as he’s not into gaming or anything serious that requires serious hardware. For browsing and such this is great, actually much larger than I expected. Years ago I had one of the first chrome books which was very small, this is the size of a full laptop. Fast opening speed, hardly a difference from my $2400 Alienware r9 opening a google chrome window.",0
"I purchased this from an open box deal at Best Buy a couple years back ($600ish) and I have absolutely zero regrets. I didn’t want to spend $1000 to play World Of Warcraft again and was drawn to this laptop. It’s extremely easy to open up and had SSD/RAM/HDD, apologize if I messed up the acronym….but the only downside to this computer is it came with 8GB RAM. That being said, I played WoW on 8GB for almost 2 years on this bad boy without many hiccups at all. About 6 months ago I went ahead and upgraded to 2x16GB RAM sticks and this thing runs AMAZING. I can stream, play WoW, have multiple browsers open and even another game, yet it still runs amazing. Keep in mind, I open it about every 1-3 months and clean it up with some compressed air (delicately of course). Again, it’s so easy to upgrade this laptop, it’s basically built for it and you’ll understand why after watching an upgrade video on YouTube, that’s exactly what I did. I travel a lot for work and I take this thing with me everywhere. I’m sure it’s been banged around a little bit in my backpack and yet it still runs amazing. I have it hooked up to a triple monitor system and I couldn’t be happier (I have the 17.5” screen model). One more thing to add, the screen quality is BEAUTIFUL. Buy this with a warranty if you can (just in case) and I promise you won’t regret it. This is the ULTIMATE budget gaming laptop, feels absolutely nothing like budget and runs as great as a lot of PCs. Buy now, thank me later.",0
i had a problem with the sdd. Bios didnt recognized it,0
"Got this to replace a failing laptop, and I am very pleased. It's a solid build, but light weight, beautiful screen, and great sound. Seems to handle basic usage and some gaming pretty well. Do occasionally hear the fan/coil whine that some reviews describe, but not often so doesn't bother me. Overall I would recommend!",0
Very frustrated with this device. Wish I never bought it,0
"Absolutely amazing laptop! Runs games with zero lag. I was lucky to get it for $579, and would recommend checking this frequently as it goes super fast at that price.",0
I think is an excellent product!,0
Sets up in seconds. Restarted and scratched with ease. Added users. Should have upgraded to touch screen. But this works as advertised. Quick start up,0
Very easy to set up,0
"Very happy with this laptop. Flawless operation thus far, have had it a week or so.",0
An awesome laptop for a great price. Don't expect any heavy gaming if you are not plugged in. It's essentially a portable desktop.,0
Una de las laptop que compre viene con el disco duro defectuoso y la garantia no aplica en Costa Eica,0
"At first i thought this was a great deal.But upon arrival i noticed that is a very flimsy plastic made laptop.Battery life is not super good apparently.But the most important issue for me is that we ordered a used laptop (very good condition, supposedly only minor cosmetic defects) and received a computer with a broken screen...First time i try to order repackaged from amazon, will not try it again soon.",0
"My son has a nice decent gaming rig, He always wants to play games with me, but I dont use a PC so we cant play anything together. I got this and not only is it fast, it runs games better than his full sized pc can. screen is nice, graphics crips and gets really good framerates in the games we play. I personally do not try to ultra out anything graphics wise and always opt for best quality to performance ratio. This has worked amazingly so far. Battery life is decent for a laptop.Turbo mode makes the fans go pretty loud. During heavy use fans can also get pretty loud. Not much you can do, but what do expect from a powerhouse that is packaged in a small case.RTX3060 graphics make games look amazing. really love this thing. Love the Keyboard and this thing is a beast.Great system, and perfect for being able to game anywhere.",0
The whole keyboard operates smoothly and I like that the mouse pad,0
Wi Fi works when it wants to..I've reinstalled and rest it 2 times and same problem..In 2 or 3 reboot it stops working again ...Screen quality just ok ...Boots fast tho,0
"I needed a 2nd laptop in the house which was mobile. I am so happy I selected this laptop. Fast, light, and every connection needed.",0
"Phenomenal laptop, amazing experience, great for gaming (keep in mind the gpu has 4gb vram), affordable, would highly recommend it.",0
"Honestly this thing is great. Take it out of the box, turn it on, sign in to your Gmail account, and it's like you've been using it for months! Everything syncs and it runs super quick. Not a great primary laptop obviously but it saves me the hassle of lugging my work computer home everyday just to be on email and in Google docs. Also nice to have something at home to browse the web with that isn't a little touch screen. Super impressed. Hoping it lasts me a few years. That's all it would need to get the money's worth really.",0
Great product!,0
It’s gift to my niece on her graduation!,0
"Me parece una nave espacial, la mejor compraa que hice en a?os",0
"I'm giving this laptop 1-star, even though it probably deserves 2 stars, because there are some glaring issues with Razer and their design team that they refuse to address after 7 years of Razer Blades, and it's getting ridiculous at this point.I really thought they'd get it right with all they've learned and this new redesign, but clearly they haven't. I'll give you a rundown of the problems with more detail later.List of issues:- ? key is in the wrong place (so frustrating to type)- Keys with a 2nd function (all f-keys and ?,>,<, etc) don't backlight their secondary function so you can't tell which keys control volume at night- touchpad lockout when typing is terrible. My mouse always jumps around when my palm touches the touchpad while typing- This laptop runs VERY hot. Even just using a web browser causes the palm rest to heat up.- no fingerprint reader for windows sign-on in a $2500 machine- The laptop isn't too heavy for what it is, but the power brick is SO HEAVY. Any weight savings from the thin laptop are lost if you have to carry the brick- Razer proprietary power jack means that replacement/additional adapters will be very expensive ($100)- They keyboard is ok, not great. You'd think for a gaming laptop they'd put a more robust keyboard inside. This one fees like the keyboard on a microsoft surface pro (which is fine, but not great for gaming)- There should be an additional USB 3.0 port on the opposite side to future-proof the machine. Also, the laptop should be able to run off a thunderbolt charger, and just disable the graphics card when doing so.- Fans run audibly even when computer sits at idle- Green Razer logo on back of screen cannot be adjusted (color or brightness). I'm not thrilled about advertising to people that I'm working on a $2500 machine. Razer clearly cares more about their marketing than the potential safety of their users against would-be thieves.- And possibly the biggest issue - THE LAPTOP DOESNT CHARGE IF YOU PLUG IT IN AFTER IT'S BEEN TURNED OFF. Yes, you read that correctly. You must turn on the laptop, then turn it off with the power adapter plugged in, for it to continue charging. Between this and the ? key placement, and the poorly designed keyboard and backlighting, I'd say these flaws are unforgivable in a $2400+ machine from a reputable company with 10+years experience in hardware manufacturing.I'm returning this one and getting a Gigabyte Aero 15x, which I'll also review once I receive it.",0
Perfect small computer. Great for streaming and searching the web. Great product.,0
Works great for my middle school child . not for an office or work place,0
"Touchpad click feature (left click, right click) ceases to work intermittently. Have to press hard to click even though I adjusted the sensitivity to the highest sensitivity option. Sometimes it just doesn't click at all and I have to restart my PC.",0
Used for an evening and the screen stopped working. I kid you not. I did not even get 24 hrs out of it. Live outside the U.S. so I would have to take the loss. Very disappointed. 0/5b Stars,0
I love it. And Its Definitely Worth The Purchase!!???,0
It has a problem with internet connections and going dead all the time. I would give it no Stars,0
"Simple, this laptop is great for the value. (1,399 plus I had the option to pay in 5 installments was a huge deal maker!!!) This would be my second MSI laptop in 5 years (my other one still works perfect I just wanted better specs)Good specs 10th gen i7 with RTX 2070. The SSD is super fast. I also added a 2.5"" Samsung evo 1TB SSD on the SATA drive (highly recommend for more storage).Stays cool enough that I can play for hours (around 80/81 degrees). and that is without using the cool boost. ( I never even turn that thing on)The only thing I will complain, but its not a big deal is the screen can be better ( IPS 3ms, 144hz) and the speakers are not the best honestly I think these are the worst speaker I have ever heard. But on the other side I never need them anyways since I use a headset so not a big deal. What you are paying for this awesome powerhouse speakers should not be a deal breaker.The construction is hard plastic, but it does feel of good quality ( I come from a raider series with aluminum construction). It is also not very heavy, coming in at 15"" screen it is really easy to move around and take anywhere. Battery life is about 2 hours (it does have a big graphics card and rgb lighting, sooooo its going to eat it up fast) overall I would recommend this laptop for any amateur gamer or even for work that requires graphics and a lot of processing.",0
It was a great buy and will HIGHLY RECOMMEND for others.,0
It is fast and capable of handling programs like photoshop (,0
"I am not a computer person, but I use the computer often for work. This is a great computer for my basic needs. Very pleased with my purchase because it is a fast, easy to use, and efficient computer.",0
"good range of price, with all you need for gaming.the keyboard is ok, even of you are using it with external keyboard, it looks amazing.",0
"Great buy. Using it since day one for work. I am a medical interpreter and I work on camera and so far it responds great. The keyboard very comfortable, I also love how light and thin is the laptop. I couldn’t be happier.",0
Parents bought this for my sister and this is perfect for her to start on it's good for light-medium gaming. With school converting to online it's perfect as well. This computer also has good battery life away from the charger while might use with heavy use not so much it's good though. Overall the computer is good for it's current price and an amazing deal.,0
I got a defective item it only works for a couple days then completely stops working like it won't even turn on anymore only lasted 2 weeks or less,0
Great product,0
"Llegó antes del tiempo estimado, buen empaque, la ram está integrada en la MB, pero tiene slot para agregar en físico, SSD de 128 NVME muy rápido, se puede cambiar por uno se mayor capacidad, además de un cadi para agregar un ssd medida 2.5, buena opción de ofimática, excelente precio y buen rendimiento.",0
The glass touchpad is the best i ever experianced in Windows operating system,0
This computer got me through an applied technology degree and a deployment. Excellent computer! The specs aren’t amazing but they’re good enough for me. I am able to play all the games I want and do all my work. It was durable enough to travel along with me on my deployment.,0
I had to send the computer back after spending 2 hours on 4 seperate calls with Asus tech support. The trackpad drivers and firmware needed to be updated. Even the last tech support agent at Asus recommend that I send this back. I did order the Asus Vivobook 14 inch laptop. It is slightly bigger but not by much. The hardware is far better for the price and the screenpad on the Vivobook is awesome.,0
Works great for taking online classes,0
Great laptop if you are nostalgic for 1995,0
I purchased this item for my 80 year old grandma. She really likes it and has found it easy to use.,0
"this thing is literally horrible, ive been grinding on this game and its on roblox and it literally cant run it, even on graphics 1, meaning pretty much no lighting, only a small chunk render meaning you cant see much over the distance, and you still lag so hard, the cooling is literally mediocre, coolboost barely even helps, can run halo infinite but might explode and noone likes halo infinite, so youre better off saving up for a pc. sure this thing is portable but its battery life cant even survive 5 chrome tabs open, so its horrible, sure nitrosense is cool blablah blah but who cares, if its horrible, this kids are going around and literally buying this thinking theyre gonna be the next esports or sumn like you cant even game on this bro, you wanna play valorant? okay u can run valorant any pc can run valorant but if u wanna play valorant go to your local library and steal a pc from there because itll probably run better than this steam can. gaming is literally like asking to borrow your moms work chromebook that has been through hell anf back and sure it has a 1650, okay a 1650 is decent but everything else is literally garbage, everything else is just a poorly choosen scraps to just fill up the name of the item so kids think its so powerful, Please BUY A PC AND BUILD IT, you have fun and learn stuff, think of it as legos, this acer nitro 5 is horrible. i can literally go search in my dads tool box and make a better ""gaming laptop"" obviously thats what they did in this case.",0
Best deal out there on a laptop that can be easily upgraded if needed. Price is a deal.,0
"No decepciona para nada y puede con cualquier juego, lo que me gusta mas es que tiene un botón para poner en modo turbo los ventiladores, puntos malos es que tiene es cuando la pantalla se pone en negro a las esquinas se le llega notar que la luz se escapa y se ve muy horrible en esos aspectos, pero para todo es muy bueno",0
Great computer. Arrived quickly!,0
The price of this gaming laptop is super. I bought it for gaming and work. It is very powerful and quality laptop. I run all AAA games without a problem. Battery does not last long but I did not expected it will last long. I advise you to buy it. Great choice for this money.,0
"Great laptop - When it works.Laptop crashed. Re-boot attempted, operations system not available.Called tech support, got connected 8 times without help.Finally was connected to HP and was literally told they need to trouble shoot. By the time we ""trouble shooted"", the laptop had a black screen error. Then just nothing. $600 went directly to the trash can. Had the laptop for less than 3 month. Never buying an HP again.",0
Hola no sé es escribir en inglés pero esta computadora la quería para regalar y la prendí para probar pasar archivos y solo se reverso sola y no aparece más que la pantalla en negro y la papelería de reciclaje necesito de su ayuda no funciona en nada graciasAlejandro,0
Soooooo slow,0
"Performance is on point for the specs, weight is light, battery life is okay but if you're playing games it should probably be plugged in, It runs somewhat loud and hot when the GPU is in use. I've only had a year of use so far.Biggest problem is the screen dimness, even at max brightness with dynamic adjustments settings turned off the screen cannot be viewed near a source of sunlight. Ideal for basement dwelling grokes with boarded up windows.Another huge issue, is that sometimes when returning from standby it blue screens and has to shut down. Maybe 1 in every 20 times especially if a lot is going on or a game is is running and you have to close it.",0
"This is my first laptop and my first PC in at least a decade so there's a learning process. I'm using it to start working at home. My only issue is I wish the keyboard had a backlight and I wish the letters, etc were darker or thicker etched on the keys.",0
"This is a great laptop however it does not have an internal drive to play DVDs or Blue rays. If one chooses to buy this laptop, Amazon has external DVDs or Blue ray player drives which plug into the USB ports. I do give Amazon support a star rating for helping me.",0
This computer didn't live up to what I hoped for or my expectations. I tried to get by on the cheap. Returned,0
In the middle of trying to resolve an issue with the laptop frequently losing WiFi internet connection whereas our other devices stay connected. Hopeful that we don’t have a lemon. Love the slim lightweight design.,0
I love the touch screen.,0
i have used it for gaming and adobe/affinity design with some video editing and it has been great Very fast and eats anything i throw at it,0
"the quality is top notch and everything feels very ""Rich"" and like it was made with thought.",0
"I was afraid that the smaller size wouldn't suit me, but have been pleasantly surprised. The screen goes almost to the very edge of the laptop and the light weight, especially compared to the 2-in-1 touchscreen model, is so nice.I do not miss not having a touchscreen, as I found I rarely used that feature on my previous laptop. There is not a 10-key keyboard, but the page up/page down, home, and delete keys are very well placed.Overall, quite pleased with the change.",0
Keyboard backlight did not work. Went on line and noted others had the same problem. Keyboard was prime consideration. Returned laptop.Purchased second unit. This one has no issues and works well for what I intended. Vision issue made lighted keyboard a much used accessory. PC functions well.,0
I can't put my password in it said it doesn't recognize. My password I tried to get a new one but I can't . Only had it one day.,0
I loved it,0
I goofed- cant use Excel- only Google Programs. .Screen quality too dim. Miss touch screen. Gave this a shot- not for me.,0
I bought this for personal use. It filled my needs. The only thing I can’t tell you about is durability and reliability. Stay tuned. Price wasn’t bad.,0
as much as I like this laptop at one point I started getting bluescreens telling me something was wrong with it. I resolved the issue but it caused many problems during my homework.,0
"I'll start by saying EVERYTHING but the performance of this laptop is great. I purchased this laptop at at the end of August and it was shipped to my wife in September. I am currently deployed in Eastern Europe with the Army so she shipped it to me. Upon receiving it in October, I noticed from day one the the performance of this laptop was no where near what it should be. I tried everything, to include obvious windows updates, driver updates, bios updates, game updates, etc but none of them worked. I always keep the laptop up to date on everything except for when I try reverting back to older versions. I cant even play games on low settings despite this laptop having the best specs of laptops on the market. I have deleted and re-downloaded games and updates to make sure its not the games and every time it wont work. The problem I am encountering is the laptop randomly lags out of video games every time I try to play. When it does let me play (before lagging out) my FPS rubberbands terribly between 6 and 100 or-so FPS. This is unplayable. the reason I know something must be wrong with the laptop is my previous laptop, which was not a gaming laptop, ran video games better than this one does. I have not once had the experience that youtube reviews have showed of getting 200+ fps in games. I wouldn't even be upset if I just got 100fps in games, but I literally cannot even play before it kicks me out. many times it is the first game after turning it on that it kicks me out of games and continues lagging out after that. Other times its every 5 or so games of rocket league, or every game or two of Warzone or Battlefield 2042. I am deployed away from my family and friends for a year and playing video games was supposed to be the one release from this mess here but I cannot even do that. I believe I probably just received a lemon but it has ruined the gaming laptop experience for me. Hopefully the seller can help resolve this issue",0
The built-in camera and microphone provide excellent quality for videoconferencing and other AV needs.,0
"Ordered 4 for my parents business to have some inexpensive laptops and couldn’t be happier. Super light (way lighter than an iPad with pelican case), super long battery life, ok browsing speed for a great price.I ended up ordering an other one just to keep it at home for whatever...",0
"Garbage.-After windows update, speakers stopped working.-function keys don't work.-load time at boot is atrocious.-load time for chrome is atrocious.Garbage. Returning. HP wasted my time and I'm pissed about it.",0
it is lightweight and versatile.,0
Muy buen producto tanto en performance como en diseño,0
Perfect work and general use,0
"Es un excelente portatil por el precio, cumplió con mis expectativas.Lo que mas destaco es su rapidez y que es ligero, a pesar de ser de 15.6"" es compacto y fácil de transportar.La pantalla anda muy bien, buen brillo y colores.",0
the laptop stays a little warm,0
I absolutely love the ability to swap it around to type/work on a paper then switch to tablet mode while readin,0
144hz refresh rate is awesome for portable gaming,0
I dont think ill buy one of these chrome books ever again .I'm used to being able to do things on a regular windows PC easily .Unless you're doing something VERY BASIC with this computer I'd steer clear for something better. Even a standard cheap laptop.If you need to do things for work or tasks such as uploading/ opening/finding files etc. (Which I considered basic in itself) expect to find frustration from the awkward unfamiliar keyboard placement to just trying to enter information online and it refreshing and not being able to register that the information was imputed correctly.I'd honestly get rid of this if this wasn't my sole computer right now and not having funds for a new one .,0
The notebook stop working after 4 months. Would not recognize SSD boot drive. Added 2nd 1tb drive twice. Remove both & attached to my game desktop & both drive were corrupt. Both are unusable.,0
"Good experience, I am very happy.",0
"I bought this base model Macbook air M2 to replace a 2017 Macbook Pro 13"" with an Intel i5 2.3 and it is somewhat snappier in performance. Menus and webpages open faster. The keyboard has a better feel to it than my 2017 MB Pro. The magsafe charge connector is far better than usb c. The finger print reader is a bonus for logging into APPS and websites. I bought the Starlight colour and glad I did. For those of you who said in your review that you bought startlight colour Mac but got a silver one....you probably got startlight colour. It's very hard to see that there is a hint of gold in the colour until you sit it beside a silver Mac. I bought the base model with 8gb ram and 256 gb HDD because the bulk of my use is web surfing and I don't store many photos or videos on my Mac. Battery life is a lot longer than my 2017 Intel i5 MB Pro. When using this Macbook Air M2 for web surfing, the battery dropped only 10% after 1.5 hours. Overall I'm happy with this MB Air M2 and would recommend this base model for the average user. Buy yourself a nice sleeve or other accessory with the money you save by buying the base vs upgraded M2 Air.",0
The hinges have just enough flexibility to easily convert from laptop to tablet mode.,0
I attempted Windows setup and one of my keys half fell-off.,0
My husband wanted this to use for online gaming because he is bed bound. He is very happy with this purchase. He is able to play World of Warcraft on it with no problem.,0
My son loves it. It does everything he wanted from his reviews.,0
I'm not an expert typist and would like to be able to see the keyboard better when it is light out.The mouse pad is so sensitive I often wind up in places I never intended to be.,0
"I like this chromebook a lot. It is very helpful and it is very fast. The battery will last a full day or two so it’s very good for a middle school student. The only thing is that it does’t have too much storage room. I don’t think 16 GB is enough. I think at least 20 GB or more. Otherwise, it’s great.",0
"The laptop is great and does whatever it's designed to do. However, a few weeks after receiving the laptop, the screen starts to flicker. I've called ASUS Support a couple of times, they walked me through how to fix it. Unfortunately, the fix didn't work. The screen still flickers, not all the time but most of the time, enough to drive me crazy.ASUS is saying that I can send the laptop to them for fixing, but that's a lot of work and I would be without a laptop for at least a few weeks, not to mention the cost of shipping.I just want to add that since I unplugged my second monitor from the laptop, the screen has stopped flickering, and that was about 2-3 weeks ago. I did plug my second monitor onto the laptop the other day and the flickering has NOT returned. I'm so happy now.",0
I like the 17'' screen and the back lit keyboard all for $499 great deal..,0
"It just came in and I have not had the time to install - Idid open the box and looked at it. It looks very comfortable to me, smaller than the one I am using now. Which is what I wanted,",0
Its not touch screen and the speakers play very soft but overall it good for gaming and online classes.,0
"I really like the new design. It looks like a workstation more than a gaming laptop!I'm gonna try and keep this short:PROS:- build quality is excellent,- specs are insane,- 2.5kg and the dimensions make it really portable,- screen is amazing! 144Hz and 300nits.- Ryzen 7 4800H...- GTX 1660ti is great for video editing and gaming!- laptop feels premium!CONS:- speakers are mediocre. Volume is decent but the sound quality is ok.-battery is really bad...less that 4 hours.- there is no international warranty (now this is Lenovo fault)!To be honest, this laptop is best buy at this price (999$). I'm really glad I bought it!Edit:There is a lot of problems with Linux...I actually thought Lenovo was the best with open source drivers and support for Linux...I was wrong.I can't run Linux, I can't have warranty in my own country, I can't have normal battery life. I guess I'll return it!Edit 2:I have random freezes. It just stops responding while doing random stuff. Returning it!",0
J'adore ce petit laptop. compact et très pratique!,0
Great Unit - Very Happy - But volume is now so low - can hardly no longer hear it,0
"We use this primarily for Steam games, and it's been an excellent investment. It can run all of the games we want really smoothly, no lag, and the screen is beautiful. It's responsive and it looks nice. The battery life isn't great, and the battery pack gets hot if you have it plugged in while you're playing. Also the laptop itself runs hot while you're playing, so the fan gets loud. For the price, though, and the performance, those are minor things to me.",0
"Overall, a very good quality, good looking, and good performance laptop for the price with acceptable fan noise. That said, the 4gb v-ram is the biggest blow to it's performance as some newer you intensive titles struggle at the highest settings. keep in mind that it isn't the most portable and light weight of laptops, making it a bit more difficult for always having it in you bag.",0
"Very good laptop. Fast, responsive and up to date.",0
The battery life is decent. I also don’t have much on it yet since it’s still new but i must say it has been holding a great charge. It also was more on the less expensive side to be brand new 2022! I’m loving it so far !,0
Was a gift to a family member. Great product.,0
Battery life is excellent.,0
This unit work as expected,0
"I was truly very satisfied with my purchase it was a very good laptop for the price but a few months in its useless nothing but a paperweight. A few months after purchase it constantly over heats I have not been able to using it for a few weeks now as soon as I plug it in it automatically gets very hot almsot towards a painful heat level I’ve let it sit unplugged for a few days and I plugged it back in and 10 mins later scorching hot again, very disappointing I wouldn’t recommend this purchase if you don’t want to waste money",0
"The laptop is very thin and professional looking. It resumes from sleeo quickly. The battery life is reasonable when not gaming, but I keep it plugged in most of the time. The bloatware from Asus can be a bit irritating until you turn off all the notifications that will interrupt everything you do. The graphics card is powerful enough to handle many games and they run well streaming to my TV. Overall worth the money to get a nice, lightweight computer than can run games when needed.",0
It's probably a 5. First lap top.,0
Pretty dang slow,0
To hard to upload programs. It does have great battery life.,0
The display is not as bright as the previous Acer laptop that I own,0
it is a really nice laptop for the price. It does have the option the change the colors on the keyboard.,0
Meet my expectations,0
it never got past the initial setup.,0
"I took the best care of my laptop, making sure that it was always secure, never dropped, not even scratched, and I only downloaded software that was from verified corporations such as Steam. After only running this computer for 7 days and over-clocking it when it was tanking on frames, the computer would just freak out and shut down permanently. If you try to turn it back on, it simply just restarts over and over again within a 1-3 second time-frame without giving you any chance at all to change anything or modify it. I can assure you that I didn't leave this laptop on for long periods of time, and at most gamed for 6 hours in one day. This has happened to me on multiple occasions and now I have to get the laptop fixed because it won't even start up anymore. Please if you're looking for a good computer, I beg you not to buy this version. It's horrible and it tanks to run good games like COD B03 Zombies. I suggest buying the $1450 version of this computer, as it has a better graphics card, more RAM, and just overall a better computer. Do not waste your money on this, because I promise you it's an extremely mid-tier computer that will tank to run a lot of good games. If you're looking only to run games like L4D2 and other low-graphics games like that, then I can assure you that this computer is for you. Other than that, I highly advise you get an upgrade because it'll save you from wasting your money. I hope this helped, and let me know if other buyers have encountered the same issue.",0
Very happy with purchase,0
"I love this laptop. It replaced an Acer aspire 5 slim, which was quite heavy, and had a battery that lasted five hours. In power saver mode. It was only two years old and rarely used until I started a new job and school. I had my MacBook going from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. Because I have an iPhone, I can make calls and send texts with it. My iPad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. The mac doesn’t skip a beat- I can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. It’s not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. The Mac OS not supporting steam titles thing isn’t a huge deal- If I want a gaming machine, I have a desktop. For getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone. My one gripe is lack of USB-A ports, but I’ll buy an adapter and move on with my life. Overall, try a MacBook Air… You’ll like it. UPDATE: I found a program called Parsec and so long as my Mac has a stable WiFi connection, I can remote into my desktop and use steam along with everything else.",0
Great screen，great quality，battery life not too good,0
"I purchased this laptop on Jun 13th and it was delivered on Jun 15th, which is the day warranty should start. HP sent a mail asking for feedback mail, in which it recognizes the purchase date to be around Jun 15th. However, when we check the warranty date, it starts on Nov 25th, 2021 (and ends warranty support Dec 29th, 2022)We have tried reaching HP seller support twice to fix this, but they have still not fixed the warranty start date.",0
This is a great laptop that is thin and durable. I would recommend a skin or case due to how lightweight it is!,0
This is a Christmas gift for my husband so it hasn't been used yet. From looking at it though - it looks very well made - good quality and really slim/compact. I love it so far!,0
Would give 4.5 if I could. I love the computer just had to replace the charger 3 times. It keeps breaking… that’s the only con I have.,0
Looks good. Good deal for the price. S-mode can be upgraded to Windows 10 home with no costs,0
Super budget friendly laptop that does what it says it does.,0
"This computer has had no issues running any games, been playing the new call of duty at about 80-90 fps without changing any graphics settings. Also have been using the computer for a ton of school work and haven't noticed any issues. If it wasn't for the computer getting hot really easily (It's about 80 degrees when gaming), and being super loud with its fans, then I would give this computer 5 stars. The battery life is horrendous only about 3 hours, but I am always near a plug so it doesn't bother me. The only thing that I don't know why it occurs and it could be my internet, but every now and then videos/spotify won't work and I have to restart the computer. Again not big issues and things that don't bother me, but it could bother others.",0
"Instead of admitting they are knowingly selling bad harddrives, they argue about they can't help hard drive failure.",0
This is a great product. I have to get a little use to using the google docs instead of Office products. all in all a great little computer and very light,0
"the display is bright, crisp and clean.",0
Love it!,0
"El equipo presenta muy buen equilibrio en rendimiento y precio. Además, es un portátil ligero, con una pantalla de buen tama?o y teclado completo.Si bien el almacenamiento y la memoria son reducidos, existe la posibilidad de ampliarlos sin demasiada dificultad, con la ventaja de contar con un procesador de última generación. Buen sonido y muy buena cámara; para el uso que lo compramos (estudios) es una excelente opción.",0
"This MBA is fan-TAS-tic to use. It can run unplugged all day. The speaker is sufficiently loud, and the hi-rez screen is eye-popping.But using a Mac laptop's USB-C port for power, after more than a decade of Mag-Safe bliss, is darn-near CRIMINAL. Thankfully, we still have capitalism, and there are a number of 3rd-party workaround devices that mimic Mag-Safe to a greater-or-lesser degree. Sigh.",0
La mejor máquina portatil para gamers. Funciona perfecto. Muy silenciosa.,0
This was very easy to set up and I'm glad my son can now have access to additional learning opportunities on-line that weren't previously available to him. The $200 price tag was well worth the expense.,0
"Love this laptop. It’s super fast and handles anything I throw at it like a champ. There are a couple things that I’ve noticed though. It does run rather hot, not dangerously hot, but it does get uncomfortable just sitting in my lap while I’m running basically any game. The 500 Gb storage is simply not enough, especially if you have a large gaming library like I do. That being said, I manage all my games via a cloud library and with that fast download speeds, there’s really no need to keep all the games downloaded. All in all, I love this laptop.",0
I really like the keyboard and the track pad.,0
"When I get the device out of the box while setting it up I noticed the bottom was not secure, but outside of that it is a nice computer.",0
"Glitch-tastic. I kept getting boot loops and kernel panics due to page faults - you can read that as ""faulty RAM or motherboard components."" This is fresh out of the box, even after reflashing. Sending back to Amazon for a replacement, but if the replacement has issues it looks like a horrible run.",0
"Although no optical drive this suits my needs for surfing the web, documents and portability.",0
We bought this for our daughter. She is very happy with it. It is lighweight and serves all of her internet and school needs.,0
"Cool and quiet. Messed around lightroom, light gaming, web browsing. So far so good.",0
Some amazing things:- the light is amazing- the ability to use your phone camera as an alternative- 2-in-1 number pad + touchpad- half transparent case,0
Can’t beat the cost! I bought 2 of these for my kids. I don’t think they are good for gaming but are good for trolling the internet.,0
"I really enjoy this laptop, It's super quick. Loads into windows under 4 seconds.I added a ""Kingston Technology HyperX Impact 8GB 2666MHz DDR4 CL15 260-Pin SODIMM Laptop Memory (HX426S15IB2/8)"" ram module for making the Ram 16GB total, this will work best with the shared GPU memory.YOU WILL NEED MORE RAM FOR HEAVIER GAMESThe onboard GPU memory is shared with your ram when in gaming mode.I played space engineers, which requires around 5GB of VRAM for medium gameplay, it leaked into my actual ram, but with the hyperx upgrade there was only slight FPS drops but not enough to affect gameplay. Ram is important.I recommend windows 10 Pro 1909, don't use 2004 on this laptop will die really quick in Win 10 2004. Lasted about 3 hours under full load, whist 1909 lasted around 7 hours under full load, close to expected battery life.The Intel CPU Turbos to 3.98 Ghz while plugged in, if you set it that way.If you plan to install linux, the NVME will not be detected at boot time, to fix this, head to bios and on the first tab or second tab press ""CTRL"" + ""S"" to bring up a setting and change and disable intel optane firmware to use nvme in linux, as when you boot a non windows OS, the nvme will be placed into sleep mode.As for a extra nvme slot, i picked up ""Western Digital 250GB WD Blue SN550 NVMe Internal SSD - Gen3 x4 PCIe 8Gb/s, M.2 2280, 3D NAND, Up to 2,400 MB/s - WDS250G2B0C"" from many other users, as this will take full advantage of the laptops firmware and hardware. You can pick higher space storage, but as a light gamer, this was enough for me.As for the 2.5"" drive, i picked up a ""ST1000LM024 HN-m101Mbb"" It's a 1TB Mechanical Drive with decent write and read speeds for lighter games, and game storage. Granted it is slower, but for this laptop its perfect and I can get full R/W speeds that were advertised. If you notice, it's the same drive inside the XBox 1 - 1st Gen, so You can game on it as well, not as fast load times, but its fast enough to still enjoy a game.Besides the battery life, this is a really good laptop if you go out to a friends house for a night and do some moderate gaming like a LAN party, or a small road trip, or sitting out side for a few hours.I do not recommend taking this on a flight. Unless you get an extra battery.As of this message, I am using this as my main pc, and quite enjoy it, the Intel i5v9 is great and the GTX 1650 plays most games on Medium/High at 50/60fps.Also another note to stay on 1909, is that windows f--ked up the NVIDIA auto select method for Intel Graphics and GPU graphics, so some games will default to intel CPU instead of NVIDIA.Also, This laptop can play COD: Cold War at High settings with 48/55fps under heavy scenes and a perfect 60fps on normal fighting.",0
keyboard backlight is too low,0
This PC has fast startup and a lighted keyboard which is great in low light situations. This is my 2nd Asus because I was told they were one of the best PC's to buy. You won't go wrong by getting this one. I am very satisfied and the price was reasonable too! Great buy.,0
"This was so disappointing! The box was dirty, the seal was broken, all the tags and stickers were ripped apart, and there were huge black marks all across the box. The info and the reviews are super misleading, I do not recommend this at all!!!!",0
Going into the laptop it work perfectly for school. Gaming isn’t the best but still does very well with triple A titled games,0
"I love that this is just like the one my granddaughter uses at school. This makes it easy for her to interface with school apps that are available for home use. This Chrome book is lightweight, yet sturdy enough for a ten-year-old. She is loving it.",0
"Perfect PC for my teen - light and durable for school, and powerful enough to get through everything he is using it for, as well are normal gaming use (Roblox, Minecraft etc).The keyboard is well laid out and the backlit feature is awesome, and the connectivity is good too - the large number of ports (USB C and A, HDMI and Ethernet, 3.5mm Headphone) are good to have, and the Bluetooth and WIFI seems snappy and stable as well.Possibly, only criticism is that the audio quality from the internal speakers is awful - when compared by my old MBP at least - but using a Bluetooth or wired speaker or headset means you can avoid that anyway.",0
"This product was used by me as a replacement desktop cause it was way less expensive and movable.For the games I play which really aren't huge name titles, it works amazingly well. When the fans kick in, it really doesn't change the volume that much. Two things I'm kind of disappointed about was the storage and battery life. Because I use this as a replacement and not a daily driver for traveling, I keep the laptop plugged in and it works great. However, as soon as you remove the laptop from the power brick, you immediately notice how fast the battery drains. The other thing was storage. This version only has 256 gigabytes of SSD which as it turns out, isn't a whole lot. You can either get a different model for more with more overall storage, or you can buy this one and pay just for a cheap hard drive with storage space which is what I did. Speaking of, getting the back cover off is a pain, but the computer is great for upgrading",0
Slow but works,0
"The fan also blasts much louder than any other laptop I’ve used, even with just a browser and a few tabs open, and it gets pretty hot.",0
"unzipping large files (e.g. gzipped 4GB Linux isos, etc.) is extremely fast, and moving such files to and from a 3.1 USB pendrive is jaw-dropping to someone who remembers using 8MB USB 1.0 pendrives.",0
"Just what I was looking for. Easy to use, full featured, reasonably fast (for web browsing and other basic to mid-level tasks). Seller did a nice job with refurbish.",0
"It has great potential but the screen was damaged, it has a bright spot which is visible with white background and not so visible when the screen is dark. Screen is what makes a portable book, a great device. This is a broken device.Update on March 2019, the computer stopped working and is not turning on.",0
Perfection!!,0
"It should have been a sign when I first bought it and the sound was quiet, the screen was naturally dark, and the battery life was seriously 2 hours. Couldn’t even make it through all my zoom classes without being plugged in.Here I am, 11 months later, and the mouse pad stopped working WHILE I WAS USING IT!! I didn’t think much about it and thought it would just go away, two months later, it still has not. Just today I noticed my touch to get in stopped working, so I finally called tech-support thinking they would help me and either offer a refund because I’m within a year, or tell me the location of a place I can bring my computer to get it fixed. Nope. It took over half an hour for them just to tell me that it’ll cost me $80 for them to try to do something that may not even work. Definitely not worth the money, go put it towards something more reliable. So disappointed.",0
My grandson loves it for school. It was a great deal.,0
"I am surprised at how easy it was to set up this laptop and use windows 11. I am also amazed at how fast this unit starts and stops. Very fast. Great screen and backlit keyboard. Update; After using this unit longer, I fired up my old one to compare and WOW. This HP is like a rocket compared to a bicycle during every process",0
Battery life is awful,0
excelente producto,0
"Love the Chromebook, no issues at all.",0
"This is the worst piece of garbage I've ever bought. If it wasn't such a hassle to send back, I would. So therefore I'm going to take a sledgehammer to it. Extremely dissatisfied!!!!",0
"A little heavy for my preference. It does have a bigger screen, so it makes up for it.Also, it seems like is large enough to have a ten key, but they didn't include it.Everything else about this computer is awesome. It's fast and very comfortable to type on and runs programs without issues. Not too much bloatware either.I'd recommend it.",0
The battery life has been pretty good,0
Fully patched and updated with Asus' drivers (which also had very bad installers) and still crashed intermittently.,0
"I had to get a smaller laptop for school and found this on Amazon. Great price, light to carry in my bag, and long battery life.",0
My son upgraded his old gtx 1050 to this and he is happy with it. Not bad for the price.,0
Exactly what I needed for work. Lightweight and nice screen,0
"Bought this chromebook at xmas time to replace our ageing Windows based laptop. First let me say, I don't miss Windows at all. This machine is very fast and handles almost everything we needed windows. My main concern was the use of Turbo Tax software that I used to install locally on the windows laptop. I solved the issue by using Turbo Tax online version using the chrome browser. I do have simple tax requirements and this worked out fine.If you are considering a Chromebook, do yourself a favor and get the 4 gig ram version. Yes, more money, but well worth it. I have installed a program called ""Crouton"" which allows you to install ""Ubuntu"" Linux which will run in a ""Chrome"" browser tab. This allows you to run any Linux based programs on the Chromebook.Battery life is very good also, depending on the usage level. 6-8 hours is normal in my case. The ""full"" HD resolution of this model is also well worth the extra cost vs a lower cost unit with the less than ""full"" resolution. (768i vs 1080i)I did a lot of research into Chromebooks before buying this HP model and am glad I did. I was able to buy this at xmas on sale for $229.00. The next time this model goes down to that price level, I may buy a second one.",0
"I’ve been using the laptop since March and I can happily report that I have never had an issue with it. It was meant to be used as a desktop laptop since it is pretty heavy to travel with. Not that you couldn’t travel with it, but it would be too heavy for me to lug around. The laptop is on for over 8 hours a day and I never had an issue with it. It is the perfect laptop for work and play. The hubby does all the gaming on it and has absolutely no complaints. The display quality is amazing and I love the RGB lighting while I work at 5am. The happy colors are appreciated. I keep it elevated on a laptop stand with holes to let it breath so it doesn’t overheat and last me a VERY LONG time! I would have loved more USB ports, but that’s ok. It’s a beast for playing games so if you're a gamer you’re going to love it! I’m not going to get geeky and relist everything it has as you can see it for yourself in the description. Don’t waste your money on brand name laptops, this beast can run with the big boys!",0
"Very happy with the performance for the price. Screen is crystal clear, after learning the operation of Chromebook I love this product.",0
"I've had this laptop for about a week and so far it's great, and runs all of my games flawlessly. Typically over 100 FPS on major games on high settings, it definitely utilizes the 144hz screen. I usually find flaws in anything I purchase, but this checks all of my boxes. The only thing I'll mention is the battery life is not great but that's you get when you purchase a laptop with a mobile 2070. This laptop does have the mobile 2070 which has the same specs as the full size 2070 just with lower power draw so slightly lower clocks, much better than a max-q variant. I do however believe they could've gotten a slightly larger battery in here but all in all this laptop is everything I was looking for. The temps on the i7 do hover around 90 C while gaming without the fan boost on (80-85 with fan boost on) but I haven't experienced thermal throttling while boosting the fans. This is my first gaming laptop and I am very happy with my purchase, if any issues arise I will update here.",0
Only think I like better on my older Lenovo is that the caps lock and number lock keys light up. I have had an occasional problem with the number pad not working even with lock on in this Sager but otherwise I am pleased with the laptop. I have actually not had time to try it out in a game yet. I have not found anything wrong with it unlike a Dell I bought and immediately returned. This is my 2nd sager and the older one still works great just is outdated. Sager and Lenovo are the only brands that work good for me right out of the box.,0
i give 5 rating after using it for 1 week. I would love to have thisDesign:Its gives stunning look when everyone speaks about midnight i was attracted to starlight due to contrast with black keyboard .Display is super cool and i worked more than 6 hours continuously but i dont feel eye strain or heating issuesSpeed: When i open the mac it starts immediately in a second. It has good ram i brought 512 gb ram it has great speed in workingProcessor: i dont do programming so no comments on thatIts definitely a choice if you are planning to buy it as a school or paper based work .,0
"This was a Christmas present for my wire, she was very happy with it.",0
"Cost is less than half my high end laptops, and this is more convenient, lighter, more battery power, and almost as good graphic performance.",0
"I have ordered 2 of these laptops and both have the same problem -- they don't charge. The charging light (amber) goes on for 1 second and then turns off. What a shame. After resetting the battery via the power button as suggested in the Acer forum, the problem persists. Apparently this a known issue with the Acer 515-56 models. I am surprised Acer is allowed to sell a defective model like this. Save yourself the trouble of having to send it back and wait 2 weeks for a refund from Amazon",0
"Update: 6months into having this laptop the screen hinge cracked. I never dropped it, never mishandled it. Within a week it was completely parted. Do with this information as you please.Customer Service was hard to contact and pretty much useless.",0
"I travel a ton for work, but cannot always use my work laptop for things like shopping and games. This notebook is lightweight, boots up super fast, and has not bogged or slowed at any number of task I have thrown at it. I have played some online games while listening to music and browsing facebook and there were no signs of slowing or issues. It was surprisingly tough and the battery has lasted me for 2 full days of use. From a toughness standpoint, I'll admit, I dropped it out of a laptop bag and it did quite well with only minimal damage so that was very impressive. I have added some storage space via HDD and found it very easy to do with minimal tools. The Bluetooth works very well, as well - have used this for movies on the plane ride and it worked flawlessly. This is a great general use laptop and I would highly recommend it.",0
it's been amazing and easy to use so far,0
"This product is light weight, easy to carry, and the performance is great!",0
The best of both worlds between a desire for a tablet and a desire for a laptop comes with the purchase of a 2-in-1 laptop.,0
"Can play new games with the highest settings without issues. Can handle various demanding programs simultaneously (such as Bloomberg and Excel, statistical or coding programs, and DAWs like Ableton Live) without overheating and crashing. The overall build is sturdy - the screen and keys aren't flimsy or delicate. It has all the features that other laptops typically priced around $1800+ currently have. The only con so far is that the built-in speakers don't sound very good, but having a good pair of headphones or external speakers should fix that.",0
great build quality and amazing keyboard and lighting,0
I love it. Good stuff,0
My daughter loves her new laptop!,0
I purchased this for my husband for his birthday. He still has his other laptop but I noticed he usually reaches for the chromebook. It's fast and does everything he needs it to do. I think I've converted him to a chromebook person like me.,0
Wi-Fi failed after less than seven months of use.,0
It makes productivity apps like Excel and Onenote run without a flicker of disturbance and will run every game I have on high settings,0
1st version had unacceptable backlight bleed in the bottom corners.,0
"Have had the laptop a few months now and works great for streaming movies, surfing the web, simple graphic games, and everything I need it for. Runs fast and so far it’s been well worth the buy.",0
This computer is crap. Worst 170 dollars I ever spent.,0
Androidアプリがインストールできる点で高評価。容量も普通で、このChromebookならではの特徴というものはありません。他の方のレビューにもある通り、耐久性はあまり期待できないかもしれません。とはいえ、値段が安いしAndroidアプリが使えるから満足です。※対応していないアプリもありますちなみにタッチスクリーンでは無いのでアプリによっては操作がキビシイ…。Chromebookを初めて買う人なら満足できると思います。,0
Product is of good quality.,0
"La laptop, es realmente buena, tal y como se muestra en la descripción.El procesador y el SDD hacen que sea un maravilla el utilizarla con windows 11. (si se instala windows 10 los drivers, dejan de funcionar), pero realmente vale la pena, el almacenamiento es limitado, si no se instalaran juegos pesado o muchos esto no seria un tema.La velocidad con la que abre los programas es increíble... android studio, visual studio emuladores de android, maquinas virtuales y demás cosas para programar es increíble la forma en que los abre y compila.Aplicaciones normales que mas puedo decir al instante.La velocidad con la que se inicia la computadora no es de mas de 13segundos en iniciar colocar contrase?a y ya estar manipulando el sistema.Las únicas pegas que le daría al equipo son justo el almacenamiento, y que la salida de aire del ventilador es justo por debajo de la pantalla, eso me causa cierto temor a que se da?e con el tiempo la pantalla.",0
"I liked that the Chromebook looked promising, however I cannot download/upload much needed online pages like edvance360 or connectmath.com. I need to send this back, and select a more appropriate laptop, cost effective, device. Thanks for asking.",0
"GOOD: This laptop is a beast! A great entry level gaming laptop. It's a thrill to have the AMD Ryzen 7 processor, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB solid state HD. Laptop construction feels solid, and so far no mechanical or software issues. Windows 10 Home setup default, with very minimal bloatware included. Very fast boot time. In general this equipment takes very little time to get used to.MEH: While the Lenovo Legion 5 may be a great entry level gaming machine, I would NOT recommend this laptop for daily use.For one thing, this device costs about $200 more than equivalent non-gaming laptops, including several models from Lenovo. It seems to be only the processor and video quality that you are paying extra for. If you want a laptop for something other than gaming, there are other options.The power cord is an unusual proprietary 230W brick. And you had better buy a second one, because this laptop is not compatible with any docking station that will power the laptop. Yes, you can hook up a USB-C generic docking station, but you'll still need to also plug into your power cord. And by the way, that extra power cord will set you back at least $76. (This is not an expense you'd have to pay if you purchase a laptop that powers by USB-C. I really wish I had considered this.)MISC: As mentioned, the construction of this laptop is solid, and that includes the keyboard and palm rest. But overall this shell seems particularly attractive to dust and smudges. If you plan to travel with your new Legion 5 laptop, be sure to bring some dust cloths.And you may not want to travel with this beast, as it's quite heavy.OVERALL: I wish I had done more research before buying this laptop. It's solid, and should perform well. But also limited for daily use. I'm particularly disappointed at the expensive proprietary charging cable and the lack of a compatible docking station.",0
This is terrible . Ordered and was dead out of box. New replacement is also not working ! How does this happen twice ??,0
"I really like this laptop, I bought it a year ago and it has been working perfectly since then.",0
If you hold it by the base near the touch pad the space bar will press without clicking it which can be annoying especially watching videos. Other than that it's pretty good,0
Good buy however comes with window 10 s and doesn't allow you to install your own applications I had to upgrade to a higher version to be able to install products.,0
The screen quality is pretty good,0
Like it so far. Does what I need a too. I'm sure has way more features than I even know of.,0
"We bought this same Dell computer directly through Dell last May. Within 5 months it would not work. Spent hours on the phone with Dell being transferred to different departments, getting disconnected and receiving misinformation. They sent 2 techs out to fix, but they could not and were eventually ""escalated"" to their highest level of service who were just as terrible as the rest. We requested a replacement or a refund but the Dell representatives said they never do that. So we finally took a recommendation we saw on line and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau in Texas, where they are headquartered. And it worked!! We got a full refund. We assumed that the unit we purchased was just a lemon as I own a Dell and it has worked well for years. So we bought the same computer, this time through Amazon. And within a couple of months, it began glitching and is virtually unusable. We have not called Dell at this point as it just began today. But we are done with Dell as their customer service is deplorable. We will be returning and buying a different computer.",0
"For the price it works well, good for what I need it for in a computer.",0
PROS:Great Value/price ratioI have enjoyed used it and performance is great- fast and seamless use of windows.CONS:Touchscreen stopped working suddenly after 7 monthsLenovo service took 1 month to service the computer- terrible auto service web siteUpdate: Even though Lenovo replaced the screen- it failed again after 2 months- now out of warranty and using as a laptop without the touchscreen- frustrating. Not buying Lenovo again.The power connection and headphone connections are next to each other. Way too easy to connect your headphones to the power connectorOn/Off bottom on the side- when handling the computer easy to turn it off inadvertentlyToo much fan noise- can get hot (unlike Yoga 710),0
"My family needed a multi-purpose laptop and Acer's Nitro 5 fits the bill. It's design is sleek (although it is fairly big) and it looks really nice with the red backlit keyboard. Although, I find a backlit keyboard is an unnecessary battery drain. It's simple to toggle the keyboard light off and on. The screen resolution is great for our needs. I've been doing telework since Covid-19 and I don't need tons of bells and whistles, just something reliable and safe. Norton Antivirus is included on the Nitro 5. It is easily upgradeable if you need more memory. Battery life is good (especially if you turn off the back light).My children need a computer for home-schoolwork and the Nitro 5 fits the bill for them as well. I realize this is marketed as a gaming laptop, and we may or may not use it for gaming. It's a good beginner gamer laptop and at this price point, it has been a good value for us. It only needed a Microsoft account to activate and use and it was ready to go right away.",0
It is exactly everything I wanted and I am so happy with my purchase!! I will definitely order again from this company!!,0
Great product! Love it,0
"This low-end MacBook Air performs incredibly. It handles Lightroom and Photoshop like it's nothing. I can't believe the battery life as well - it'll run all day. I don't know how Apple did it, but they did. Very satisfied with this laptop.",0
Great laptop for all ages. I get annoyed when people say these are only for kids. I'm 30 and bought this for myself while I'm in school. All I do is browse the internet myself anyway. All my other media is on my Android phone. It's a great buy for us adults who are going back to school or just people who use the internet.,0
"Good budget laptop. For a price like this, you can do schoolwork and play casual games. But beware when playing games on this as it can get hot quickly.",0
Had to purchase a new laptop and purchased the software from Best buy. works great and has a camera.,0
this laptop is a upgrade to the acer nitro 5 laptop i got back in December it just couldnt cut it for gaming while this thing has been running quite well since i got it my games for the most part have been running fine though i would recommend upgrading ram to 32gb depending on the games you play as some game configurations wont leave you enough ram but for the most part ive been quite happy with the laptop ive only had it for about 10 days so far,0
Slow. As. Hell.,0
"Excellent value for money gaming laptop. You cannot beat it for the price. I researched for a solid 3-4 weeks and I kept coming back to this one. Save yourself some time and just get it.Only complaints are fairly in line with the other reviews - speakers are tinny, and fans are loud when gaming - but these caveats are easily solved with a set of headphones which most gamers are using anyway. Yes the power port is in an annoying spot, but you get use to it and I get the feeling it was put there in order to not compromise the cooling system. (I've not yet opened up the back so cannot confirm this). These are the only reasons I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.The screen is amazing and rgb keyboard is ridiculously configurable, though I ended up just using a solid colour its nice that you can change it if you want to and adapt it differently for games.Performance wise, its a beast. Happily runs my entire library on high everything and I feel it will for at least a few years - there are plenty of guides around for undervolting if temperatures get high, but mine has been okay out of the box so far.",0
I did not like to be followed up with warnings that the drivers were dying so Microsoft had to update the computer which really ended up being scammers trying to wipe out our account. The computer works perfectly.,0
"It was not a touch screen. It never really performed all that great. The clock was off from day one which could mean the hard drive was going bad when I purchased it.It's the risk you take when buying a used computer. If you buy one of these, just save to the cloud and/or backup often as I did.",0
"good laptop when it comes to specs, design and software. Problem is that the fans run all the time and there are no controls to prevent this. Dell has removed the windows power plan control settings that influence CPU load and fan control in their own app, which can be configured to ""quite mode"" but fans are still running all the time.",0
"This laptop has pretty much everything I was looking for. It boots up very quickly, processes quickly, and it lightweight. The battery life is pretty great. My only issue is with the touchpad. It can be sensitive and aggravating sometimes, probably because the left and right-click buttons are part of the touchpad.",0
"Great for gaming, runs just about anything at max graphics settings without issues. The RTX 3060 never struggles with temperature. However, under heavy load, the Intel i5-12500H does. It regularly reaches 180°F and sometimes higher, even with the fans at full blast. I got a cooling pad for it which definitely helps bring that CPU temp down a little, though it still can get pretty hot, which isn't good for its lifespan.",0
It works like a beast and transferring over my stuff onto this new one was super easy.,0
works as promised,0
This company has quality problems. My less than two year old computer out of warranty died today. A previous one had the plastic hinge break tearing the screen. Now my newer Asus computer is less than two years old and the screen is not working this morning. Has hash over half the screen. No damage just failed. My advice get a different brand. Asus is junk.,0
It was a gift for my sister and she really loves it. Not the best laptop but good quality for the price.,0
"I did a LOT of research looking for a laptop over the last couple months and I always ended up back to this one. I was excited to receive and start up the system and at first glance everything was great. The screen and keyboard are awesome, it’s fast and easy to use. The fingerprint reader worked for me every time. The problem with my system is it started making a very high pitched squeaking noise under the keyboard randomly. I am 24, my mom and dad couldn’t hear it. So I did a little research and I guess it is called coil whine and it’s common with this laptop! I wish I knew about it before purchasing. The noise was so bad it gave me a headache so I tried different internet solutions but none worked. I had to return it and am now trying to look for another system :/. If that wasn’t a common problem then this laptop would have been perfect.",0
"Was very excited to get this laptop, despite some of the negative reviews. I love the form factor and the power they packed into it. Unfortunately, when I received the laptop, the screen inside of the laptop was crooked. That is, the left side of the screen was ~1mm higher than the right, so it slanted downward noticeably from left-to-right. That's ultimately why I returned it to Amazon (I tried to call Razer's support, but they had apparently closed a few days early before the Holidays...).I also ran AS SSD on the laptop when I got it, and confirmed what others had noticed: the SSD was performing @ ~1GB/s sequential, which is < 1/2 of the performance you would expect with a Samsung PM981 (which is what's installed). The i7-8750H only has 16 PCI-E lanes off the chip, and since the GTX MAX-Q 1070 requires 16 lanes, the SSD must be running off of the chipset. The i7-8750H has 8GT/s to the chipset, which is 1GB/s without the overhead, so the 1GB speed cap makes sense and is all you can really expect out of this hardware. AFAIK, all of Intel's 8th gen mobile CPU's are limited to 16 lanes off the chip, so this is really par-for-the-course and isn't the fault of Razer.(That being said then, the PM981 might actually be overkill for a laptop like this, unless you really need the random IOPS or slightly faster access times.)",0
Useless POS Windows 10 S mode (nanny mode) & you can't disable it. Will only run apps from Microsoft -- couldn't run Canon scanner/printer or allow me to install software for it -- only reason I bought it.,0
"I really love this laptop, I found it fast, light and its design is just so elegant!",0
Suffering from random FPS drops and this kills your gaming experience.,0
"Does not hsve touch screen, works fine with mouse",0
I cancelled the purchase,0
Works as expected,0
"Liked the size and weight for travel, but that's it. Things started falling apart after 6 months or so. Keys stopped working, or required heavy punching, for example. Some settings can't be changed or turned off once you change them the first time. The frequency of upgrades/fixes is really annoying (but that tech's mentality -- no reason to wait until things are stable to sell something!), and the screen size isn't something I would ever want for daily use. It makes a good toy.",0
I really enjoy how beautiful it looks. Slim and powerful.,0
This is a fantastic computer for school. It is really lightweight and fast. I really enjoy how big and bright the screen is and the full HD display. Its plenty fast to use it for the internet and its a guy price!,0
Such a perfect little computer. Very happy.,0
"This Chromebook is excellent. The setup was easy, log into your gmail account and everything is there. I already use Google docs and Google drive, so all of my files were immediately available. My music is on Amazon, which is cloud based, so it too was accessible. If you use cloud based software, you'll love this, no more Windows! The item was in perfect condition, the price was outstanding, and it arrived quickly. I couldn't ask for more.",0
Not good quality. Flimsy screen dead pixels.,0
"Great laptop. Great lightweight computer for commuting. Works as advertised. Excellent battery life ( I can get 10 hours with battery saver on sometimes). My only complaint is that the trackpad is kind of crappy. You get used to it after awhile, but it can be a little wonky. Everything else works great.",0
The black and gold really looks fantastic and the LED options really shine.,0
"This computer was milled to be basic. The mouse pad feels ""meh"". (It clicks like pressing on the top of a tin can would sound). The keys are budget & gives ill advised responses with the slightest touch.... :(I got it (as an option) for 2,3 programs that only use MSoft programs & 2 test using controllers. Oh yeah, The screen looks is a bit grainy? matted? ish?",0
Had a mini adjustment phase coming from a pc to Mac but its been great thus far and the battery life is incredible,0
"The touch mouse pad is decent, although it tends to do something other than what I intended it to do.",0
"I bought this chromebook about 2 weeks ago, and so far, it is working really good. It doesn't come with a mouse, so if you want one, get it while you are getting this chromebook. My son bought this same kind of chromebook from a nearby store. Because of his chromebook, I wanted one too. I'm glad I got it.",0
FN+F9 Combinations does not light up the keyboard,0
I received this laptop April 22 2021… its now May 17 2021 and the mouse has quit working. I don't want to even bother with the return because it'll take over a month just to get a replacement… if u buy this u better buy a wireless or usb mouse!!,0
a bunch of dead pixels in the center of the screen about four inches from the left,0
"Only got this yesterday but already super impressed and thrilled with this Ideapad! Color is great, easy to set it up and use. Very happy with my purchase!",0
"So far no problems, I thought it came with Microsoft office but it was just a trial. However I am happy with the laptop",0
I love this Hp laptop. It's similar to a chome book but this laptop the Windows installed not chome OS. Great for school but not for large program application.,0
This gaming laptop is perfect for new generation and demanding games. The price/quality is very good. It can run simulators like DCS and FS2020 without difficulties. I would only upgrade the M.2 SSD for more capacity (250GB isn't enough),0
Owned for 2 weeks and sd card reader stopped working. Unit is worthless to me without the ability to expand storage.,0
Stopped charging after a month and a half. Very disappointing.,0
"gap near web cam left size is bigger than the right side, mouse in certain parts looks lower",0
Connecting to the network and internet was easy / breezy,0
"Some of the lightest load, 6-7% CPU load, a second later, the fans start going bunkers.",0
"The lid and its hinges are suitably stiff, don't flop, wiggle or creak when I shake the machine with the screen at a reasonable angle",0
Good Brand Samsung laptop for $169.00,0

"El producto está muy bien, pero tiene un problema con la pantalla, tiene manchas a los costados como nubes que son más visibles en lo oscuro.",0
fast and efficient what you needed,0
"It's a great device! It's fast due to its ssd and video card. But you have to remember it's a Windows machine so it can only get to where the OS permits.I use it to edit photos in a very non-efficient program, Skylum Luminar, it loads faster than in my previous razer blade 15 2018 base model, but it's still Windows!It's very easy to carry around, it's light and fancy. Battery last long, really long for a device this size.MSI was nice to include a USB-C hub for additional connectivity and a leather-like carrying pouch -nice touch.Happy with the device? So far, YES!!!!!! I just wish Windows took advantage of the hardware of this beast.",0
"Great gaming notebook, this is my most satisfying electronic product of the year",0
"Terrible terrible screen . Worse than expected, color coverage across the entire screen is not even even when looking straight at this thing! God forbid you move your head more than 1/8"" when viewing a picture or video and you just got another set of colors.",0
It is really clean there is some black light bleed but i never notice it because i don’t really care havent experienced any screen tear but if you want 30 more frames i suggest buying another stick of ram wither two 8 ram or another 16 ram,0
"She does not game with it but its got a lot of power, and takes M.2 so its very fast",0
excelent,0
I got this for my nephew for Christmas ! I was very surprised with the quality especially since I didn’t spend that much money on it ! I love it! I hope he loves it as well,0
"I primarily needed a new laptop that could handle a little bit of MMORPG gaming and photo editing. Really, photo editing was the main thing I needed. Definitely take your time to research what laptop to get first before proceeding to buy what may feel will be the right piece of technology for you. I knew ASUS and Lenovo have some good equipment so I looked into ASUS primarily. 8GB of RAM is recommended really to get the job done with most things. This laptop that I just ordered has 256GB of SSD (Solid State Drive), which definitely helps out when it comes to photo editing for me or even just doing general work (email, research, social media links, etc). Honestly, I'm really content with how my laptop came to be.The box was well-sealed. Laptop looked brand-spanking new to my eyes. It felt light-ish. However, when first started it up, it did run the drive pretty harsh but I think that was just the necessary initial start-up to get the laptop running. Other than that, it's been a whole day since I've had the laptop and it really fits all the things I needed to do with it.The keyboard has backlight, which I didn't read that but found out through working with the laptop. The battery life really says what it lasts for: 8 hours or so. I'm not iffy when it comes to a keyboard, but this one felt right to me. Different keyboards will come with adjustment absolutely. One thing different from my last laptop was a number keypad to my right; that will take some time to adjust without having access to that. The sound projection isn't terrible, but it is way better than my previous laptop. I bought the laptop without any Microsoft software, however, it provides a trial for the software but I'll be switching around laptops for certain things for myself. I definitely see great duration for this beauty and will keep this updated if remembered.",0
This laptop will hopefully bring me into the 21st century with its ever-evolving computer technology. For years I've lagged behind the rest of the world with unreliable internet connections and other problems. As my 2nd device Chromebook seems to have fixed that. My old notebook now snaps to attention when I tell it to connect. Maybe it's just afraid of losing its job! In any case I'm happy with the purchase.,0
Great 2 in 1 for the price,0
"Hi folks,Here are a few things to keep in mind (regarding the 2020 version – Intel 10th Generation/4000 AMD Series):A) Be aware that the 120Hz version of the Legion 5 has 250 nits of brightness and can’t be used outside in sunny weather as the screen will look washed out - additionally, color saturation and reproduction is dismal, thus not ideal for video and content creation. The RGB version, at least as sold on Amazon, sports that 120Hz version which I would purchase except for the fact that the brightness is poor. The 144Hz version that is sold directly from Amazon has 300+ nits of brightness and is a better product, even for sunny outdoors. There is also a 60Hz version which also has 300+ nits of brightness.B) The Legion 5 has space for an SSD upgrade, NVME upgrade as well as two system RAM slots. The Legion 5’s chipset can support up to 64 gigabytes of total system memory (i.e. 32GB x 32GB).C) If you purchase from Amazon as the seller, you can return the notebook for free WITHOUT any restocking fees. If you purchase the notebook from a 3rd party seller, then you will have serious restocking fees in excess of up to 50%. So, check their respective return policies carefully. If for whatever reason you have a quality assurance issue(s) and have to return the Legion 5, you can request a refund OR replacement IF you had purchased from Amazon as the primary seller. If you purchase from any other reseller other than Amazon, then you can only request a refund, not replacement.D) The 1660i ti graphics card generally tends to do about 14% faster than the 2060 Max Q version. “Max Q” refers to Nvidia’s reduction of wattage to reduce heat coming off the graphics card, but to maximize as much of the graphical power of the graphics card. If you want more graphics power out of a Legion 5, you can choose the regular 2060 version (non Max-Q version) or opt for the 10th Generation Intel processor Legion 5’s which have the 2070 or 2080 graphics card – the AMD versions only come with the 1660 ti or 2060 as the high end cards. The Nvidia 1650, found on some Legion models and is a bit cheaper, are about 47% slower than the 1660 ti in games. Hopefully, with the 2021 version of Legion 5’s, higher end graphic card options will come with the AMD processors. In sum, the Legion 5 (be it with the AMD or Intel Processor) is great, not only for gaming, but for content creation/encoding as well as multi-tasking productivity duties. As a healthcare administrator/physician, the Legion 5 is truly a jack of all trades and does it exceptionally well.E) The Type C USB port, the 2020 version, is for display video out or data. It doesn’t charge the laptop. However, the 2021 version of the Type C USB port, with the incoming 5000 AMD series of processors and 11th Generation of Intel processors, WILL support power charging. Thus, you won’t be relegated to having to utilize the included power charger 230 Watt brick, but have cheaper and light weighted type C chargers at short notice. Big improvement.F) Regarding battery life: I was able to concurrently run both a Hulu and YouTube video with brightness set to 200 nits with the keyboard light set to dim and I recorded 4 hours flat of battery run time. Note that you can upgrade to the 80 Watt battery and purchase it from Amazon from $100-120.00 and get an additional 2 hours to give you about 6-7 hours of total battery run time. Pretty impressive for a gaming notebook. Running a video game exclusively on battery power will only give you about 2 hours max run time.G) The lithium battery has fast charging and I was able to charge from 5% to 95% full capacity in about one hours time (with the computer turned off). Make note that fast charging can be enabled/disabled in the BIOS. I would suggest using the fast charging when you are pinched for time (i.e. between long meetings and other short term moments where you need as much battery charge as possible). Research has shown, that over time, that lithium cells get damaged and overall lifespan of the battery declines if you utilize fast charging excessively. So, use fast charging sparingly.H) Finally, Legion Ultimate Support – this is the default warranty that you get for 12 months for free which includes a special phone number to call for technical or customer service 24/7, 365 days of the year. I tested this out at 4am while I was work at the hospital, and sure enough, someone actually answered the Legion 5 special customer service line. This warranty also includes onsite (i.e. your place of residence) repair support within one to two days of an issue that cannot be resolved via telephone; or you will be directed to a local repair shop. Pretty impressive considering other laptop vendors charge extra (like $100-$300/year) for this service but you get it for free as standard. Well done Lenovo.Remember, while Lenovo is new to the gaming notebook party, they’ve made impressive generational strides since their first gaming notebook in early 2017. I would heartily recommend the Legion 5 to my colleagues, patients and family members.",0
Just what I wanted,0
10 year old Granddaughter likes it,0
This is a great item. And the price is fantastic. I highly recommend this Chromebook.,0
"the audio on this PC has a mind of its own. it connects to my air pods when they are closed in a far away room. during zoom meetings, it will randomly stop working and i cant hear anything. the camera is not to clear either.the two finger scrolling is not too great either. again, on some days it will be ok and then on some it will start scrolling when im not even touching it!other than that it is ok, for normal computer functions, but not worth 600$",0
"First time buying a gaming laptop. 512gb isn't too much but luckily, there's a second sdd slot so just slap a 1tb sdd in and your set. 16gb of ram has been sufficient for my gaming. I usually just play warzone alot and it runs smoothly.",0
"What’s not to like? It’s a great Apple product! Bought to replace a 2013 MacBook Pro that worked flawlessly right up until it was destroyed in an accident. Setting it up and getting on with my life was pretty seamless, as it has been on every Apple product I’ve ever upgraded. I’m enjoying the increased speed and more up to date features as a bonus — especially longer battery life!",0
My laptop stopped working and turning on after a week of use. I really just want to return it and get my money back. This is waste. I just want my money back.,0
"I needed a good computer for the money, and this was it. The sound could be better than what you get.",0
"I use it for online schooling andit's perfect. I dont usually care for laptops, but this one is easy to use and on the smaller side so easier to use.",0
"Great power and performance for the price. It's get's a little warm, but the cooling pad I have underneath keeps things in check. It's plays Overwatch and my other favorites on full settings without any flaws. Love this thing!",0
Es una computadora muy rápida a un precio inmejorable. Antes de comprarla compare y esta fue la mejor opción en todos los aspectos :),0
"I carefully and thoroughly researched gaming computers for three weeks. I screened every major brand looking for a unit having a very large screen, high ram, very high storage, an incredibly strong video card, and a multi-core very fast processor.I I wanted every component to have the most recognized name brand. Last it had to be under $1500 in cost. Sager had the only unit that met every single requirement. I have just received and unboxed it and was especially impressed with the packaging. I will post a performance review after I see what it cab do.Performance review:Light speed fast. Never crashes; runs cool. Rated to play some 9000 games. Love it!",0
"UPDATE: For anyone who doubted that the mobo in the 2022 version of this laptop supported Gen 4 SSD's, you can put those doubts to rest. I received, installed and tested the 1tb Gen 4 Micron 3400 series SSD that I ordered. The drive is rated to achieve 6600 read and 5000 write. Chrystal Disk tests mine out at 6545.55 read and 4934.03 write. The only way that I could realize the top speeds of my new Micron Gen 4 SSD is if the Mobo supported Gen 4 SSD's. So there you have it. Just be aware that a Gen 4 SSD in a Gen 4 mobo will run hotter than a Gen 3 SSD in a Gen 4 mobo. To make matters a bit worse, there isnt a lot of room inside this laptop for air flow. This may be why the manufacturer of the 2022 version used a Gen 3 SSD instead of a Gen 4 SSD. This is by no means an insurmountable problem. Just make sure that you shop for a decent M.2 SSD heat sink at the same time that you're shopping for that new ultra fast Gen 4 SSD. Ive used a 1mm thick graphene coated copper plate, on top of a 1mm thick silicone pad on top of a 0.07mm thick layer of graphene tape. This may be overkill but I dont want to waste even a single, brief worry on how hot my drive might be getting lol! I see the price of the laptop went up a bit. Its still a bargain!The GTX 980ti GPU in my old, self built desk top gaming system died last January and Ive been ""slumming it"" with a Radeon 7770 ever since because, after COVID hit, the price of seriously game worthy graphics cards shot up beyond what I was willing to pay. This laptop didnt cost much more than a really good graphics card so I finally decided to retire the ole' desktop and buy this laptop. So far(after two days, mind you lol), Im very happy that I did.First, let me straighten out one big issue. I AM REVIEWING THE 2022 Model! NOT THE 2021 Model! I asked a couple of questions about my 2022 system in the customer question area and mostly got replies from well-meaning folk who own the 2021 model. Unfortunately for those who bought the 2021 model a year ago or less for the same or greater money, the 2022 model is a significant upgrade and has some features which do not apply to the 2021 model. Many answers supplied by 2021 model owners cannot be applied to 2022 model owners. Its surely a fact that Ill be in the same boat as the 2021 model owners come 2023. Thats just how tech growth works.Anyway, the 2022 model uses ddr5 ram(2021 model uses DDR4) and has no problem mixing 1xr8 ram with 2xr8 ram. If you dont know the difference between the two, here is what little I know: They are essentially the same except that 1xr8 ram is one sided. 2xr8 ram is two sided. From what I understand, smaller sticks of ram will usually be 1xr8 while larger sticks(32gb and up) will usually be 2xr8. Some motherboards will not let you mix single sided ram with double sided ram. The mobo on the 2022 system will and from what Ive read in the reviews, so will the mobo on the 2021 system, so thats great. I added 32gb 2xr8 Samsung ram to my 2022 model for a system recognized total of 40gb. Ill be removing the remaining stock 8gb ram and replacing it with another 32gb stick in the beginning of Oct, when my new budget starts. That will bring my system to 64gb ram which I ""think"" is the max. IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2022 system comes with two slots for ram and has an 8gb stick in each slot. Both 8gb sticks of ram can be removed and replaced. NO RAM IS SOLDERED TO THE MOBO IN THE 2022 MODEL.Ok, next and also very important; The m.2 PCIe SSD interface on the 2022 motherboard is GEN 4(also awesome!). This was verified by the seller who has been excellent about very quickly responding to questions in the question-and-answer area for this product. The 2021 model mobo uses a GEN 3 PCIe interface. The difference between GEN 3 and GEN 4 in how fast info can be processed can be huge, depending upon the SSD you use. Put a Gen 3 SSD in a Gen 4 capable system and you'll be limited to the processing speeds of the Gen 3 SSD. Put a Gen 4 SSD in a Gen 3 system and the Gen 3 system will limit your Gen 4 SSD to Gen 3 speeds. But put a Gen 4 SSD in a GEN 4 capable system and you're gonna get the fastest speeds possible for that drive in that system.Unfortunately, the 512gb SSD included in the 2022 system is a Gen 3 Hynix. So, despite the system having a GEN 4 PCIe interface, the included SSD drive limits info transfer/access to GEN 3 speeds. The speeds of the installed Gen 3 SSD are nothing to sneeze at though. The read/write on mine were; read-3555.98 write-2707.89 and 2557.70 and 2581.43. Considering that a large number of Gen 3 SSD's proudly claim numbers significantly lower than those, the installed Hynix drive is pretty decent. But also consider that a high end GEN 4 drive like a Samsung 980 pro claim numbers TWICE those!There are two slots on the 2022 systems mobo for an m.2 SSD. One has the previously mentioned Hynix SSD already installed and that contains the laptops OS. Ive installed a gen 3 VisionTek SSD into the second m.2 slot on my laptops mobo. Its just a drive I had kicking around. I got a GEN 4, 1tb Micron 3400 series drive for a very good price and will be transferring my OS to that when it arrives in a few days. The Gen 4 micron SSD claims speeds of over 6000 read and over 5000 write as long as its in a mobo that is GEN 4 capable. Ill remove the preinstalled Hynix SSD and replace it with the much faster Micron SSD as my OS disk. Ill probably stash the Hynix SSD safely away somewhere, OS intact, as a backup in case the Micron drive ever dies for some reason. Finally, Ill probably leave the VisionTek drive in the 2nd M.2 slot and use it strictly for game storage.Im not sure what else that I can add that someone might find useful. Everything Ive written so far is stuff I had wished someone else would've listed somewhere in the reviews or question and answer area. I had to do a serious bit of research to figure it out on my own. Ive only had this system for a couple of days now but Ive been using it ever since it arrived(its so nice to have a fully functional system again, that is capable of running everything I like to run with ease!). I cant comment on battery life or heat issues since I keep my laptop plugged in 99% of the time and keep it on a laptop cooling pad whenever in use. There are options to limit the charge of the battery to 60%(or 80% if you so choose) which is supposed to drastically increase the overall life of the battery but again, such options are only applicable if you use the laptop plugged in most of the time-which I do. There are simply a whole lot of features for configuring the system to your needs and likings. To go through them all would be to make this review into more of a book that I already have so Im gonna stop here.This is a great system for the money. If I were you, Id grab it while you can.",0

"Upgraded from my 2014 MacbookAir b/c it was slowing down. This 2020 MacbookAir started out great, but within 3 weeks it's slowing down too! Display is more or less fine. Front camera quality seems to have deteriorated somewhat. But trying to open applications, download/upload files, etc . . . is getting slow now and it's annoying.",0
"Over all oowww awesome power laptop for this price. this is my stock trading laptop 16gb/512gb ssd very fast!!! lightweight and thin, for me the down side is flat keyboard not use to it yet and wish the battery last longer.",0
"Today our Samsung XE520QAB-K02US Chromebook Plus V2 stopped working. I purchased it August 2019, it lasted 14 months. While it was working my daughter liked it... Problem appears to be with the charging unit because when I plug it in for a few seconds I see a blue light but then quickly goes to red. I was able to force it into recovery mode briefly. Then back to blank. Very disappointed it did not last longer!",0
This is an amazing product for the price. I am going to buy another one for my son.,0
"It worked okay for the first week or so, although the keys backlight didn't work.Then it went completely dead. It was no more. Stone dead. Joined the bleedin' choir invisible. It was an ex-parrot.",0
"So far, this computer has been able to tackle everything I have needed it to. As an architecture student, I need a lot of processing power and a decent screen - this computer fills both needs well. I switched over from a 2011 Macbook Pro and although Windows is not my favorite the processing power is what I needed to use programs like Revit, AutoCAD, and Sketchup.A couple things which are just negligent on my part but good to reiterate - this laptop does NOT have a DVD drive, also the screen is not as nice as the Macbook pro.Also - the battery sucks a lot (after a few months of use, I'm regretting this purchase)",0
seems to be made of a cheaper material,0
"I've used Chromebooks for years as my everyday laptop. This 2nd generation Plus with an M3 satisfies all my normal needs and wants. I use multiple windows/tabs and this machine handles that without a problem. I pushed it to about 30 open tabs running multiple videos and audio before it bogged down.The display is beautiful at all angles. The keyboard travel feels l great and only lacks backlight. The track pad and touchscreen are flawless. Though I considered the pen a gimmick I have found it useful for some situations.Google has solved some of the problems Android apps had on Intel. The UI for switching between Chrome & Android apps has vastly improved, making a Chromebook more useful and productive. The pen is great for the Android photo editing apps and the Chrome app Polar.The 2in1 form works well. The hinges seem built to last, but I would say the Samsung is a bit too heavy to use as a tablet for more than 10 minutes. Google has improved the UI to the point where Chrome works well as a tablet. But, if you want a tablet first there are better options like the HP or Google Slate.This is an excellent laptop with only a few compromises. The plastic bottom creeks a bit, the only indication this is not a solid all metal body. I paid around $500 and that is an amazing value for a laptop that performs this well.",0
"Absolutely loved the product for the month it worked... After that it would not show any signs of life, whenever I tried to start the device it would not turn on or even show charge. I would charge it for a few hours and the led would display charge but the laptop refused to start and once disconnected from the outlet would once again display zero signs of life.I have sent multiple messages to the seller through Amazon with zero response. Do not buy this product and if you do go directly so if it buggers up you can get a replacement!",0
"I financed this laptop last month only to pay it off eighteen days later from moneys saved to purchase car tires. For several days it worked like a charm until it fell from a table onto a concrete floor with my Apple iPad Pro tablet. There were no scratches nor dents on my tablet; however, my NEW Lenovo Flex 5 took a serious beating! When facing the monitor, the left corner below the keyboard is permanently bent, and the frame has buckled on that side. The speaker still works, but it is now uncomfortable to rest my arm in that area. Yet, the product now belongs to me so I decided to continue using it to learn coding and to prepare teaching engineering to high school students this fall.Based on the published description of the laptop on Lenovo's official website, I figured it can handle The Sims 4 software and the three of its expansion kits on top of my education apps- boy was I wrong! Since loading the Sims 4, the Flex 5 takes longer to restart and to process commands. The quality went from a $650 Lenovo laptop to a $199 Dell Chromebook. A total disappointment indeed! The school district invested in a $1,500 Lenonovo laptop for my engineering courses; however, the weight is unbearable to hold in one arm after two minutes. The Flex 5 was going to work wonders due to having the capability to rotate the monitor behind the keyboard to convert it into a tablet. I just have to remind myself to remove the clear keyboard cover to prevent it from falling to the ground. The finger ID makes it convenient to log on; however, the processing speed is not what I expected. I should have waited and saved moneys to purchase another Apple Macbook Air, because my 2013 laptop fell onto concrete in the past and is still going strong without any physical damages.This purchase altered my perception of Lenovo by far, and I will consider purchasing a Samsung laptop the next go round. :-(",0
Love it light weight it's just great . I use it for research battery life excellent,0
"I bought this laptop back when it only had 3 reviews. I was kinda miffed by the specs that not that many have bought it prior, so I took a chance.Pros:- It plays whatever I throw at it like a dream, the RTX chip is godsend, coming from a lower end PC. I'm not used to seeing games on Max with more than 20 frames lol- The audio is pretty crisp, I use to always use headphones on my old set up, but I don't feel like I need to with this laptop.- The general look and feel is definitely premium, this thing is built like a tank. Compared to my other gadgets like my iPad, I'm not so paranoid about any drops or bumps. (Ofc I'm still over protective of this thing)- Beautiful display, I tend to use my laptop over my smart tv when it comes to movies anymore. The LED keyboard also sets the mood which is a huge plus.Cons:- My main beef is the storage, I wish it had 1T SSD but for the price with the RTX I couldn't pass this up. I'll definitely need an external HD or have a friend install an SSD down the road.- While it's dead built like a tank, it also heavy like one too. This isn't fun to carry around, especially being a weak nerd.- Battery life is practically non existent, not even 30 mins into gaming, I'm having to fish for my charger. I kinda expected that but again it makes the portability kinda sucky.In conclusion, I feel like the pros definitely out weigh the cons. I've always wanted a Lenovo, and I'm definitely not regretting getting one! I really love this laptop!",0
BOUGHT for my DadHe loves it,0
the keyboard which is still not up to par with Dell; HP; Apple etc.,0
This product was a gift for a recent high school graduate who needs it for college in the fall (and is using it right now as well). Recipient liked all the features of this lap top.,0
"Love my wonderfully portable and zippy new machine. I've had a few months now, and so far so good!",0
"Great gaming computer, low quality webcam everything else is great!",0
"For a notebook sized laptop, this thing is quite the beast when it comes to graphical and processing power. Now I know it doesn't stack up against a prim and proper desktop computer that is built with top of the line components, but with the current economy and apparent chip shortages products like these will be in higher demand. Overall, it will run all of the games I want to play at a good resolution (1080p) at high or ultra settings at a stable 60 FPS.While this laptop for the price is an absolute steal, I needed to spend an extra $100 for it to truly shine. The SSD on this laptop is only 237GB which is dreadfully small if you're into gaming so be prepared to invest in a external hard drive in the size of your choosing. My monitor which is around 6 years old only uses a HDMI cord so I needed to buy an HDMI to VGA so I can connect this laptop to my monitor. Finally, this laptop also has two USB ports; one type 2.0 port and one type C. In order to connect my keyboard, mouse, and XBOX 360 adapter I needed to buy a USB hub that goes into the type C slot. In my opinion, while it might be a pain to drop another $100; in the end it was absolutely worth it.Now I have a list of games that I have played or tested that I believe may help any potential buyer decided on taking a chance with this laptop. Do note that I aimed for a stable 60 FPS and all are at 1080p.Yakuza Like a Dragon- Maintained 60 FPS on high settings.Witcher 3 GOTY - 60 FPS with dips into the low 50's on ultra settingsBattlefield 4- 60 FPS on ultra.Watchdogs 2- 60 FPS with dips into the low 50's on high/ultra settings.Doom Eternal- 60 FPS on ultra.Deus Ex Mankind Divided - 60 FPS on high/ultra.Fallout 4 (no graphics mods) - 60 FPS on ultra.Star Wars Battlefront 2 - 60 FPS on highFarcry 5- 60 FPS on ultra.Mass Effect Andromeda- 60 FPS with dips into the low 50's on high/ultra.Overwatch- 60 FPS on ultra.",0
"El producto llego en excelentes condiciones y en el tiempo indicado. Es mi primera laptop gamer y puedo decir que no me arrepiento de nada, corre prácticamente todos los juegos. Actualmente llevo mas del mes con el producto, pasando los 3 meses vuelvo a hacer reseña del producto.Lo único que compre aparte fue una memoria ram y una ssd extra, por que soy de los que le encantan tener demasiados juegos, pero con lo que la computadora tiene de fabrica es suficiente para poder disfrutar.",0
"I purchased this New XPS 13 9380 directly from Dell. My purchase experience with Dell was dreadful. More about that later. For now, just know that if you do decide to buy any Dell PC, I strongly recommend that you do NOT purchase direct from Dell. Instead, purchase from Amazon or some other retailerOut of the box, the first very aggravating thing I noticed on initial boot up was that the back-lighting on the white keyboard makes it impossible to tell which key is which. I guess if I were sitting in a cave or a closet, the back-lighting might help, but in anything like ordinary lighting conditions, the back-lighting makes it very much harder to tell which key is which. This back-lighting """"""""feature"""""""" (quadruple scare quotes intended) seems to be an example of someone at Dell falling so totally in love with a concept that they forget to consider whether the concept actually does what it is supposed to do. So I spent 30 minutes Googling how to ""fix"" this lovely feature by turning off the backlighting. (You have to change the BIOS settings!) And then I spent another good while worrying about whether attempting the fix (by going into BIOS) might ruin my brand new multi thousand dollar machine. But then I figured, the heck with it: if I'm going to do break this baby, now is the time, because my best shot at getting my money back is now when it is fresh out of the box. So I went into BIOS and turned off the ding-dang back-lighting so now I can actually see the keys. Really, guys, if you are going to make a """"""""feature"""""""" that works best when it's turned off, maybe you oughta at least make it so the poor customer doesn't have to modify BIOS to shut the dang thing off.Other first impressions: The initial boot up sequence was clunky and didn't work quite right. When I was asked if I wanted to set up MS Office, and clicked ""yes,"" I didn't realize it would be setting up the free-for-30-day subscription version of Office (Office 365) instead of the permanent-license version that I paid for when I bought this machine from Dell. Then later, I was navigated involuntarily to a download of the what I now realize was the permanent license version of Office that I had already paid for. So I DL'd that and installed it. Well, it turns out that having both the subscription version and the permanent version of Office on this machine was not a good thing, because they didn't seem to play nice together. Argggg! Although the technology itself is getting better, the implementation and coordination of the technology is getting worse.Also, I have to mention that my purchase experience with Dell was an utter complete and total fiasco. It was like a circus, when the elephants and lions escape into the crowd and start eating people and trampling people. Okay, it wasn't quite that bad, but it was a major, multi-part fiasco. Just one small example of the fiasco: I had to cancel my initial order with Dell and re-order because the person who took my initial order left the ""A"" off of my house number. The Dell rep told me cancelling and re-ordering was the only way to fix the error, but assured me it would take ""only a few minutes."" One and one-half hours later, we were still on the phone trying to get things corrected with Dell Financial Services (which also used the wrong address) to make sure that I didn't get charged for two orders instead of just one. I would never have financed the machine (I have plenty of money, thank you) except the guy who took my first order (the guy who messed up the address in the first place) said it would help him out if I did so. Apparently, the Dell sales people get some kind of benefit if they can get customers to sign up for financing. The financing was free for one year, so I figured, ""what the heck, I'll take the financing if it helps out one of my fellow human beings."" Big mistake! Because it took hours to fix the address error with Dell Financial Services.I forgot to mention that Dell has a a price match guarantee, according to which, if you are buying directly from Dell, Dell will match the price offered by any other qualifying retailer, including Amazon. The thing is, when I found a cheaper price on Amazon, Dell did not want to match the price. First the Dell sales rep said they couldn't find the matching item on Amazon. So I emailed Dell the link to the match item. Then they said the link did not connect to the matching item, so I emailed them a screen shot that showed that it did match. Then Dell said the link was for an item that did not qualify. I asked why, and the Dell rep said a supervisor would have to explain it to me. So I waited on hold for a Dell supervisor. The supervisor went through three or four bogus reasons why the item on Amazon supposedly was not a qualifying offer, but I shot those down, one by one, using Dell's own term and conditions for the price match. Finally, the supervisor agreed that the offer I showed him did qualify for the price match, and he accepted the order. But then, he entered my address wrong on the order. So when I got the confirmation email, they said I had to cancel and re-order, at which point I said, I am not doing that again. If I try to re-order, your sales people will make me jump again to receive your price-match guarantee. I told them if they sent the product to the wrong address and it was lost, that would be on Dell, because I had a recording of our phone conversation wherein I specifically emphasized the ""A"" that is appended on my house number. So finally, they bumped me up the Dell hierarchy a couple of levels, and the person I connected with agreed to fix the issue, which she said would take only few minutes. But, as previously mentioned, it took hours to fix the simple mistake of an incorrect address.So if you must buy a Dell product (which are overpriced unless you buy them with a steep discount), do not purchase directly from Dell.The whole ordering experience put me in a bad frame of mind, but I was ready to be happy when my machine arrived. But then, the first time I boot up, I noticed that the back-lit keyboard makes it impossible to see the lettering on the keys . . . Sheeesh!",0
Have it for about two months and its amazing,0
"Parents: If you're thinking of buying this Samsung Chromebook for your kids Zoom/virtual schooling......then DON'T! Yes, its only $300. But within the first 10 minutes of use you're going to think this isn't worth $3. Internet is slow, programs are glitchy, Zoom via Chrome browser stutters, slows down, interrupts itself constantly. I tried downloading the Zoom app from the Google Play store thinking that the app may work better. NOPE. I get an error message saying that this device is not eligible to download the Zoom app from Google Play store.FYI: I have super high speed internet (500mb download). I do not have any problems with my internet or Zoom on my Macbooks in my home. But with this Samsung Chromebook, I feel like I'm back in the dial-up days. Total fail. Return to Amazon!",0
Wish i would have purchased the lenovo laptop from the beginning and would not have go threw the trouble of trying to get my refund on the acer. Amazon needs to improve there refund system I've been a member for 10 years have a good day.,0

Gaming is not my first use for this notebook. I wanted good performance and still have some resemblance of battery life. This is nicely sized notebook that travels well and covers both my professional and personal needs.,0
M1 processor performs great. Would rate a 5 if I could run my iPad applications. Limited apps compared to iPhone and iPad. Hopefully this will improve.,0

Keyboard is responsive.,0
"Much lighter than the average laptop so it's more convenient to travel with or just have with you on days when you don't have serious work to do; just throw it in your bag and go. The battery lasts at least 6-8 hours even with heavy usage and charges at a speed similar to a cell phone. The sound quality is not that great, but is as expected for the price point. The Bluetooth feature and headphone options are nice as well as the HDMI and USB ports. I would buy again.",0
Love how it downloaded info from the old chromebook seamlessly.,0

This is a great computer. The only drawback is that I thought it was touch screen and I found out that it was not. I still like it though.,0
"Great machine, runs cool",0
Works amazing took me less than 5 minutes to setup 5 more for updates and im gaming its great if you're like me always moving around traveling . Desktop is powerful but this little msi is Mobile and its packing strength. The handling and delleveing was beautiful Sooner than the estimated time by week !,0
"A great laptop overall, especially if you get it on sale.",0
"I have owned this computer for almost 2 years now and all I can say is that it is very average. I would highly recommend building your own pc, you will have much better performance for the same price as this machine. Performance is ok but it has a hard time running a game with programs running in the background. The one thing good about this laptop is that it is pretty light and very portable.",0
"This thing is an absolute monster of a laptop. High-Ultra AAA gaming? Check! HD VR gaming? Check! Low profile frame while keeping aesthetics? Check! Plethora of ports for almost everything? Check! What's not to love about this laptop?Even with high praise, there are still a few caveats to keep in mind. The USB-C port does not support video out. It is only data. The fan runs pretty loud. This is fine with me tho because it keeps the GPU and CPU at a manageable level, even while I have Solidworks in the background and playing Destiny 2 in High Settings. I would rather have a loud fan over thermal throttling any day. The battery is not gonna last long, but hey its a gaming laptop what did you expect? The Screen is LCD which is great for some people but if you are looking for any OLED, you might need to spend a few extra hundred. Personally I don't mind the LCD screen since I have the laptop hooked up to my 4k tv.Bottom Line: This laptop is great and will absolutely shred anything you throw at it. I have not seen it stutter or hiccup once while I was running a bunch of different things. Absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a desktop replacement.",0
Very fast. Should come with a converter for USB.,0
Terrible laptop. Locks up all the time when I am using WORD. I will never purchase another ASUS. I will stick to Dell.,0

I really like the Chromecast setup myself, beautify of a screen, great battery life, and fairly fast * 4gb RAM *. Only draw back.... the keyboard is very hard to see at night time, no backlighting or assistance there. You know what tho, that's all right, for the price!I do college stuff on this.I do many other professional things on it too!Also, I like youtube videos and movies which come in great. Many ports on the sides.",0

"I especially like the cooling potential during high stress use. I had never seen so much vent area on a laptop. The battery life is a joke when using extreme performance mode. However, the battery holds up fine for browsing the internet for hours in battery saver mode. I like the per key rgb lighting. I can adjust both color and intensity of the keyboard. The portability is great and the number pad is a must for work.",0

"Barely works for having a few word documents open at once, constantly has issues where it shuts off and won’t turn back on, sometimes for days at a time. It seems like this laptop only works when it wants to, and even then you’d be lucky to get good use out of it. Even Minecraft lags on this thing.",0
This is just such a great laptop. It is perfection in every way. I did order mine with 512 of storage and 16 GB's of memory. Air is a great name for it because using it is like moving through air...effortless...a real joy.,0

"The screen for this product broke within 9 months. I contacted ASUS customer service since it was still under warranty, I was told it would take 10 days, at most to fix. That was 75+ days ago. After speaking with multiple customer service agents, they cannot locate where my laptop and are not offering a replacement. The customer service has been HORRIBLE. Don’t expect the laptop to work for a year or for ASUS to fix the problem. I wish I would have bought a laptop from a different company. Save your money and the frustration. Stay away from ASUS",0

"This laptop is perfect for gaming on a budget. You're matching the performance of nearly every laptop in its range. Are there better options for performance? Yes, but they're also 1500$ and up.",0
This laptop is great for high school students and for students in college who don’t need a top end Mac. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made!,0
"This computer's compatibility with other devices is truly remarkable, it's like a universal translator for technology. However, the weight is a real deal-breaker, it's like carrying around a brick. I can't wait for the day when they'll incorporate advanced, lightweight materials, making the computer as light as a feather.",1
"The track pad is placed just so that every time my hand goes up to type or brushes and the text cursor jumps. Not to mention how google docs needs time to load.It needs to be wider with more ram. Perhaps years ago this would have been a good product, but it’s just underpowered for virtually anything now.",0
"I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I like this laptop. I've been using it for a month, and really enjoy its features.PROS1) My first touch screen laptop. I am surprised how much I use the screen. It is faster than a mouse, although I still use both. It's great.2) Fingerprint reader - I love how quick I can unlock my computer using the fingerprint reader. Also, it works with my password manager, Dashlane. Saves time.3) Tent and tablet mode - I wasn't sure that I'd ever use these modes, but it turns out to be handy. In tablet mode, I found it very convenient during Amazon's Prime Day sales. It has a larger screen than most tablets, and perfect for the Prime Day sales. I use tent mode to watch movies a little closer. The speakers are positioned in such a way that I can hear things clearly whichever way it is set up.4) Pen - Well, I'm not yet fully sold on the usefulness of the pen. Maybe if I liked taking notes by hand or drawing more. Still, it's a nice feature to have.5) Solid State Drive - now whirling parts on the inside, and it is cooler to run.6) Fast, at least so far after one month of heavy use. I'm avoiding downloading too many programs though.7) Speakers are louder and better quality than any of my previous laptops.CONS1) Two normal USB ports, and one USB C port. Since most of my components use regular USB, I had to buy a special adapter to use the USB C port. Still, three ports isn't enough, and the Lenovo pen holder uses one of the ports for stowing.2) Small Hard Drive - with only about 250 GBs of drive space, I can no longer store the amount of photos, movies, etc. that I did on my last computer. No matter, I have a few external drives with several terabytes, but I wish my laptop had more space.3) No DVD drive - But like my hard drive, I have an external DVD drive that I got for around $20.In short, I really like this laptop and would probably buy a Lenovo again when this one eventually goes kaput. Hopefully not for many years.",0
Perfect for doing basic college courses with enough power to run more memory-intensive programs as well.,0
keyboard feels a little flimsy when typing,0
"The Lenovo Legion 5 15 gaming laptop is the latest in a line of popular gaming laptops, and for good reason. The Legion 5 15 achieves a good balance between size, build quality, and performance. This particular version of the Legion 5 15 is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H, Nvidia 3050 Ti 4GB, 1080p 165hz screen, 16 gb of RAM, and a 512gb NVME SSD.The build quality of the Lenovo Legion is pretty nice, with no noticeable flex in the chassis. The keyboard feels pretty standard for a laptop keyboard, so no major complaints there (unless you're a keyboard snob). This version of the Legion 15 comes with a 4-zone RGB keyboard (for that sweet, sweet FPS improvement). If you're familiar with previous version of the Legion 5, then it's essentially the same laptop, just with a Ryzen 7 5800H, a 3050 TI, and a slightly smaller power adapter.Most of the ports are along the back (3x USB A, USB C, HDMI, ethernet, power) with a few on the left (USB C and headphone) and right (USB A), and you have vents along the back and to the rear parts of both sides. These vents are massive to help keep everything cool. The fans are rather loud under load, but this is going to be an issue with most gaming laptops. It also gets warm -- keyboard is fine, but I'm not sure you'll want this on your lap. While this has the latest version of USB C 3.2, this does not have Thunderbolt (but this is an issue with most AMD laptops).In terms of gaming performance, the 3050 TI with that Ryzen 7 5800H works surprisingly well, though CPU exceeds the capability of the 3050 TI. This gets an overall score in 3D Mark Time Spy of 5860, with a graphics score of 5504 and a CPU score of 9261. On Cinebench, it gets a single core score of 1381 and a multi-core score of 11256, which are great for a laptop CPU. It was able to run Shadow of the Tomb Raider with an average FPS of 80 on the high preset at 1080p. You could absolutely tweak the settings and to get higher FPS if you so desired, and with the 165hz screen, you'll want to take advantage of that. Userbenchmark gives this a CPU score of 91.9%, a drive score of 317%, and a memory score of 67.5%; I had trouble getting it to run with the Nvidia card.Speaking of the screen, it looks very good. There's little backlight bleed, and the color quality and brightness are great for a gaming laptop.The speakers are OK, but you're going to still want headphones.Battery life is not great -- I haven't run the battery down, but I'd say only expect maybe 5 hours doing normal stuff and maybe 1-1.5 hours while gaming. This is pretty common for gaming laptops however.PROS?Good build quality?CPU is a beast?Screen is very nice?GPU can play most modern games?Good configuration of RAM and storage for the price?OK weight for a gaming laptop?Priced rightCONS?Loud fans under load?Poor battery lifeAt around $1050 at the time of this writing, you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal for a gaming laptop with similar specs. You can always pay more for more performance, but if this is your price limit and you want to play some more recent titles on the go, this is it chief.",0
Got it for 11th grader to do homework- works Perfect for that,0
"I bought it to play my favorite game, but cannot",0
It’s perfect,0

Arrived when promised. Purchased as gift. Daughter was happy with it,0
"He tenido la desafortunada experiencia, que me llego este producto con un da?o en el puerto de carga, hay que estar sosteniendo el cable de carga, para que el equipo cargue. El equipo funciona bien, pero esta falla se vuelve un problema ya que el equipo lo traje a Latinoamérica, me resulta mas caro hacer la devolución y que me entreguen uno nuevo, que buscar un técnico que lo arregle localmente y perder la garantía.",0
"love it. thunderbolt 4 works very well. the screen is gorgeous and crystal clear. very fast--no delays.i had a samsung note 9 so i'll note the improvements over that one:1. smoother feeling, better keyboard2. faster although the notebook 9 had no slow downs3. 1080 webcam--is quite good4. the trackpad is really smooth--but it is too big so i keep accidentally hitting it when typing. i wish there were a setting to turn off the upper right and upper left parts of the touch pad. same problem as in the note book 95. the screen is a bit bigger--seems bigger, is minorily/modestly noticeable improved6. LOVE the samsung quick search--i can actually find files now--windows search remains terrible.7. transition has gone well from notebook 9 but gosh, so many passwords and secondary text message confirmations of that--a lot of time doing that. A LOT of time.8. windows 11 is okay but i replaced the taskbar and start menu with one that acts more like win 7/win 10 (startallback)9. better connection with my phone (samsung ultra 22)10. windows media player continues to work--needed so i can sync playlists with my phone BUT noe that ultra 22 samsung music player won't play .wma files (so i spent a long time converting those files--though i could have left them as is and used the vlc player).overall--no regrets. great laptop. SO MUCH computer in such a LIGHT package. it is amazing.",0
The speakers are week and sound quality is just crap.,0
"This system is extremely slow. I uninstalled the MS Office 365 package, since I do not need it on this system. This was to be used simply for a home computer - internet searching, browsing and I was hoping for better system response time to play silly stress relief games, nothing that takes much system power. The system was responding ok after uninstalling the office package, but then a windows update came through and it's back to responding slower than a low end tablet I have. I'm sorry I bought this item - I do not believe that it was rated for the windows 10 OS, if it had windows 7 loaded it may work ok.",0
"El equipo es perfecto para funciones pesadas, si bien no es la gama tope tanto del procesador como de la tarjeta de video responde bien a las funciones mas exigentes y la tecnologia que tiene es perfecta.",0
"No lagging, great network speed, responsive, just exactly what I need for both work and pleasure.",0
The screen is fantastic,0
Don’t do gaming and don’t have touch screen option,0
Here's what I like-Keyboard-Frame / Bottom / Lid-Size-Came with a zip up sleeveI'm able to do my gaming on the go with this. It has the ports I need and have not had the other issues people are sharing. I am using it with a laptop cooler I bought however.Things I don't like-Backlight bleeding in a few spots-Shipped with LOTS of bloatwareI was able to fix most the issues I had by just blowing away the operating system and re-installing a fresh OS with no bloatware.,0
"Llego con 10 días de anticipación a Chile. Viene en perfectas condiciones, muy contento con la compra.",0
I have bought a lot of Dell computers over the years and they were one of the best ones I have ever owned. But now they are the worst. I have had problems with it ever since I received it. The Dell techs haven't been able to help with the problems. Now they want me to send it to them for repairs and I have only had it a few weeks! I am through with Dell. Don't waste your money. I will be using this as an expensive paper weight and will go back to Toshiba!,0
"OK, it comes with its share of bloatware that takes a bit of combing through to dispose of. But the machine is quick, lightweight, and the screen is crystal clear. I really don't use the camera or speakers, so have withheld comments. My wife has a previous generation of the same laptop, and has used it for a couple of years without problems. This was the main reason I selected this brand and model over similarly priced laptops.",0
I received the laptop very quickly.,0
"This computer was purchased for online school for my son. We used it for 2 months and then put it away for the summer. When it was brought back out for online school again in the Fall, the battery was toast and it wouldn't work. We tried to contact customer service and was given no help at all since we were barely ""out of the refund window"". Would not buy again!!!!",0
About speed it has a very powerful CPU for multitasking.,0
"Ignore the bad review , that guy doesn’t have a clue , , I love it and I’m using it a lot and I recommend you to get the MacBook Air m2, has an amazing screen and its really fast",0

"Aproveche en su momento la promoción. Es una laptop muy ligera y rápida, nunca he tenido problemas ya llevo 2 meses xon ella y super bien, solo es acostumbrándose al teclado en inglés que lo puedes configurar y listo.

My only complaint with this 15.6 inch HP laptop is that the letters and numbers on the keyboard are very difficult to read. I had to buy a keyboard cover with black letters and numbers so I could read the keys.,0

I love my Samsung Chrome Book. Its stylish and easy to use.,0
"Screen has a lot of bleed at the corners. After about 6 months many of my games began to over heat the cpu after an hour and a hslf of play. I cannot even play Alpha Protocol on high game setting. GPU seems cool and the air coming out is cool, but whete vpu is at there is no air flow. Otherwise its an alright computer..",0
Windows on these would not activate.,0
"this is quite a laptop. we've never owned a gaming laptop before, but we've had several gaming PC's over the years, but this was the first gaming laptop we've owned. It's been quite the experience.First and foremost this this is heavy. If you actually are using this while sitting down on the couch, it leaves deep indents in my legs when i sit down with it. On top of that it gets ridiculously hot, really fast. even just browsing around on the internet this thing heats up really quickly. i ended up getting a cooling dock i could put this on when i was sitting with it, but that just made it even more heavy, and the dock didn't do much to alleviate the heat emanating from this thing.This thing also has a Huge power brick. My older dell laptops back in the day had this tiny little power brick, this thing is massive. I get that it must be to power this type of laptop, but sheesh, it takes up a bit of space.I will say it runs really quietly. I was surprised by how quiet it was with how hot this gets. i figured the harder it was working, it would be louder, but it's surprisingly quiet.Now to the gaming aspect. It will run games on the highest settings, and run them well. I had this at one point hooked up to my tv in the living room, so i could play Horizon on steam. It ran this game like a champ. the picture quality on it was amazing. We've played WOW on this and it's run at over 120 fps in the larger cities with a bunch of other characters around. overall playing games on this has been amazing. it really does handle gaming well.it has connection points for 4 USB, 2 Monitors, ethernet, audio jack, and SD card.I think one of my other complaints is how quickly this thing will die on you if not plugged in. the battery gets drained rather quickly, even if all you're doing is browsing on the internet.so overall i would say, that this is a fairly solid laptop, with a few minor issues. we got this for gaming, and for gaming it's great. portability is a bit much with how heavy this thing is, and battery life could be better. but overall, i would recommend this.",0
Very good laptop for the money. For just surfing and basic activities this is a reasonable one.,0
"What a great value. This laptop performs exactly as you'd expect a gaming laptop to perform.Pros: Keyboard Feel. Performance overall Value for the money.Cons: Typical gaming performance battery wise. Gaming PC's and Batteries do not mix well. This is no exception. Runs slightly hotter than is ideal which in turn keeps those fans spinning, which of course isn't as quiet as you might prefer. 70C+ is typical even with a cooling pad. I should add it is summertime in FL so consider ambient temps in mid 70's F.Overall, I am very pleased. I may decide to add a higher quality Thermal paste and I would expect cooler temps. I would also like to add a SSD as 500GB is a little light for a gaming PC. For the $$$ you can't go wrong. It's a beast.",0
Decided to switch from Windows and PC laptops to Apple MacBook and never turning back. Quality hardware and software and looking forward to many years of happy use. I can recommend this product.,0
"I've had this laptop for about a month. I'm a fairly casual gamer, but this runs World of Warcraft, Planet Zoo with all DLCs and Sims 4 with all expansion/game packs plus tons of custom content without even blinking. I run all these games on the highest graphics settings and have had no issues or lag at all. I also use this for work/other tasks. It does exactly what I need it to do. The battery doesn't last super long without being plugged in, but that doesn't bother me. It also doesn't get super hot when running, and there have been times where I have played WOW for like 8 hours straight. Extremely happy with this purchase. For a gaming laptop around $1000, I HIGHLY recommend!!",0
"I think this thing is gorgeous, feels premium, and appears to have solid specs.",0
"Horrible, took 6 and a half hours for it to be ready to get started. Kept on updating for hours on end and makes noises. Horrible purchase, not worth getting at all.",0
This laptop runs very well the last PC games but the battery life has a poor performance.,0
"Love this notebook. Chromebook is a wonderful, simple operating system!",0
"I rarely hate a product. The Lenovo Flex laptop is that rare product. Two deal breakers for me: 1) the flex hinges are insufficient and the screen wobbles and jiggles and must be very strategically braced against something unmovable like a wall. 2) the lip on the edge of the computer casing that your keyboard fits into is sharp, abrasive and irritating to my wrists. It is higher than the surface so it scrapes and rubs on your wrists at all times. It is even irritating through my shirt and sweater let alone bare skin being scraped and abraised. Since this is not a warrant issue Lenovo does not stand behind my purchase. So, never again will I buy another Lenovo product.",0
The trackpad has good sensitivity and response as well.,0
This product was everything that I expected!,0
Works well. Fast delivery.,0
It’s fast,0
"I am writing this review one year after purchasing.At first loved my laptop! So nice, great graphics, got a little hot at times playing games, but that’s to be expected. All was well until one of the fans on the upper right started making horrible noises. When I say LOUD I mean obnoxiously loud. Could barely use the thing and playing games when I would push to talk everyone was like “dang is someone landing an airplane next to you!?” All together the fan stopped spinning and the laptop was getting so hot I couldn’t even touch the upper right part of the laptop. Many jokes were made by gaming friends about me playing World Of Warcraft with my laptop literally in flames.Anyways, to note: laptop was on raised platform with bottom completely exposed to airflow at all times and even added fan mat. This happened within my very first year of owning it brand new.** Acer does NOT pay for your return shipping** and recommended getting full coverage insurance. It cost me over $100 to ship the thing to their Texas facility of my OWN money. Terrible customer service to not provide the customer with a return label for your faulty product. They received my return in Texas February. Over a full month went by and NO UPDATES from Acer I had to call them and ask for anything and they were “waiting on a part.” Finally in APRIL I get a call they’re going to just replace my computer and I think, Well after TWO months I’d hope so. Only to call them back and find out they were giving me a “recertified”....not even a new laptop to replace the over $1k brand new one I purchased here on Amazon LESS than a full year ago. If you google you can read about the other people having fan issues with this laptop—believe them. Very disappointed in Acer on their poor customer service I received.",0
The model I purchased came with the GTX 1060 and can play most games on high,0
"I am very satisfied with this laptop. I use it for gaming, video editing, and watching videos when traveling. The price is amazing for what you get.",0
"This is a fantastic laptop! After driving myself crazy researching Windows Laptops (I've owned Apple products all my life) I just pulled the trigger and bought this. I have been fully satisfied with my purchase so far! It's very light, the screen is great, the keyboard is a perfect size, and it's lightning fast to boot up. I will be using graphic design software on it and I think it will be sufficiently powerful for that and everything else I need it for.",0
"Got this computer and loved it for a day! The next day the bluetooth wouldn't turn on. I talked to Samsung customer service for an hour and they finally told me to take it to be repaired. I wasn't about to spend money repairing a day old chromebook so I contacted Amazon. Within 10 minutes they processed a return for me and shipped out a new chromebook.I've been using my new chromebook for about a week now and really like it. It's a little slow at processing, but everything runs great (and my bluetooth actually turns on!).Overall, good product for the price and I'm happy I got it. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because of the hassle of returning and waiting for a my new one to arrive",0
Bought another laptop first for our graphic designer but the display colors were off and hindered her work. Bought the ASUS VIVOBOOK PRO 15 OLED and the colors are spot on. This is a great laptop for graphic design and more!,0
"This is our third Acer Aspire and I can't say enough good things about it! We purchased this particular laptop for my wife because she decided to go back to work and her Chromebook wasn't enough for what she required. She took to her new laptop immediately and loves it. Easy setup and smooth transition from Chromebook to Laptop/Windows 11. I highly recommend this laptop for those needing a basic, no frills, powerful laptop for everyday use.",0
These were a gift for a school for Children with Autism. They loved them and said they worked perfectly.,0

"Using it now to publish this review. The battery life on this seems good. I'm adjusting to a Chromebook after using a Mac for years. I will say this, if you're not doing video production and just need basic computering, these chromebooks are everything. They're affordable. They are lightweight and easy to carry. Once you get accustomed to the interface, you realize they do everything you need.",0
"It has been the easiest computer to set up in terms of loading software, etc.",0

"Webcam stopped working one day & can’t find the driver. IT couldn’t fix it either… touch screen doesn’t exist, not sure why that’s a metric. Screen quality is good. Battery life is fine until you’ve had it for a year. I don’t leave my laptop on the charger & definitely not when I’m using it…. The battery life has still decreased significantlyI’d return it or have it serviced but I have so much stuff saved on it …",0
I can't even look a websites that a much older laptop would display easily. Pinterest is unviewable with this machine. Unviewable. I need to view and project Pinterest for my painting classes.,0
The monitor is very good. I can play every game without any problem. The images and colors are awesome.,0

"Great computer, inexpensive, and quick",0
"Well keys are bit strange but it's great, no complaints. Added a ssd using the enclosed 2.5 ssd to motherboard attachment and they even had the screws to secure the drive in place with. It's snappy, removed MS Windows and added Pop! OS Linux Distro to it. Just have to enable ACHI mode in bios and turn off secure boot, enable f12 menu. To get to the bios settings just tap F2 at boot. Working fine, glad I purchased.",0
"Processor is 1.6 not 3.4. I'm still trying to figure out how to overclock it but I've never done that before and I have yet to find a way to do it that makes enough sense to me to be able to... This is my first laptop, and I built my desktop. That being said, I don't know the first thing about upgrading laptops. I'm just out of the return period or I would just swap it for something more powerful. Maybe the tools to overclock should have been included if he description is going to suggest it's faster then it is? I guess the review, from this point, depends on how easily (if I am able to) get the processor above the 1.6 GHz.The million dollar question then is: How do I get the processor to overclock to the ""up to 3.40GHz"" per the description of the laptop?",0
The laptop worked well enough for the first 7 months. The touch pad now is mostly unresponsive and occasionally makes commands (gestures and scrolls) on its own. HP drivers don't fix it. Neither does a general device manager>update drivers. I will be looking into a refund or replacement device. Very disappointing,0
"Bought this for my son for his first laptop. Uses it primarily for school, but of course Roblox is the game of choice for his laptop. Screen resolution is not the best for videos, but sufficient for a first laptop. Some keys have popped off and the mouse keys have sunken in. I’m sure it is also my son being a little rough with the laptop. Overall decent for what it was purchased for.",0
"It is a worst laptop I have ever used! I would like to return this laptop. Please, do not buy this one!! If you have enough money to buy it, you'd better to tear that money because it will give you more pleasure.I ordered it on Feb 5, and the return window ended on Mar 10. Surprisingly, after Mar 10, the monitor of the laptop shows nothing! I can't see anything on the monitor so I can't do anything! How can I fix it when monitor shows nothing?? The power button shines when I press the button so, I think it is not a problem of adaptor or power.. I don't know what the problem is. XXXX",0
I had problems with this computer out of the box. It had to restart several times during initial install saying it was repairing corrupted files. It then forced Windows 10 updates to download and install. During the updates the computer froze at 62% for over 6 hours. I will be returning this laptop and finding something better.,0

It is unbelievably disfunctional. I will be returning this thing as soon as possible.",0

I would suggest not buying this particular Chromebook. There is a list of problems associated with it. You can not return it after so many days.,0
"This is a nifty little device, but it doesn't have the key features of your average laptop or desktop computer. Trying to connect other devices like a cell phone is useless, and the apps don't function as well as they do on your smart phone. It's great for kids that don't need to do anything except play the games they play on other devices and stream videos, but if you're looking for something to do personal work or business stuff, you'd be better off spending a little extra on a real laptop. The DEAL BREAKER for me was that the internet connection was very unstable, and I confirmed with my other home devices that my internet was on point.",0
"Shortly after getting this laptop as a gift I started to have random blue screen crashes when waking it up from sleep mode. I could never identify the cause and ended up just dealing with it for a while until slightly more than a year after receiving it when the screen just shut off completely randomly and wouldn't turn back on again, only displaying over HDMI. I tried everything I possibly could without replacing parts (disconnecting and reconnecting the battery/CMOS battery/RAM/screen, updating video drivers, rolling back last windows update) but nothing worked or even shed any light on the problem. Also note if this happens it's impossible to access the BIOS because it can't display over HDMI, thus making it even harder to try and fix the issue. I have never had a laptop randomly break after such a short time, so I can only assume there's a problem with Acer's quality control.",0
I have not used the touch screen but I love the long battery life and it boots up so quickly. Would highly recommend.,0
"I purchased this laptop from Amazon through the reseller in Jan 18. From the outset the sleep function was an issue. About 50% of the time it would wake up, if not, I would have to reboot the machine. Got progressively worse after about a year.At 18 months, the hard drive failed. Got notification on the screen to load operating system.Sent back to HP under extended warranty and was told that the original hard drive was replaced by the seller. They won't cover it. Trying to work through Asurion to cover under their extended warranty. Doesn't look good right now",0
"I had to replace my 10 yr old Toshiba due to Win 7 not being updated any longer, so after much investigation, I went for this sleek HP model. I'm impressed with the screen clarity and crispness when watching movies, but the HD display does prove to be challenging when working with Photoshop 6 and a couple game sites. I have to decrease the screen resolution in order to manage these older programs. I love the backlit keyboard, however, the NumLock doesn't have a light telling me when it's engaged, which is annoying. I saw one review state there were red pilot lights to tell if something is on or off, but I don't have that on this laptop, unless there's something I've missed. The keyboard backlight shuts off after about 30 seconds of not touching the board, which is spooky at first, as I didn't know what I was doing to make it go off. But this is a really nice addition and saves battery life. The construction is sleek and almost too thin for me as I'm afraid I'll bend it when I open it. It also scratches easily if one wears a watch or bracelet, etc. I now take those off when I'm typing. I would have prefered a padded style lid, but I can certainly live with this. I removed the McAfee antivirus as I pay for another program and have never had good results with McAfee. Once set up to my preferences, this laptop really does show it's speed. It surpasses the benchmark test.Boot time is extremely fast, and though it has the least expensive GeForce MX250 graphics card, it performs extremely well. USB ports are fast and have no hesitation in recognizing any flash drives.The sound is acceptable but the description says it has 'immersive sound' but there is no setting to adjust that,. I'd like to know if this is a mistake on the seller's part, Battery life is about 8 hours, from what I've found. All in all, for the price, this is an excellent purchase, even though I have a few things I'd like to see changed.EDIT Aug 28,2020: I've never had a need to use the mic or camera and for the life of me cannot get the mic setup. It says it has a integrated dual array digital microphone but I've no idea how to set it up. I tried to use my old mic/speaker headset with a splitter and can't get Cortana to recognize it. I'm bummed and not quite certain what to do next. Supposedly the 'array' is on the front panel, but I sure don't find it. I didn't buy mine from this particular seller, so will have to contact them. I do find the backlighting very nice but on a silver background the color needs to be blue or red as under lights, the feature is useless.",0
"If you know how, immediately install Windows 10 upon receiving the machine.If not, get someone to do it for you.Get your drivers from ASUS support site and update them as necessary, not all drivers are necessary.This probably goes for any modern-day computing device, to be honest.***Also, delete C-Media Control Panel (Not C-Media Audio Drivers/Service).You've been warned.Top review mentions rollover/ghosting issues. You really won't notice them. W + A + Esc is not a keystroke that is typically used (How would I even position my fingers?).Aside from that, it's a fantastic machine. If you can get the 300Hz screen, get it.",0
"I bought this computer about a month ago, and so far it is working superb. The thing I don't like about it is how little hard drive space there is on it (128gb, and I am almost out :P ) but besides that it starts up quick, functions well, beautiful look, so far everything is working well. I am a college student (computer science) and I play the sims 4 in my free time, along with watch hulu, youtube, ect.I definitely recommend I think it is worth it (in store you are looking at computers about $500 for features such as touch screen and such but my brother disapproves them being a quality computer ie processor isn't too good)",0
Compramos está laptop para nuestro hijo que comenzaba la universidad. Es perfecta para sus trabajos. Altamente recomendado.,0
Great product and great service!!!,0
"This laptop may be good but mine came with busted pixels and the keys half stuck and the other half felt like they were glued down it was a total piece of junk a waste of money very disappointed with this purchase,just left with a ton of regret",0
"it gets pretty noisy when the fan kicks in, but heat kills computers so you have to live with a certain amount of it.",0
It's a lot like using my Android phone,0
Just as described. Perfect,0
Ignore the bad reviews this is a very good laptop . I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a new laptop!,0
"It's my first Asus laptop, it's great. I was also looking at some similarly priced MSI products, but this laptop ticked all the boxes even if it was slightly more expensive. It's worth every penny.The GPU isn't underpowered like most of the laptops in this range, the screen is crisp and the unit itself just feels really sleek. It fits in my Nomatic backpack which is a rare treat - I have had trouble finding laptops with power like this that are slim enough to fit.It runs FFXIV flawlessly, the game looks gorgeous, and it handles all my VMs in the background while I am developing. In all, I love this machine and I think ASUS Tuf gear is my go to from now on. I use it for all sorts of things ranging from writing (the keyboard is laid out really nicely) to programming to gaming to watching videos and it's a pleasure to use for any task. This machine keeps me portable.",0
"Tras casi dos meses de usarla, a resultado ser muy buena. Para estudios es muy buena, la SSD es muy rapida y para juegos es buenisima. el Build quality es muy bueno, no se siente que sea un plastico barato y es mas da un feeling premium.",0
My 12 year old is very satisfied with it. Uses it everyday to play games with friends and to do schoolwork. A little higher priced than I wanted to pay!,0
This is a light and thin laptop,0
"Excelente artículo, estoy satisfecha de haberlo adquirido",0
"While the metal case looks good, it is extremely easily damaged.",0
"Love the design the red keyboard lights are really nice it's really powerfull, easy to upgrade for anyone trying to make their laptop faster and overall very happy for what I got and in terms of price its probably the best really looking forward for a long journey with the Acer Nitro 5.",0
very efficient and manageable,0
"If you're looking for a laptop for college under a thousand this is absolutely the product you should buy.Exceptional battery life.Very lightweight and slim, perfect to slip right into a bag.Good connectivity.Keyboard quality especially the back lighting feels a little cheap but not too bad. You're paying for the internals which for the price of this laptop you're getting a steal.The only major gripe I have about this is that the screen does not get very bright, however its not too big of a deal for me because I mostly keep mine dimmed and the anti glare still makes it usable outside. It would be nice though.Once you get rid of windows 10 bloatware this laptop is great. If you need a laptop for this semester this is absolutely what you should buy.",0
Gaming performance is really good for something this thin with the 2080 Max-Q.,0
"For the price it's perfect. For gaming it will literally run everything. I played cyberpunk ultra at 60fps but also 60fps at medium, I think cyberpunk needs to be optimized. No it can't do ray tracing well, the fps will plummet, if you're okay sub 60fps then go for it. Once you go 144hz you can't go back. The battery obiously not meant for gaming on the go, even if it is a laptop. BUT people have complained about the fans and yes it is loud asf. If you wanna use it for school or basic stuff you can go into battery mode, go into control panel -> hardware and sound -> power options -> change plan settings -> advanced power settings -> configure intel thermal whatever tf -> lower it to 35 -> and PCI express max power savings -> processor power management -> decrease cpu speed before increasing fan. That way it will be quiet while you do non-power needing things like word or take notes at school. Otherwise it will be loud and you will feel awkward during lecture while your laptop reves up sounding like a leafblower",0
"Good looking computer. Very nice for the price BUT if you plan to use it as your primary computer, it is not a good fit. You cannot install software and everything is chrome based!",0
"We purchased this Laptop on 7/16/2018 from Amazon, and it arrived 7/19/2018. We had a startup problem in January, 2019 and called Leveno. We were informed that we were out of warranty. Upon investigation, this product warranty started when it shipped to Etech Galaxy on 6/9/2017. That meant that when we ordered the product, it was out of the one year warranty upon purchase. We have been trying to get the warranty adjusted with Lenovo, but have been unsucessful so far. I have talked with Amazon and Etect Galaxy with no positive results.",0
"The pre-installed software on this computer is helpful, but the bloatware is a nuisance. An innovative idea would be an intelligent software manager that can automatically detect and uninstall unwanted programs.",1
"Very satisfied, would buy again! Shipping was fast, and everything functions properly. Highly recommend, a blessing to my family.",0
"I have been using this laptop for about over a month by now and it's been great! The battery life lets me do work for long periods of time without even having to charge it, but I'd recommend keeping it plugged in so that it operates at the highest functionality. The keyboard is nicely spaced out letting you type easily, however the mouse is slightly on the left side of the laptop base so if you're left-handed it might cause you some trouble.",0
This computer was great for a while. In less than a year of owning it the wifi adapter has completely crapped out.,0
Buen rendimiento,0
"Trying to work with Amazon on a replacement since it's within their 90 days of coverage, but the whole thing just quit and won't turn on. Motherboard or power supply problem I assume. It was ok for what I needed, but not if it doesn't last longer than that. Read about a lot of similar issues when I Googled the problem.",0
"Been using a HP 14-Q007TU since 2014 and it has served me very well. Unfortunately, the keyboard is no longer reliable. Otherwise the Chromebook works just fine. If I attached a keyboard, it will work. But that's a pain. It did not have touchscreen or Google Play Apps. Have been looking for a replacement. The HP 14-ca061dx caught my attention. It ticked the boxes for touchscreen and includes ability to install Google Play Apps. Personally prefer the 14"" units since it makes it easier to work. Found the 11"" units a little fiddly. Hopeful that it will be better than the 14-Q007TU.",0
So for the most part I use this for when I am traveling or out and about for my business. I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Mac's as storage for information so this doesn't use storage much at all. Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. Also the battery for most of the work I am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max. Honestly you can't get too much better for a long lasting Apple hardware focused product.,0
"Great laptop for my needs. I am a light gamer, but mostly use it for editing photos and video. Haven't hade any issues with this laptop and I highly recommend it to anyone.",0
Limited memory makes gaming difficult,0
"very light weight and powerful , the sleek steel series gaming keyboard is great as well.",0
"I have had this model for a little over 2 months and have found it to be an excellent laptop. It is small, light weight and very easy to lug around in my backpack. Yet, for a small lightweight laptop, it has some of the best features I have ever seen for such a small size. First off, with the i7, 16GB of RAM and a 256 SSD, it is blazing fast! I can login in just a few seconds and with the facial recognition, I don'y even have to type in a password. Next is the display, the UHD edge display is bright, vivid and really brilliant with color rendition. The color rendition is really close to perfect. Then comes the keyboard and mousepad. Both are responsive, quick and easy on the fingers for typing and navigating. Also, there is an external MicroSD slot to expand the memory (I use it for movies).As a downside, the laptop seems to ""hick-up"" from time to time with the external mouse not working properly. But it only seems to occur when an update to the BIOS is needed. Its as if the system seems to know there is an update waiting to be installed and the indicator (besides the notification) is the mouse not working properly. Finally, I have not used the built in speakers as I use headphones when playing music or watching a movie.Overall, would I recommend this laptop? Yes, it it worth the costs and it's a delight to use. So much so, I stopped using my Macbook Pro (13 inch) as well as my Thinkpad X1 Carbon (6th generation).",0
"The laptop is relatively light and thin, and works great. I got the 500GB SSD with 16MB memory.",0
Best deal I could find and it does not disappoint. The only thing I dont like is the screen is always at 144hz. Being able to set it to 60 as well should save a bit of battery life.,0
The battery never seems to reach 100%,0
"MSI customer support is a sham. Left side cooling fan seized after 3 months of use. Contacted support and they want $20 to send a replacement fan that will take 1 month to arrive, but the replacement fan on Amazon is $12 prime. This is a complete waste of money. I should have stayed with my ASUS ROG.",0
"I'm not happy at all with this product, it broke within a couple months. It was used seldomly and kept in great condition, and I am currently unable to return it. I really wish I could get my money back as it seems to have been faulty. Will definitely spend the extra dollars for higher quality electronics in the future.",0
"This computer is good if you're a very low-maintenance web browser, but even then, I find it gets horribly slow much too quickly, even for 4GB RAM. This was my first experience with ChromeOS and will more than likely be my last, but I could see how it would be more than enough for a lot of people. Good gift idea for an older relative who goes online to read the news and such.",0
"Okay, so I was hesitant on this laptop because some of the reviews mentioned bad temperatures. I was concerned with getting a laptop with bad thermal paste (which does happen). However, the laptop came super well! Lots of reviewers fail to mention the healthy temperature levels. Idle should be 30-45c. And under full load it should never go past 85c. EVER!!! If it goes past, it's likely it could either be, 1: Bad Thermal Paste/application, 2: Bad Fans, 3:Lack of contact with HeatSinks. 4: Bad Ventilation. If buying new, and the temps aren't matching, exchange it, as shipping can sometimes damage components. Laptops generally require maintenance. If heavy using, 1-2 Years. Make sure those temps never go past 85c. Over time you will have to replace the thermal paste or fans may give out. Grizzly Kryonaute is the best paste. Those are very very easy fixes. Just keep that in mind when buying ANY gaming laptop! If you are scared to tamper with it, buy some insurance and send it to acer. (Continuing with the review......) With poor ventilation I was reaching 85c. I bought a laptop cooler, the IETS with rubber rings. I'm getting incredible temperatures! Never going past 78c! This laptop is very heavy on proper Ventilation. If you look at the design there are a ton of vents from the bottom that push out through the top of the keyboard. S1I think a laptop cooler is necessary if you're gonna be gaming. This thing is incredible. I'm running games on High/Max settings (Elden Ring, warzone, apex) and getting awesome frames. I upgraded the ram to 32GB and this thing is a work horse. Dual rank 3200 32gb ram will increase your frames by about 15, and more opened tabs!! ;) I also installed a 2tb samsung ssd. (Which I highly recommend you do) It is much easier to install an nvme than the SATA one. So I would recommend getting a m.2 nvme. Opening the back piece for upgrades can be a challenge. There Is a trick to it, and it's likely you will break something if you don't get it right. So don't force it! So be very careful and gentle when doing it. Use a pick to slowly Pry it open. Pull from the vents back side. The battery can get kinda hot too. So make sure it's in a good spot. You can also set the battery charge level to 80% for longer battery lifespan. That's pretty much it! It's an amazing laptop for the price and power! Bang for your buck! Happy gaming!",0
"Item is listed as new and shipped from Amazon. The unit I received came with the standard laptop box packed in a much larger box with NO additional packing to protect it. It had a ""second life"" used/refurbished sticker affixed to it. I looked up the serial number on HP's website and sure enough a warranty had already been registered for it 3 months ago.If you're interested in this laptop, I'd suggest you look for it elsewhere. I can't trust Amazon to send a new unit.",0
Exelent gaming performance in a thin and light chassis.,0
Worst mistake I made,0
Worked just fine.,0
"Runs very fast, sleek design. Overall awesome",0
Excelente servicio y maquina vino en perfecto estado,0
"I’m a personal stylist, and my company uses the Chrome platform, so I needed a computer that performs well and has great resolution. I love the touchscreen feature-it makes it perfect to pinch and zoom I’m on items I need to see closer. Set up was a breeze. If you need a basic computer for basic internet work, this is a great pick for you!",0
"I stopped buying HP in 2008 after purchasing one of their top-of-the-line laptops and having nothing but trouble with it from day one. With that I had to struggle with support several times over the course of the next three months before they agreed to take it back and replace it -- when the replacement arrived, I sold it on ebay and decided not to buy HP anymore.Fast forward 13 years and I figured it was time to try them again for one of my new employees. We've been using Dell but I figured I'd save a few hundred and try HP again... a regrettable decision. She's had to call support multiple times and is losing work time trying to chase down HP's quality issues.Unfortunately I can't return it at this point and will probably wind up replacing it before the year is out. Looks like it's time to go on another 13 year hiatus from HP. Just glad I got my reminder this way instead of deploying a bunch of these at client sites and having a support nightmare.I'm giving it 2 stars, because the casual user may find it sufficient...but if you expect to use this 8 hours a day, you may want to consider a different brand.",0
This was a gift for my son. He loves his new computer,0
"This laptop performs phenomenally! Capable of running Elden Ring at 1440p High settings @60fps! That’s incredible and I love it. Currently using the laptop for on the go gaming and editing whilst also using it on downtime with my 4K 55” and it works perfect! This thing can run a surprising amount of games at 4K and 1440p perfectly fine. The system gives a lot of fan settings to really tune it up to how you want it to play. Extreme mode is the best for absolute gaming but it can get very loud, I recommend default of Quite if you plan to just watch YouTube or something. Build quality is strong and the keyboard is great! Beautiful system all around.",0
Bought this for my 86yoa dad. Simple and nothing complicated about it. He has thoroughly enjoyed it,0
"A good, low cost, basic computer.",0
Very slow.,0
"I bought this for one of my younger sisters a few months ago and she's loved it so far. It runs the games she wants and she can use it for coding, for her schoolwork, and other general usage too. We've placed games against each other online and this is definitely quieter than my Alienware (Alien v. Predator--I couldn't help myself when looking for a laptop for her and saw that this one was good). That said, my alien has two power intakes for more intense gaming and it's noticeable if I'm doing a lot, so it has the advantage there.This Predator Helios is a great beginner gaming laptop for anyone too lazy (like me and my sister) to build their own. I'm sure she'll want something better latter on, but its great for her teenage self.",0
Great model for the price. Does everything I want it to.,0
"Two days after opening it, I'm already having issues with it getting stuck when turning on. Was told to reset it, but after doing so Microsoft edge won't work and I cannot download any other browser. I googled the issue and found other people complaining about similar issues. Bummer.",0
"for some odd reason it just stopped working.chromebook powers up, no display even on an external monitor.i got cheaper laptops that are still running after 4yrs. then there's also the lack of documentation for troubleshooting.lesson learned, these devices are not meant to last.",0
"It has a large trackpad, which is godsend for someone who usually uses Macs.",0
"Laptop quality is pretty good. The IPS panel pairs well with windows 11. I would recommend going for the 16gb version as with all laptops. 8gb of memory is not enough for most takes in 2022. As I have pointed that out. This computer comes from HP with an insane amount of bloatware built in. The system will consume about 4gbs of memory just being turned on, and with the bios locked down. The average user will not be able to wipe the drive and freshly install windows.The I5 processor is surprisingly good. Averaging only a 4? decrease in performance against the I7 model.Not suitable for gaming IMO. But I would recommend to most pc users. Power users will know this is not what they are looking for.For price- it's a fabulous deal",0
"I love it! Compact, lightweight, fits in my purse. Good quality.",0
"Update April 2019. Stay away from this garbage laptop!! Asus is really careless. Another insane problem! The screen keeps dimming, and there is NO WAY TO STOP THAT. I checked a dozen forums, spent many hours of my time trying to solve this maddening issue. I toggled ALL of the relevant windows settings (including the explicit setting to stop dimming), and NOTHING WORKS. They have a stupid sensor, which in it's great wisdom, thinks it's necessary to dynamically adjust screen brightness, CONSTANTLY. Truly a first class idiotic feature, prime example of useless feature creep that interferes with basic function. So unless you want to constantly think you're going blind, stay away from this garbage and save yourself literally a big headache.I'm disappointed by the trackpad on this laptop and may be returning the unit. I've tried every possible trackpad setting adjustment, and the cursor is always a bit off. Over the course of working on it throughout a day, this ends up exhausting me. You spend your energy fighting the cursor.I purchased an Asus N56V way back in 2012. It has a MUCH better trackpad response. Note to Asus: NOTHING is more important than the responsiveness of the trackpad! DO NOT skimp on that like you did with the 640X480 nearly unusable webcam. Nobody wants to use an external mouse or external trackpad. That is totally clunky and goes against the whole point of a portable laptop. Beyond that, it's not a bad machine, but this trackpad issue is really a deal killer.Response to response: Your trackpad should work well out of the box! I shouldn't have to spend my time downloading all kinds of software to tweak your product. Ridiculous comment trying to blame my internet connection. The trackpad cursor is wobbly! I've tried disabling all the multi-touch features, and just using the most basic trackpad function, i.e, for pointing the cursor. Nope, the cursor is always a little bit lagging and wobbly, which is maddening after a while.Downgrading my review to 1 star. I've really tried to ""get used to"" this trackpad, but it is total trash. It is beyond maddening. It's always off, always lagging a tiny bit, but enough to really drive you crazy and make it difficult to be productive. It unnecessarily adds a lot of frustration into your work. Asus, this was NOT the place to skimp!",0
"It's a good laptop, but I have a few problems with it now after 2 years of light use. The first is audio: more often than not, I will have to hard reboot several times in order to get audio/microphones to work. This works with the original speaker audio and any headphones I try to connect to it, bluetooth or otherwise. The second is microphone quality. It's extremely quiet on the computer, but when I connect any headphones to it (ones that work fine anywhere else), I have to yell into them in order to have the other person faintly hear my voice. I've messed around with every setting in the computer and taken it to tech support, no luck. Otherwise it's a decent computer.",0
"This laptop was everything I had hoped for and it is incredibly packed with features for anywhere near the price. Since I'm a Prime member, it arrived in two days flat. Nice! The packaging and shipping was excellent, the laptop box itself is packed in its slim cardboard packing with a perfect fit and then packed in an outer box as well. Absolutely no damage, dents or bruises at all. AC Adapter and minimal documentation included (no media). There's really nothing else needed, it appears to have one of the newer kinds of battery that's internal and not user changeable, and it charges well. On the initial screens you can choose to turn OFF all the slide controls that offer to send info to Microsoft. (recommended).One thing you have to be prepared for due to Windows 10, is that as soon as you reach the place where you give it whatever means of internet connection you use - it takes over and begins the update cycle. The large 3GB Windows 10 ver 1709 takes some patience, so just let it do it's thing and give it as much as several hours. You want to make sure that it's all up to date first before you go in and tweek things. So don't begin that process until you can spare several hours, and you'll be in good shape.It came with what I'd call minimal bloatware. Some folks want that stuff, I did not. I uninstalled xbox gaming, MS Store, an eBay shortcut and several other items I had no use for. The 30-day eval of MS Office wasn't going to do me any good so I uninstalled that as well. Less than 10 minutes lost to cleanup - no problem. Looking at the add/remove programs listing in the Control Panel, you can see it comes with the usual nice collection of Acer utilities, so don't remove those. And when you do finish the installation and have it configured just the way you want, take the time to do a Windows Image backup to an external USB drive, along with a Restore DVD, that's your very best means of recovery later on if you ever crash your drive.This is a very well-made laptop and the best by far of any of the several former Acer laptops I've owned in the past. Sturdy, powerful, loaded with all the latest and fastest ports, (you have to love the 802.11ac WiFi, it's a screamer) - along with a 1TB drive, plenty of RAM and expandable to a whopping 32GB - it's a great buy and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone wanting high performance in a low-cost package. Everyone has their preferences, true - but I give this model 5 stars for Amazon's packing, shipping, and Acer's very best product line yet. And I'm an IT Professional of some 24 years, so I get my hands on some very top-dollar laptops for business. I think you'll be pleased with this one!",0
"I got this for my less technologically-inclined mother to use for basic browsing/videos/netflix/email etc. and it's perfect. It took about one whole minute to set up, it's responsive, and I found the build quality/sturdiness impressive for the price point. Almost wish I'd bought one for myself too!",0

"Great laptop. Construction seems pretty sturdy for a plastic body. Have only used for a few hours but so far it seems like a computer that has great power and speed for its price point. The keyboard keys have a good action to them new, but we’ll see how they hold up as the keyboard gets broken in. I was surprised how big the charger is, but overall the entire computer with charger is still not that heavy. Cooling seems good so far. I think the only thing I’m not a big fan of is the big logo on the front looks a bit cheap, but honestly this doesn’t effect the quality of the computer as a whole. Would definitely recommend.",0
"Having used HP laptops for years, through various operating systems, I decided to try a Chromebook because I simply can't stand Windows 10. It's slow, ponderous, and takes forever to update. The price of this computer was a definite plus. It's quick and agile, and I'm very comfortable with the Android OS. It took fewer than 5 minutes to set up this computer, from the time I plugged it in until I turned it off. For the big stuff I still have my desktop computer (also Acer), but I can see myself using this laptop gem for a lot more tasks. I feel this was a wise decision and purchase.",0

"Absolutely awful computer. First the network card completely fails after 2 months, now the battery won't charge at all, even with a brand new charger. The laptop is nothing more than an expensive brick now.

"Chromebook fanatic. Have several. This is an upgrade from 3 yr old 15"" Chromebook. Faster. Brilliant colors. Improved keyboard. For $200 you can't go wrong. REVISED to 3 stars. Downgraded for low screen resolution. While it is faster than my 2 yr old Chromebook with same size screen the resolution is 1366 x 768 vs 1920 x 1080 on the older computer.At first I thought it was just my eyes but I have tweaked as much as possible and it still isn't as clear as I would prefer.I have owned several Acer's over the last few years but this may be my last one. Asus is (in my opinion) a much better computer albeit at a higher price. About $150 more than this Acer but it comes with more storage and a higher resolution screen. It is also faster than the Acer.",0
"Excellent bang for buck. This is running Final Fantasy XV, Dragon Age Inquisition, Star Wars the Old Republic, Skyrim Special Edition highest graphics all on no problem. Tons of space, awesome backlit keyboard, light for a gaming laptop, fans work excellent... best decision I've made. Though I haven't purchased the game myself other owners online says it does well with Cyberpunk too. Honestly for under 1500, best gaming laptop you can get. Some reviews show that Lenovo doesn't offer good support so I immediately tested that out, I had excellent respond time and good customer service. I'll update this review in a few months to see how it's still performing!",0
Great product for the price,0
Perfect Laptop. Very beautiful design.,0

"I like this laptop spec for spec but I am not sold on the 2-in-1 concept. Its nice to have to the flip and touchscreen option but I feel like I've outgrown tablets so this is not a huge selling point for me. It amy be for you.(+) Lenovo is a strong quality brand, and this machine 'feels' tough right out of the box.(+) I believe this Lenovo laptop will last a while given the 8th gen processor and build quality.(-) It's heavier and thicker than I would like though. I have a cheaper 15.6 inch Acer that is thinner and lighter. BUT I am guessing the touchscreen and metal casing is the reason why.(+) A majority of price tag is the Intel processor and SSD drive. In my opinion, you definitely do want the Intel processor but a 3 series is more than sufficient and the SSD is not required. In fact for Windows machines, I would argue you need the 1 TB hard drive to handle all the Windows 10 bloatware and updates.(-) Updates - yes a new Windows 10 machine sucks to get up and running. I spent a day with this laptop installing all the necessary updates.(-) It's unclear which Lenovo Active Pen works with the Flex series, (-) I downloaded the Flex 6 user manual to get more info on which Active pen to use, and on page 16, all it says ""Select model is equipped with the Lenovo Active Pen, to use it, refer to the following illustrations."" No reference to which pen works nor does the Lenovo website.I would buy this laptop but the cheaper version if and only if I was looking to consolidate my tech.",0
"Era lo que esperaba, bastante satisfecho la verdad por el precio",0
"This is my first non-Mac computer in 15 years, and all I can say is Apple lost my business for not making a 15"" MacBook Air. Hopefully some day in the near future. The Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro is a wow machine though!!To have a like for like comparison I bought a MacBook Air (13.3"") and The Galaxy Book2 Pro (15.6"") together ... and the 15.6"" Samsung is lighter than the 13.3"" MacBook Air!! Let that sink for a bit. The dog-eat-dog world has gotten so crazy that 15.6"" laptops have gotten lighter than 13.3"" Ultra-premium laptops!!! What a wonderful time to be alive :)About the Samsung Galaxy Book2Pro:The Pros:1. Great Display - Easily better than the MacBookAir (No, I don't mean that the blacks are better, or picture is sharper. Just that a 15.6"" inch AMOLED display will any day blow away a 13.3"" inch Retina display. Not because is AMOLED is better than Retina, but that 15.6"" vs 13.3"" is a hump that you can not cross.2. Insanely light weight: This is perhaps the lightest laptop that I have handled. The fact that it is 15.6"" laptop is insane!3. Noise: I believe that there is a fan, however I have never heard it. So far I use it to Code - AI/ML and consume media (Hi-Def movies/Series)4. Keyboard and track-pad - High-quality keyboard and trackpad. I don't click on the track-pad, but tap instead. That makes the experience ultra-premium and noiseless.5. Connections: While it is true that anyone plonking 4 figure $$ for a laptop, can also buy $20-$30 connectors, it does feel good to have a HDMI out built in along with 2 USB-Cs, 1 USB-A, and one micro-SD card. This an AHA moment - with the MicroSD card slot, you can expand your storage by orders of Terabytes as Micro-SD cards become increasingly cheaper.The meh:1. Battery life: - I am not one to drain my battery life entirely or reduce brightness to reduce recharge frequencies. As such I see that I have to recharge at the end of 8-9 hours. Not majorly complaining, but I would say that it will worsen with age.The Bad:1. The Stickers: It is down-right fugly when there are stickers on your laptop. I have one for energy star and one for Intel Evo. I wish these things would stop on Windows laptops.2. The speakers: I cant really hear a difference in loudness as compared to my MacBook Air, but these speakers are not very loud.3. The Hinge: The screen hinge wobbles (ever so slightly). It remains set once the angle screen angle is fixed, but I was disappointed to find screen-wobble, having come from the Mac-world.Overall - Is this a MacBook killer? - Depends. You can get a fully souped-up MacBook Air - 8 Core CPU and 8 Core GPU, 16GB Ram and 1 TB SSD for $1650 (at the time of writing). The Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro costed me about $1150. While the MacBook Air is fan-less, and will have more power and battery life - It will always be heavier than the Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro, and have a smaller screen, not to mention $500 more expensive. That is what it comes down to. I am going to keep this laptop, since as of now Apple has nothing to compete in the 15"" ultra-light, ultra-premium laptop space.",0
Amazing FPS it runs so beautiful. One down side is smalls storage but makes it fun to buy a bigger ssd and do cool customization,0
"I don't use laptops very frequently; for some reason, I just can't seem to put my phone or iPad down to grab my laptop. It's not necessarily because laptops aren't great, I'm just lazy. I recently gave my wife my MacBook Air because I just didn't use it much, but seeing this Acer with the EVO i7 badge and 8 GB of ram was too hard to pass up, as it was what I was looking for when I ultimately decided on the unneeded 16GB ram MacBook Air: the 8GB of ram is MORE than enough for my daily tasks, and is typically good for random gaming (take the horror game Visage: it requires 6, prefers 8, so this is right in the wheelhouse).The laptop feels efficient, programs open really quick, the keyboard is highly responsive and, though there's a bit of a click, it's the perfect amount for someone that doesn't like those loud programming keyboards but also doesn't like those whisper quiet ones that some tablets come with.The appearance is basic on the outside but sharp on the inside; the white/silver keyboard is just plain nice to look at, and having white as the backlight color is especially nice at night.As for the battery, that's an easy 5* for me. I constantly put my computer in sleep and come back like 24-48 hours later. Doing that repeatedly for a week, I still opened this thing up to have over 2.5 hours of battery life left. I had this computer for at least 2 weeks and have plugged it in literally ONE time, at the very beginning. Wow. I'm still at 2hr and 3min battery left, and that's 22%.Overall, I don't know if someone that uses and abuses their laptops, like I used to in College, will gravitate towards this Acer, because I'm not terribly familiar with what they're looking for. If you're a developer, you probably need double the ram. If you're a hardcore gamer, you'll probably need double the ram AND a better graphics card.BUT:If you're a fairly regular laptop user who likes lightweight units, doesn't need a touch screen, still likes multiple USB ports, and likes a hefty battery life, along with half a TB of space, sure, you might find something cheaper if you research, but from my recent experience with no research into comparable units, and just the testing I've had with this, I would recommend the Acer for sure. As someone who bought a MacBook Air with the M1 Chip and 16GB of ram, but just didn't use it that frequently, this Acer has more than taken it's place. I didn't need that much ram. This one does everything I need.",0
The HP laptop has great screen resolution. The SSD and processors worked well. We ended up returning in because my wife couldn't stand the high pitch whine of the fans. The seller took it back with no issues. We hope HP can solve this issue in the future.,0
Paid $10 more than the original Acer Chromebook I bought years ago. 10 times better.,0
"I’m sure it’s good for some, just not me. Pretty slow on a very fast connection. Can not use iTunes without first dropping into Google Play from a PC or Mac. MS Office Online version pretty much not useable for lite business even. It’s a nice looking package but lacks basic use ability. Charger fitting very tiny and was obvious it would not last. Returned for full refund. Seller was great!",0

"Loads windows and games very rapidly. Excellent graphics.I bought two of these: one with a single 512 GB drive, and the second, ordered on this same page, came with two puny 256 GB drives. That means if I want to increase storage, I have to toss the 2nd drive for something of a reasonable storage capacity.Just thought you ought to know.June 30 21 Edit: Well, the little C: drive SSD filled up. I tried to use the 256 GB D drive but Unreal wouldn't install and complained of a drive error. Now the D is failed completely. Fine. it's was always useless. So I bought a 1 T SSD drive that was recommended in ""Questions"" and a screw driver to go with it. Getting those 11 little screws out was impossible - they were put in with Blue Locktight which is supposed to be removable but these screws are too small. Decided to return the whole thing because I'm close to the return date and I shouldn't have to put up with a ""not as advertised"" product with a bad drive that was DOA.My daughter is happy with her Lenovo though. She got one with the 512 GB drive, but she did fill it up with games. I'd be happy as well, if I just had one working 512 GB drive and I could open it for upgrades",0

"I got this laptop over a month ago and I'm very impressed. Handles everything I throw at it like a dream. Thermals are pretty decent as well. The 144Hz screen is nice and smooth and is of good quality. Biggest plus is the that the 2070 in this laptop is a 115W instead of a Max-Q 85W so the performance is exceptionally good. I definitely recommend buying this laptop. Only ""Gripe"" is the battery life, but considering that it is a gaming laptop with powerful components, it goes without saying that it's gonna suck through the battery because of it's powerful internals.",0

"Purchased the unit from Amazon US through Amazon Singapore .After waiting for weeks, the laptop arrived and found the unit neither had touch screen working nor the Screen Pad which were shown in the laptop specifications. Phone call to Asus assistance ( Mr George and later Mr Jason) provided no assistance for two days in a row. Took the unit to Asus Bugis junction Service Centre and after check on serial no, they told the unit sent to us does not have screen pad or touch screen features. Now we are to box back the unit and make arrangements for airfreight back to USA.What a blunder to rely on ASUS.I will not recommend purchases from this company. Why not service centre would handle return and refund when they clearly knew their US counterpart had blown it all",0
Awesome basic laptop for university students doing absolutely basic typing and reports on MS Office and web browsing! It's so cheap and works great for all my student needs! Battery life is amazing! Used it for 3 days straight without a charge!,0
"This laptop is an amazing value. I am extremely pleased that I purchased this.Gaming: I have been playing Total War Rome 2 on ultra settings smoothly; it runs GTA V and Skyrim maxed out too. Recently I got into Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, which is gorgeous on this laptop.Work: I am also a college student, and this machine is amazing for that too. Its start up time and loading time for everything is very fast, the keyboard is crisp and responsive, and the keyboard lights up in case you need to work at night with no additional lights.Cons: when not plugged in the battery life is not amazing, maybe about ~2-2.5 hours typing a paper while listening to YouTube, but not terribly short.Overall: 5/5, would highly recommend.",0

"This new ASUS model was just what I wanted, a 4-core i7, 16GB of RAM, 4GB of graphics, 256GB of SSD and 1TB of HDD, as well as its connections 3.0 and 3.1 Type C.It is very thin and very light, with an incredible touch, and built in golden, brutal aluminum.The screen is of very good quality, although you will always have to have 100% brightness.Its keyboard is very pleasant to the touch and also its backlighting is adjustable.The S.O is installed as standard on the SSD, in my case, it starts in 12 seconds.Nothing overheats, its ventilation system is excellent, and almost the best of all is its audio system, which is from the same manufacturer that collaborates with BMW, ""Harman / Kardon"", they have a brutal clarity and a very powerful sound.I ordered the laptop from Spain with the express delivery, and despite having been importing, I have not had any problem with the customs, everything has been very easy and in a very short time.Who buy it from Spain, who knows that it does not have the letter ""ñ"", but there are ways to use it, I would recommend putting it as a Spanish language, and as a keyboard the ""international American"" to use the keyboard correctly and to the Time to write allows you to put the accents correctly.In short, it has been a great purchase, very happy, and for a much lower price than in Spain, where the same model would come for € 1700-1900 ($ 1,900-2,100), and thanks to the imported order, the total cost including The customs fees to Spain has been € 1170 ($ 1330).",0
"Just like so many other reviewers have pointed out, the audio quality is terrible. Honestly, my phone has better audio than this laptop. With some videos, I had to put my ear real close to the laptop to try to hear. I returned it and was charged $125.00 ""restocking fee.""Honestly, this seems like the vendor gets his profit margin no matter how bad of a product he sells.Lesson learned. I'll never purchase another computing device off of Amazon.",0

"Bought this laptop and a 32gb ( 16 x 2 ) memory kit. Installed Solus Linux and I could not be happier.Love the keyboard and the overall profile of this laptop. It's not heavy and is very thin for a 15.6"" laptop. It does have a budget NMVe m.2 drive, so I will upgrade that at some point for some additional, faster storage.Linux runs great on this laptop. All of the function keys work ( screen brightness, volume, etc ). An AMD Ryzen 7 quad-core with 8-threads and 32gb is quite a bit of resources for Linux. Time to install Docker and get to work !!!",0
"Ya lo llevo usando algunos meses y puedo decir que es muy buen equipo, las temperaturas son relativamente bajas, se comporta muy bien en multitareas, en los juegos a configuraciones maximas no va a tirones, en ram vas sobrado, aunque se puede ampliar, pero no veo razon para aquello, ademas lo ocupo para trabajar, proceso imagenes de drones, grandes cantidades y los tiempos son bastante acotados, es muy buena maquina, tanto para trabajo como para juegos.",0

"I got a great deal from Amazon on this good basic, but slow laptop. I added $25 8GB RAM also purchased on Amazon that really increased speed. I'm not a techie by any definition. It's very easy to do, just watch a YouTube video. I'm 65, so you can do it too. I only use the laptop for email, browsing and a few games. So nothing fancy. I would say it's not for hardcore gamers.",0

"Ight y'all gonna be straight up... This computer is solid for its price. The build quality feels... Mmm... Just flat out great. Solid, but not too heavy, but it feels heavy ya know?Battery is OK, little on the shorter side but it has a 3050ti in it and the ryzen 5800h really helps keep it going. Its a ""gaming"" laptop so the 5ish hrs I got with mid screen brightness and multitasking was plenty for me.The screen BTW, it's beautiful. I'm a huge fan of high quality IPS flicker free (DC dimming) displays and this one is probably one of my favorite screens I've used. I think people seriously underestimate how messed up flickering lights at their brains for many hours a day is. Its best to avoid in all places possible and this laptop supports that.I have a ryzen 3600 and 1660ti in my main rig and this thing matches it for sure, even outperforms or slightly but haven't had enough time with it to say for sure about all that.Generally the keyboard is awesome and comfortable to use, the track pad is responsive and thank God they put a dedicated function key to disable it if you don't need it... They have an electronic camera emable/disable switch.For gaming it's a 3050ti 4gb for my version with a ryzen 5800h, it can run pretty much every major modern game with the exception of super high video memory titles, in which case you lower your settings a bit.As a workstation (why I got it), beast mode. Things a tank. Sound quality on headphones and speakers are exceptional (reminder it's a laptop), camera is decent (what do you expect on a laptop?), and overall the machine is eating everything I'm throwing at it and handling it quite snappily.Overall I'm very happy with this machine. If I run into issues this review will be updated but none yet.",0
"When it was working it was great, but without any promoting or warning the screen just straight up refused to work. 2 stars because the RMA department was helpful.",0

"So far this has been a nice laptop, easy to set up, and runs pretty quick. I like the fact that it comes with the newer wi-fi 6 ax adaper. Games run well, with overall useable framerates. No surprises, it's not a top-end machine, so it won't run the newest AAA games on the 'Ultra' settings, but at the MSRP price (or below in my case), it's a good deal for the overall package. I suggest buying an additional 8GB of RAM as well as an additional SSD hard drive to round out the machine... both can be purchased separately on Amazon at good prices and easily added. (Plenty on vids on the tube to help if you need it). I wish the keyboard was RGB instead of just red, but the red is nice, and dims so you can use at night without issue. I give it 4 stars overall since it's not a 'hardcore' gaming machine, but for value, it's a 5 star deal (as long as you don't choose to overpay in these odd times).",0
Keeps shutting down when not go on the internet,0
The laptop is poorly refurbished with just stickers to hide the wear and tear marks.Processing is too slow if you are using it for anything except normal browsing.

"I'm very pleased with the quality of this Chromebook. Fortunately I haven't had any issues staying connected to wifi as others have had mentioned in their reviews. My biggest concern was going from a Windows OS to a Chrome OS, but it wasn't a difficult transition at all.

I recommend this Chromebook to anyone who needs a simple laptop to search the internet, watch movies, listen to music or homework.",0
"We bought this laptop for our son to join in gaming with us and for him to use for school. It has been great for gaming. The graphics are beautiful and there is no lag.

"This laptop worked great until it overheated and burned, melting the bottom of the laptop. This could have been a serious tragedy if I had been asleep or if I'd left the laptop unattended. Luckily I was home and smelled the burning plastic before anything else caught fire.This review is not intended to be a reflection of Amazon nor its customer service. Rather, the manufacturer and their poorly, cheaply constructed product. The manufacturer (Acer) offered to take a look at it and try to fix it under warranty, but asked me to pay for all the safe packaging, ship the laptop, and to wait 7-10 business days for turnaround. I need it for work. So I took it upon myself to take it to a tech repair shop, and when they opened it up, they found a lot of things held together with electrical tape, corroded cpu/USB parts, and a heat sink that fans into the laptop itself. Where does all that heat go? No wonder this thing overheated. Please, save your money and invest in a manufacturer that won't cut this many corners. Such a safety hazard and I can't believe their poor response. I know you get what you pay for, but even with a low-budget electronic device, this should never happen.",0
"This is a good budget/starter laptop tthat has great potential. I like the screen size and the fact that this is quick for having a lower tier CPU. I immediately upgraded the SSD to a larger 256 GB Drive. I have never personally had an Acer laptop but I have used them and worked on them in the past and this is one is on par with my previous experiences. The screen is bright and sharp and the OS is quick, at least until it gets bloated with all the junk we acquire. Over all, this is a really snappy machine and I'm pleased with it's performance. I tried set this to dual boot with Linux but I couldn't get it running right so I went back to just Windows. This is a great budget laptop with a crisp display, which is really nice for us older folks! I'll come back to update my review if anything changes my opinion on this unit",0
"I use a Macbook for work because I'm a photographer/layout designer so I need my colors to be spot on, BUT I was really missing out with so many games being Windows only. My priority wasn't graphics - it was something that would run well and not break the bank. With a protection plan and tax this ended up being ~$800 and I love it! On my Mac even Darkest Dungeon was slow, but now I can easily play Witcher 3, Vampyr, and Genshin Impact (don't laugh at me - my sister got me into it and now we're constantly competing to outlevel each other :D)I think if you're one of those folks who builds your own machine or gets into debates about the best processors, then this may not be quite up to your standards. But if you're like me and you literally just want something that'll run your games smoothly and act as a backup for any word processing or basic business stuff you need to do, it's a solid machine. Starts up quick, runs beautifully, and I personally think the red keyboard backlight is cool.These are the reasons it hasn't replaced the Mac entirely:1) Poor battery life. (Maybe a couple of hours.)2) Really heavy compared to a Macbook Air!!!! If you're a student looking for a campus laptop, take this into consideration because I can tell you from experience that carrying a heavy bag for four years will give you at least one touchy shoulder...3) The color scheme is off. I've tried manually adjusting it but I'm spoiled with the Retina display.All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase - AND I didn't have to drop 2k. Win win! I will definitely consider Acer products for the future, both for gaming and business. (Although I kinda like keeping the two machines separate.)",0
I replaced on older 2009 MacBook Pro with this new model from Apple. It has the new M1 chip and it is fast. For the type of things I do in a home office this is lightning fast. I don't do a lot of editing of videos or play video games on it so my work load is pretty mundane compared to others. I like it though because it is lightweight when I take it to my den or on a trip in my computer bag. The battery lasts a long time and the keyboard is very responsive. Love the screen clarity. I have not found any of my regular apps having any difficulty running on the new chip. I did set up a new camera connection app to see how it would do and had no issues either. It is running in the background and when they update to work specifically with the new chip it should work even better. I don't have any negatives with this computer. I have been an Apple fan for several years now and so use to it that I have great difficulty when trying to use a Window's based computer.,0
Vibrant display with good viewing angles thanks to the IPS display.,0
"Video quality is amazing even though I’m used to glossy and not matte screens. All games played perfectly and never noticed loud fans or extremely hot exhaust. Suggest replacing NMVE with WD 850 Black’s or at least a 2TB as second drive for games that will fill the 1TB which the OEM is too slow. NIC has no link lights. Lighted KB is cool but if left on all the time it drains the battery even not gaming. Power supply is large but Lenovo’s is XXXL. I recommend only if home use 75% and with a mouse as you will have to bring the power supply and recharge. Even in MUX mode using CPU not GPU for graphics. I don’t like the pad, although you can do 2 or 3 finger scrolling but clicking takes too much pressure.",0

"Review by Joey ""Vice-grip"" Lupoli: While this HP computer isn't cheap (price wise), it still appears well within the range of price-to-quality ratio. And this computer is fast, real fast. Almost as speedy as Glen Ford in ""The Fastest Gun Alive."" (Yeah, I'm not a college kid). LOL!Also, the speakers provide excellent audio quality, and the keyboard back-light option is well designed and bright.The screen clarity and colors are are nice and sharp too. I'm also very impressed with the DVD loading and playing system. The DVD tray and loading mechanism is quiet and smooth--not loose or flimsy at all.The wrap-up on this model is: here's a very hardy HP computer, which in my opinion, is worth more than the asking price, simply because it appears to have been built to last for a very long time. I think this make and model computer will outlive it's pricier competitors. So if you're shopping for a fast and sturdy/reliable computer, this is the model I'd recommend!",0
No number touch pad as advertised,0
"Used for gaming and personal home use. This laptop gets the job done at a lower cost. I play CyberPunk, The Witcher, Forza Horizon, Dying Light, Battlefield series at high settings and no problems.

"I buy this laptop for work and play games on a Samsung g9 monitor, by replacing my old, hot, and broken Lenovo Y740. This is the laptop with RTX 3080 (laptop) with 16gb gddr ram at 130W power for a reasonable price. But there are many problems with the driver and hardware. The laptop cant stable output 240Hz on the ufo-test, window interface shows lag, which also affects gaming preferments, fps show normal but are lag and unstable motion in gaming. I also occur serval times reboot when gaming on a high graphic setting. The 15p-yd laptop bios interface is almost totally locked, you can only change a few things. The sleep mode also has problems, you can only wake the computer up by pressing the power button on the laptop (open the lid every time to do so), or set the laptop to WOL (wake from wifi with android WOL app). And the laptop automatically wakes at night when the laptop and I sleeping. Dp1.4 keeps disconnecting to the external monitor after reboot, this may happen if you got your NE driver updated. Servals windows system restore is needed to make the external monitor work out normally. A dp1.4 switcher is needed to make the system work normally if the external monitor screen doesn't show up at some games or system changes or reboots. Reboot Restores Rx Pro is a must if you want to keep your laptop runs stable in windows10 at 240hz. Upgrade to Win11 will just make things worst. Also using a Wifi remote power switch to force the laptop on battery mode to automatically put the laptop sleep in a setting of 3 mins, this can also force sleep back the laptop if its wake from sleep at night. The fan is very loud when Turbo mods are on, but it keeps the system at a very low temperature when gaming, which is outstanding compared to any other 3080 laptops from the market. Geekbench 5 Score for my unit is much lower than others on the internet, don't know if I tested it wrong or I just got a bad unit. After wasting a month's time tuning, the laptop is now all working and very useful. That sticker on the laptop is a joke. As there are no Thunderbolt 4 on the device, really don't know why they stick a sticker like this on it. Since I do not own any HDMI 2.1 monitor, I can't check the HDMI 2.1 port is real or not. Do not recommend buying this laptop if you want to use it gaming on an external monitor. Do not recommend buying this laptop if you want a stable gaming laptop focused on gaming. It even failed the ufo test on its own 240hz monitor too (show only 60hz, and it's not a driver problem that can be easily solved). Also have to mention the stupid UI of Gigabyte Control Center is like 16 years ago. It keeps blocking the visions of your desktop and even during gaming when changing volume/switching Control modes (by itself or manual). Overall this is an unstable gaming laptop you will want to return to amazon if you have it. Unless you have so much time and patience to solve all the problems it comes with. It took me a month to finally solve all problems it has. Including struggle to return it to Amazon or not. Gaming is now finally like a 3080 laptop expected to be. Great job gigabyte. Will never buy a gigabyte laptop again. Recommend to pay a little more to buy another brand. ( Do not recommend Lenovo and Gigabyte)",0
"Bought these so my wife and I could controller game at a console friends house, work great for that, but for typing or anything battery related strongly recommend something else. No touch screen no 4k screen (great for gaming with these specs but something to note). Good specs and performance but like I said, the keyboard is absolutely terrible on both of them.",0
We used this as a work computer for an associate located remotely. She started having issues with it overheating on her desk. Unfortunately this happened just past the return deadline in September. It lasted about 5 weeks.,0
Best bang for the buck!,0
I've tried to talk with Razer rep but they just seem to be buying time for my 30day replacement period to end,0
"This thing is a beast of a laptop. I honestly play all the latest games with no issues and at 144hz. I'd recommend upgrading your memory and solid state space later. 16 gigs is a bit outdated for any gaming computer in today's world. It sucks power like crazy so I have to keep it plugged in a lot, unless you turn it to power saving mode. For anyone looking to use 3d applications or video editing, I'd highly recommend this laptop for the price.",0
This product has quality for the money.,0
"Good computer perfect for school. The only thing that sucks is it doesn’t run google play store, but the new model does for only $40 more.",0
to live these product (computer)of $600.00 at the stares when is raining not if even to knock at the door is a shame,0
Good little lap top for basic needs,0
Easy to upgrade. Added another TB of NVME m.2 and 32gb of ram to the base model and it was much cheaper and probably better components. Runs 1080 low to mid in 144 frames in just about everything,0
"What a difference between my old Toshiba laptop and the chromebook! So fast! There are times it seems to freeze up, but it's so much better than what I've had! It could be my learning curve but I'm not sure I can process my android phone information with it and Firefox continues to take over Chrome, even though I've closed it.. and it's not showing up as a search engine under systems!",0
"Too slow to do anything, not worth the money",0
"144hz is nice but in Path of Exile I don't get near that, more like 40-70 fps on med low settings. Classic WoW on med high I don't get near it either, usually 70s. Overall laptop performance is 'passable' for playing most games I've tried so far. It does seem to chug and drop frames here and there but overall ok. Keyboard sucks. Trackpad is really frustrating to use to. I like my old ibm thinkpad track pad a lot more. This one seems to double click a ton and stick. Built in mic is generally not very good. It will work but you really need something else. Webcam is the same grainy webcam you would expect, if it works.My major issue is that this comes with a 3.5 combo jack. If I plug my headphones in they do not work. If I plug them in and restart the pc they work great until you unplug them then you need to restart again. If I try and use a splitter and use a mic + headphones it won't work. Attempted to use headphones + built in mic and also doesn't work. Webcam+ headphones doesn't work either. Asus slow and and clunky support took 30 mins of chat time before I was told to reinstall stuff again. He gave me the support number and after being put on hold several times I was told it needed to be RMA'd. Sadly I'm in Alaska right now and it would be nearly 2 months just in shipping time. I'm basically stuck for the next few months till I go home before I can do anything with it.Will be avoiding asus in the future. Generally had ok products from them but if support is this bad / slow it isn't worth risking it when something goes wrong",0
"I am blown away by the quality for the price of the laptop.Easiest computer I have ever set up. It leads you through the process and practically does it for you. With voice recognition, I think I typed in two passwords and then I was done.It used to take weeks, now it took less than an hour to set up. I was impressed.So far, it is quick and has handled everything I have thrown at it.It seems to run cool. I can put my hand under it and it is cool to the touch. Again, I am impressed.There is enough room on the platform to use a gaming cordless mouse without needing a mousepad on the side. That allows you to work and play on this computer just about anywhere.At this writing, I am very happy with it.",0
"You have to undervolt the CPU just to keep it from baking at 90c under load, if you don't I doubt this laptop will notlast very long.Even with that and a laptop cooler it still sits at a solid 75-80cNot only is this bad for your hardware, the keyboard gets very hot to the touchHad some issues with the power button not always working now it refuses to turn on at allInoperable after just 2 months of light useSave your money and time and get a higher budget quality laptop, the 1650 makes this laptop very desirable for the budget but everything about the construction and overall quality makes it feel like a cheap no name knock off productI would never recommend this product to anyone unless it was hundreds of dollars cheaper, was a complete waste of my money and I can't even use it as a paperweight due it it's cheap all plastic construction and dismally small battery",0
Nice chrome book!,0
"Laptop was packaged very nice, little bloatware, few updates to do right off the bat. Some Amazonians received a ""Chinese only"" Windows version, I did not.Out of the package the laptop looks great. Not super flashy, overall its aesthetically pleasing. When you open the lid you are met with a well designed Steelseries Keyboard. The laptop has a large palm rest area, almost too big imo, they could have spaced out the keyboard a bit better. I dont use laptop touchpads, but this one is one I would consider keeping my mouse unplugged for while web surfing and youtubing.Performance for the price is tough to beat. Beefy i7, little skimpy on the RAM only 8GB DDR4, easily upgradeable. Has the nVidia GTX 1050Ti 4GB GDDR5, the screen looks great no bleeding or anything, most laptops in this price range have just the 1050 or even lower specd GPUs. Also has 2 drives, a 128GB m.2 SSD which houses the Windows 10 OS, very speedy, I would buy a larger 2.5"" SSD to replace the slow 1TB.I havent pushed this laptop yet, and I dont really plan on it, I have seen other users on youtube get the CPU up to 91C, so it may get too hot for your lap.Battery life is going to be atrocious, and I fully accept that, I plan to stay plugged.I am very pleased with my purchase of this laptop, for the price and specs, I dont think you can pass on it.",0
"Essentially a piece of crap, that worked very slowly to start, and now barely functions. Am sending back for “warranty” service at my expense.",0
Packaging was secure and the laptop was new and in mint condition. Performance thus far is excellent. No complaints,0
"At 72 , my old laptop broke, and this one filled the gap perfectly! It's lightweight, backlit, and works well for online shopping, bill paying, and learning! The only glitch for me was how low volume the speakers were, but the Audio Wizard fixed that - wish I could say exactly how it worked, but for me it was just hit or miss until I got the sound level where I wanted it! All in all, a great, inexpensive computer for seniors like me!",0
Bought this for my husband. He likes the size and screen quality for what he uses it for Family History Work. He does not really watch movies or stream so we cannot comment on that aspect. We just got it so no comment on the battery life.,0
"so far I'm loving the laptop, I ended up adding another ssd to it,Not a fan of the where the ports are located, it would of been nice of the power port was in the backFYI, you can use the MSI software to switch the FN and windows key. I prefer having the windows key on my left,and the FN key on my right. Performance wise, pretty good, I had no issues running games on high/ultra, games like COD, battlefield 5, Halo the master cheif collection. My desktop build is 17-4790k with a GTX 970 ftw+ and this laptop holds up and performs better then my desktopPros:144hz screen10th Generation i7Full RTX2070Cons:power supply is big and heavy, Expected but still big and heavyScreen size, I know it's a 15.6 and it looks good, However I kinda wish it was 16-inch or something,(I understand 16-inch screens are rare, but 17 would have been too big for me, and 15.6 feels a little to small, idk Maybe I'm just weird",0
"Charged this full before starting it up. From setting up windows and getting office installed it took 33 minutes and the battery went to 52%.I say screw this and send it back after talking to customer service. Being told it would be handled like a regular return.Returned on 9/01, tracking says Amazon received 9/08. Up through 9/18 ""Customer Service"" keeps copy and pasting ill get my FOUR FIGURE REFUND ""Once they receive it"". I point out the prior points and they say ""weeeellllllll... in some circumstances it may take longer email us if you haven't received a refund by OCTOBER SECOND!"" Thats right, 33 day refund in spite of what customer service said on day 1!Believe the battery life bad reviews on ASUS and question if you want to deal with refunds through the mail or at a brick and mortar. Especially if you buy Microsoft Office on 8/25 like I did!",0

"My aunt bought the same laptop and it worked perfectly for her, so she recommended it to me as well. So, I went and bought it, sadly it came in the day after my graduation. I was very much look forward to using it for class work instead of my old slow computer I’ve had for years. Once this laptop came in I was very excited to try it out that night, so I went through the set up process, with my aunt’s help of course, seeing as how she already set up hers. Once finished the set up process, I wanted to just play on my brand new laptop. So, I got onto candy crush with it, because the game was already on it, and I downloaded Spotify. It worked perfect for the 30 minutes I was on, but it was late and I was tired, so I went to sleep. The next morning I wake up early and go to get on the laptop. I go and type in my password, and it goes to log me in, then I go to use it to look up a few things, and set up a few things on it. The web browser doesn’t show up, so I click it again, wait a minute, click again, and then waited. Almost half an hour passed until it popped up, but by then I had already clicked whatever else was on the screen, just hoping it would work. After this I shut it down, and I must have tried it 30 more times until finally getting tired of it freezing and so many different times.",0
"I didn't actually realize I had bought a tablet PC aka notebook PC. Nor did I realize it was touchscreen as well. Over all it does great with the games I play such as League of Legends, Habbo, Sims 4 and such. What I didn't like however was the touchscreen (that's a personal preference!) Nor did I like that it was a ""tablet PC"" (also personal preference). Lastly, I didn't appreciate the Windows S mode. I opted to disable it. Google it, because this could be a deal breaker to some! Other than that, this little guy packs a powerful punch when it comes to speed and graphics!",0
Product failed. Hardware not working. Needed it to be ready to start grad school for my daughter this week. Would not recommend. Very disappointed. Now I have to return and buy another laptop for her first week of school.,0
"Que puedo decir de esta laptop. Es súper rápida. El procesador funciona de maravilla, tanto para tareas básicas de ofimática, hasta como para hacer edición de video.He usado las versiones de Intel pero esta versión es mejor en rendimiento por sus 6 núcleos. Los 144hz se ven impresionantes, los cuales si llegan a percibirse en algunos juegos. No cuenta con la mejor gráfica del mercado, pero con una 1650ti puedes hacer grandes cosas.Todo en la computadora es perfecto, solamente la batería si se queda muy corta ya que incluso al dejarlo cargar durante mas de 6 horas en su primera carga, no noté una mejoría en cuanto a la autonomía. La vida de la batería dura cuando mucho 3 horas/2 horas y 30 minutos aproximadamente usándola en modo silencioso, con el brillo a lo más mínimo, y con el teclado RGB apagado.Para sacarle el mayor provecho a este tipo de equipos, es mejor tenerlas siempre conectadas al tomacorriente.En General es un buen producto, la mejor compra que he hecho en Amazon MX",0

"I bought my Razerblade directly from the company last November (2017) and was excited to finally have a premium laptop. I'm a developer by trade and this is my primary work computer. Not long after I got it, I started getting random blue screens. I contacted Razer and they had me do a factory reset. This didn't change anything and I still had BSOD issues.They had me send my laptop in for repair and after a little more than a week I got a new laptop in the mail. This one had the same issues. Went through the process again and ended up with a third laptop. This one finally seemed to work.... for about 4 months. Then it just up and died. Sent that one in and they replaced the motherboard and sent it back to me. I'm not sure if they are just recycling components but this one has all of the same BSOD issues the previous ones did.Would not buy this laptop.",0
Great laptop for the price and it's easy to use. Might want to invest in a bluetooth mouse for gaming and other things.,0
M1 chip is faster than core i5. I see there is quite a big difference in machine handling concurrent applications at a time. Really nice improvement by Apple.,0

"Tl;dr: The MSI GL65 is a great gaming laptop for the price and well worth your money.Overall: The GL65 is a great machine for semi-portable gaming. The battery will last a while for normal tasks but don’t expect it to last more than an hour (most likely less than 40 minutes) while playing games requiring the graphics card.Pros: The list is too long of the pros for this laptop, but the primaries are the RTX2070, 10th gen Intel i7, and NVMe SSD. This combination provides for running most games currently available at maximum settings and still get a respectable 50-60 FPS.Cons: Crapware. This is actually the only reason I removed a star from the rating. I would gladly pay extra, and have, to not be forced to remove lots of, what I consider to be, useless software. By far the worst offender on the list of crapware preinstalled is Norton. This software has absolutely no place on a gaming laptop because it uses far more resources than it should for the benefit it provides. As a professional IT person, I recommend and use Eset for computer security.",0

"Arrived sooner than promised. Shows no signs of wear. I bought it for my daughter and she says it's better than her previous laptop, which I had purchased new. Buying this refurbished laptop allowed me to get more memory, more RAM and faster processing for less money.I would not hesitate to purchase another refurbished unit from this seller.",0
Perfection !!!!!,0
"You can't get anything better for this price range. This laptop will run anything you throw at it in highest setting at 1080p. In 4k, you'll have to run it at medium setting (Xbox/PS4 visuals) to get a decent performance. This thing is super fast. The RGB keyboard is great. The keys feel good and a number pad is included!Hardware upgrades are easy to perform. The first thing I did was open the bottom to install a Samsung 860 EVO SSD. Very straight forward without incident.I do have a few cons:- The power supply plugs in the middle of the right side of the laptop... This can pose a problem if you're right-handed and using a mouse.- Smudges! I feel that by just staring at the laptop, you will get a smudge. It's a smudge magnet.- No Thunderbolt 3. It does have one USB C port but it's for data transfers and peripherals. Can't connect to a monitor.- Extreme gaming mode setting makes the fans very loud.- The battery is pretty bad. It lasts about three hours on normal tasks and about 1.5 hours in gaming.My cons are me nitpicking. At this price range, they're all acceptable. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone. It's a high-end performing laptop at a budget price.",0
Quite a bit of bloatware included,0
Nice laptop,0
"I like the shape, the weight,I dislike the material it is made of , and limited applications to install on it",0
"Great computer; really enjoying it but I have one big issue- they claim you get 19.5 hours out of a charge. I don't know how you could get anywhere close to that with normal use. When I turn mine on and it's fully charged I get about ten hours, maybe eleven if I use it lightly- nowhere close to 19.5. That's hugely misleading, but otherwise it's a fantastic machine.",0
Love this laptop,0

"Purchased this unit because of dissatisfaction with Lenovo Flex 11 which was purchased first. I will post a separate review for the Lenovo Flex. Unfortunately the main positives of this Samsung unit compared to the Lenovo Flex is its 64GB eMMC hard drive (the Flex only has 32GB capacity) and the micro SDHC card slot works (I have a 128GB card inserted which does not stick out but is flush against the side of this unit) whereas I could not successfully insert any SD card into the card reader of the Flex. Also, for the Flex it appeared that any SD card inserted would still have one third to half of the card sticking out which would make it less than ideal as a permanent way to expand it onboard 32GB eMMC memory. The screen on this unit is passable but not as sharp or vivid as the screen on the Flex. The onboard speakers is extremely disappointing. With volume set to 50%, the sound from the Flex is robust and sufficiently loud to watch videos or listen to music without resorting to earphones. However on this Samsung unit, when volume is set at 50%, the sound is faint(er) and less clear. In order to achieve the same audio experience of the Flex, I had to increase the volume to over 80% if I wanted to listen to sounds coming from the speakers. Can’t speak to whether the same problem exists when using earphones as I have not plugged in and used earphones on either units. Overall I am disappointed with the performance of this unit even though it technically “works” and does everything one would expect from a Chromebook. Only reason why I even bothered to buy this unit (and the Lenovo Flex 11 from a different online retailer, the one which ends in egg) is because my Toshiba Chromebook is getting old (but actually performs better than either of these two newer units) and my Google Chromebook Pixel (2013 model) is no longer able to receive the newest Chrome OS updates but also still performs better than either of these two units. Ending on a positive note, the Google Play Store works fine for both this Samsung unit and the Lenovo Flex. Had no problem installing my go-to Android apps onto either unit (e-readers, Chinese dictionary, video players with more features than what Chromebooks can normally do/play). On side note, did have to purchase a cover (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GNE4QMO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) because this Samsung unit felt too flimsy to carry around in my backpack without something to protect it from scratches and nicks. The iPearl mCover hard shell case fits well (even if I do think it’s somewhat pricey for what it is).",0
Amazing laptop for the price! Nice keyboard as well. Very happy,0
Wonderful,0
I have purchased multiple laptops and this has to be my favorite one so far.,0
The laptop does get a little hot,0
Awesome! Replacement for an old workhorse!,0
"My priorities in searching for a laptop were as follows: good brand, low emission (meaning low heat and low noise), MATTE display (because the common glossy displays reflect way too much light), HD monitor, >8GB RAM and a Solid State Drive. I spent a lot of time reviewing newegg, bestbuy and amazon for top sellers, along with pcreviews and notebookcheck dot net (which does incredible detailed reviews showing how much heat and noise a laptop generates). I settled on this notebook and am very happy with what I got. The 2018 version is definitely worth the extra $50 over the 2017 version because the bezel (plastic border around the screen) is much smaller resulting in a laptop that is 10% smaller than the 2017 version while maintaining a 13"" screen! The faint high pitched noise put out by the motherboard is only detectable in a silent room when you place your head within 12"" of the keyboard. The battery life is stellar. Under load, the system hardly generates any heat and under light use (browsing/Word), I never hear the fan kick in. This 8th generation i5 is much more powerful than older i7 CPU's. It's incredibly thin. I was worried about the laptop looking 'gold' but it doesn't - it looks very silver with a faint hue. Very fast start-ups - I press the power button from hibernation and by the time I moved my finger to the fingerprint, I'm up and running within 2 seconds. Fully recommend.",0
I just got it today and I love it! It was easy to set up. It's lightweight. It looks nice. And it was a very good price.,0
Great laptop! Nice and easy to work!,0
"This was a good buy. If I need another computer, I would get this one again",0
"I'm happy with the MSI GL75 Leopard laptop that I purchased on Amazon. It arrived intact and within the expected delivery specified. I haven't done any gaming on it yet so I can't give any feedback on its suitability. It has been fairly easy to set up. Most of the problem that I encountered with the setup were licensing issues with my software apps (as opposed to problems caused by the laptop). The only thing I'm not completely happy with is the keyboard. It often fails to leave a space between words (even though I pressed the space bar). I have to go back and insert the space. I'm also noticing more typing errors in general. Finally, the font used for the key caps is a bit unusual. Comparing it to the keyboard on my old Alienware 17-R3, this new one is not as good. Of course, the fact that Alienware keyboard was full sized without the chicklet style gaps between the keys probably influences my opinion. Folks who are used to the chicklet style keys may feel right at home with this one. I didn't feel that the keyboard issues warranted rating it down to a four so I gave it a five. BTW, it was more of a struggle than usual to get the case off to replace the SSD with a Samsung 980 Pro 2TB.A couple of weeks of usage has made me knock off a star. The keyboard continues to be irritating and the USB-C port must have some sort of issue. The Apple iPhone charger and the cable for the Samsung T7 external SSD both seem to have intermittent issues. The SSD will disconnect and then re-connect and the iPhone MagSafe charger sometimes doesn't charge at all. Both work normally using different connectors (e.g., USB-A, iPhone power cube, etc.). USB-C cables can also be difficult to connect. Never had this sort of trouble with USB-C port on my old Alienware laptop.",0
"Easy to manage with Windows 10. The SSD puts normal SATA drives to shame. System is so quick it won't even accept a ReadyBoost cache to boost system performance. Overall a simple, easy to use, dependable, and perfect for peeps looking for something small and light.",0

"The Dell XPS 13 9310 Thin and Light Touchscreen Laptop is a great option if you're looking for a fast, lightweight tablet/laptop combo that's perfect for taking while on the go. A touchscreen laptop is something I honestly thought was overrated until I tried it - having the work functionality of a laptop with the ease of navigation of a tablet, I found myself loving being able to type of my work then quickly tapping buttons and parts of the page on the screen without having to fuss with a mouse. The laptop has an excellent display, a fast processor, and boots up/shuts down amazingly quickly so I can wrap things up and easily take it on the go. It's so lightweight that I feel like I'm carrying a tablet, albeit one that comes with a keyboard built-in and closes like a flip phone to protect both the screen and the keyboard. It only has a few things about it I don't love, but for the most part, I would still purchase this laptop again simply because it gets our family's tasks done and done well.The display is excellent and images come back very detailed while the touch screen works without any flaws. The picture quality is pretty amazing - it comes through very clearly with clearly defined details and I was able to watch Ytube videos in 1440p60 as well as 4K HD without any lag. As for the touch screen capabilities, it works as well as any other touchscreen device I've used. It's very responsive and many of the finger motions such as pinching open to zoom in/pinching in to zoom out are the same as most tablets and phones. One thing to note is that the screen does not rotate when the laptop is turned on its side nor can you fold the keyboard behind the screen - if you want that capability, there is a 2-in-1 version where you can do just that. As for using a stylus/pen, this laptop does not support the Dell Active Pen, but you can use normal passive pens for more precise taps on the screen. I personally found using my fingers was suitable enough, but like most tablets, I also found myself having to clean the screen more frequently than on my normal laptop.The camera on the Dell XPS 13 9310 is absolute garbage. At not even a megapixel, everything recorded or photos taken with this laptop will look like photos taken on digital cameras from the 90s (and I would know, I owned a crappy digital camera in the 90s!). While it works well enough for a last-ditch work meeting under the proper very bright lighting, as any light dimmer than a spotlight on you will make you look as grainy as a face buried in the sand, you're probably better off using your cell phone for any important virtual calls.Similarly, the speakers on the Dell XPS are only average at best, although I didn't test them very much since I like to use headphones with my mobile devices. With that in mind, headphones connect very well via Bluetooth, and if you want to use wired headphones, there is a headphone jack on this laptop. Speaking of inputs, there are relatively few connection points for peripherals – just two USB-C ports (one of that you will need at some point to charge the laptop), a microSD card reader, and a headphone jack. If you need to connect any other device via wired connection, you will need to get a USB-C Multiport Adapter. Luckily there are many available on Amazon and they work great with this computer.The software on this computer works as well as any other Windows-based computer. There's the inevitable push to pay for McAfee Security and some general bloatware in there, but everything you don't want can be easily uninstalled and nothing really slows the computer down. The battery life on the Dell XPS is fairly good and I've been able to run it for several hours without needing to stop and charge it. Battery life does vary depending on many factors including how bright you turn your display on, what programs you're running, and if you're running peripherals on it (just for starters!), so your mileage will vary. I've found I had no problem running this computer for 6 hours before I plugged it in - it still had some charge left when I did so, and I've never tried to run it into the ground. Finally, one last thing to note is that the computer does run fairly hot. I'm not sure if this will be an issue in the long run, but this laptop runs hot enough where I don't want it sitting on my lap while working unless I'm in a cold doctor's office or a ski lodge near the door. So far it hasn't caused any adverse issues with my computer, it's still concerning and an inconvenience to put the laptop on a table or on a book while using on my lap.Overall, the Dell XPS 13 9310 is a great quality computer that is very lightweight and great for travel. I like how portable it is, how quickly it runs, and the picture quality on the display. It's convenient to be able to use the screen like a tablet but have all the functionality of a standard laptop. While it's not perfect, it's still a good quality laptop that's worth considering.",0
"good lapto, I've been using it for 3 months and it works perfectly, except for the keyboard that hurt me.Where can I get this keyboard?Thank you:",0
The AMD graphics card and processor surprised me with great performance / speed,0
Bough this for my mom. Battery life is great & it’s so sleek that we can take it anywhere without it taking up space. also the price for this is great I couldn’t find a better deal anywhere else.,0
"Faster, nicer looking.",0
a bit heavy for an all-around laptop.,0
Becauful about refurbushi stuff I had to send this back for refund failed power on,0
"Good quality laptop, fast startup",0
The screen was foggy and you couldn’t see clear on it from different perspectives. But I would’ve kept it if it had windows 10 though.,0
This was a real bargain at under $600 it has everything a gamer needs don't know if it will be available at this price again.,0
"My job is Senior Business Intelligence Developer and Analyst, and I'm working remotely. To say this laptop is good for students but not for business use is just false. I'm able to do absolutely everything without lag and without issues. In my spare time, I also do music using Soundtrap. I plug a USB keyboard and microphone/guitar interface into this laptop and I'm able to create multi-track songs. My caps lock does have an indicator light that works, and I have zero complaints or issues. Maybe some people are reviewing an earlier model? I purchased mine in February of 2022, and the OS is Windows 11 Home. Actually, I bought 2; One for me and one for a family member who does graphics with Gimp. The laptops are great and we have no complaints.",0
Some units have more backlight bleed,0
"I love the touchscreen. The older I get the worse my eyes are. I can easily enlarge the screen to read emails, articles, etc. It was super easy to set up when I took it out of the box. For what I do on the computer this is the perfect one for me.",0
Shortly after a year of purchase.. my son was playing and completely went dead and unable to charge… shortly after troubleshooting found out the motherboard went bad on it now it’s useless unless a new board is installed which is near the price of a new complete unit. Very disappointed!!!,0
okay I will start with the good about Apple.. my daughters last laptop lasted 10 years(2 batteries and the pad cracked).. started failing.. we bought her this new 2022 Macbook Air laptop M2.. it weighs very little like a heavy cell phone.. also doesn't heat up as much.. so far has worked just like her last one so far pretty good.. the new operating system software made it impossible to move her Office products over so she put in LibreOffice which is free and it mimics Office pretty well.. it uses USB 4 Thunderbolt ports and you have to buy adapters to use USB drives etc.. they're pretty cheap so not a big problem.. there's a new 1 TB flash drive for a good price(30$) on Amazon right now.. adds storage and backup.. has dual USB 3 and 4 which will work on this laptop.. USB 4 is Thunderbolt.. if you like Apple and need new laptop for 1200 bucks you should get this one..,0
"REVISED REVIEW after continued use. If you get this machine, definitely invest in a multi-yeared service. It's been less than a year and machine now disconnects randomly, overheats and is rather unreliable for regular (not gaming) use! BUYER BEWAREThe speed, extra features - like the cooling fan, multi-colored light-up keys, etc. made this a very, very well received gift for my young gamer. It is sturdy, well-constructed and reliable piece of technology. Two thumbs up",0
Battery life is decent for the specs.,0
"Got this one to replace my 2013 Acer model. I never had any issues with my 2013 Acer..just not Google Chrome software supported anymore. Still works great... I just don’t want it connected to WiFi with updates no longer available. Sooo purchased new Acer and It is great!!!!! Wonderful sound, keyboard touch is great, screen great, download speed is amazing!!!! It’s just GREAT!!!! I am so impressed with the price....and thankful that it’s affordable. Easy setup... I took it out of the box, plugged it up, turned it on, connected to WiFi and then logged onto my google account.... and bam.. perfection!!!! So thank you Acer and Google.",0
"Me gustó el diseño, no me gustó y me hizó arrepentir de la compra la capacidad de disco duro del portátil, lo siento muy poco funcional, si pudiera devolverlo lo haría.",0
Little heavy might get smaller lighter next tome,0
Awesome laptop,0
I have bought this laptop for my business associate. As he was traveling he didn't have a chance to set it up. we were trying to do now but neither wifi nor bluetooth are responding. Amazon told me 30 days passed and dismissed me. Truly bad experience.,0
"When I bought this, I expect GSync would be supported, but it's not. This is a stunning omission for a laptop that has a 240 Hz screen and a 3070. I don't get it. Why leave out a very important gaming feature?Laptop has been returned. No G-Sync is a deal breaker for me.",0
"I use this for work: Zoom meetings, Google Drive, and other simple applications. I've dropped it a couple times and haven't had to get it fixed, it fired right up. No one was more surprised than me because it will seem fairly flimsy in-hand. I wish the power plug was more sturdy. The actual connector fits tight but is easy to break as it stick far out. It's very easy to operate and has been a great go-to laptop away from my MacBook. Great battery life, it does not have a touch screen (thankfully), and cuts on/off quickly.",0
"I bought the laptop for my personal and work use. For the price i paid, i was expected a CD or two to download softwares like Microsoft..etc. I was disappointed that I had to purchase the software that cost me as much as my laptop???",0
"The laptop is a standard laptop, no extras which is what I needed. Two weeks into owning the laptop, the WiFi completely disappeared off it and all the computer was detecting was a LAN. I factory reset the computer and all was fine for two more weeks, when I woke up and did it again. Had to send back the computer for a full refund, luckily I was still in the window for returning it.",0
The best laptop I ever had!I'm a web developer and It fulfills all my expectations. I only had an issue with the SSD but Dell support replaced the SSD and it's working great!,0
"Less than two months after delivery, screen is permanently dimmed to dark/dead. (Did not drop/get wet/damage) Google revealed this is a common issue that HP is aware of, and all “fixes” included either removing the battery (which this model does not allow), or resetting (which you can’t do without being able to see the screen). Other fixes did not work. I had to send the item off to (hopefully) be repaired, but this comes in the middle of my busiest paper-writing time, which is what I purchased this for. 😒",0
"I paid over $1800 for a brand new Lenovo X1 Carbon. These machines are made in China and you do not know what you are getting. I also bought an on site warranty. The computer does not stay connected to the internet. I called Lenovo and a tech person got on my computer and did some things to it and told me that it was now fixed. It was not! I called again and they sent someone out who said they were going to replace the wireless card. They took the machine apart, replaced the wireless card and then told me they had sent the wrong part for the antenna so they had to come back to replace the antenna. This has taken up hours of my time. They replaced the antenna and told me now it was fixed. Right after the guy left the computer disconnected from the internet. I called him and he told me he had closed the case and I had to call Lenovo again. I called Lenovo again and spoke to someone with such a thick accent I could not understand what he was saying. He put me on hold and when he finally came back he told me he was going to check with his supervisor to see what he could do but it took about 10 minutes for me to finally understand what he was saying because his accent was so thick that it was too difficult to understand what he was saying and I am good at languages. I still do not have a solution to this problem so all I can say is do not buy this computer unless you want to throw money and time down the drain.",0
Nice.,0
"It gets real hot real fast, not recommended",0
"Have been using for a month, and this thing is such a beast. That being said, the armoury crate button sometimes doesnt work when unplugged due to unknown reason and that is quite annoying even though i am not using it very oftenAnyway im enjoying the laptop",0
"Me equivoque al evaluar al vendedor, lo confundi con otro articulo que compre. Este vendedor es excelente y muy recomendable",0
"Q, A, and Z keys on keyboard didn’t work. Returned for a full refund.",0
"For gaming, it works very well and the screen quality looks almost as if it's an OLED display with how vibrant it looks. As with the summary, a 3070 is driving the graphics and puts out a steady frame rate above what most games I play need as well as being able to handle them without issue. The underlying problem is that it makes the power brick heat up if the brick isn't placed on a surface that isn't carpet and can cause it to shut off.",0
"I never bothered to boot into Windows, instead I installed Linux (Fedora 28 Xfce spin) right away. Desktop performance is surprisingly good, and even large apps like web browsers perform acceptably well. The laptop's screen is decent, though off-axis view angles are not so great. The keyboard and trackpad are pretty good, but the trackpad requires too much force to push down and click.The build quality is not quite what it should be, but I guess that's a $150 laptop for you. Overall this is a good little laptop for the price -- with Linux it runs nice and smooth and trouble free.",0
it come with defective screen and a dead pixel and light bleed,0
Did not come with a 1920x1080 screen!!!!! And came with the wrong laptop charger.The resolution was the WHOLE reason i bought it!,0
The Acer nitro 5 is an amazing laptop for gaming and game creation. I’ve had the laptop for two week now and I use it every day for designing and creating my games and graphics designs on photoshop. The battery is around 7-8 hours unless u are us muti tab and you may want to increase your ram but otherwise it works perfectly. I would recommend this laptop to any new and inspiring graphic design artist our game creators as an entry laptop.,0
Just as described. This was easy to set up & use. It is fast and graphics are good too.This even arrived early.,0
Prueben exhaustivamente el producto los primeros días y meses porque yo lo usé 4 veces y de la nada no volvió a encender pero como desde que me llegó ya pasaron 3 meses no lo puedo devolver perdí mucho dinero me siento estafado,0
"While the laptop SHOULD be a banger, Acer's refusal to back it's products with a decent warranty means risk is on the consumer to actually get what you ordered. They only fix the monitor if there are 5 dead pixels, 4? Out of luck. People shouldn't have to spend $1300 so they can hope there aren't ANY dead pixels. Fool me once...Update: today my friend was about to spend $2600 on a 3080ti Predator laptop but when I told him about the pixel policy he bought something else. Hope it was worth it, Acer!",0
"La computadora es muy rápida. La uso para dar clase en línea con OBS y producción musical. La probé con el simulador Beam NG y aunque los gráficos no son los mejores no se traba el juego. Si es cierto que el teclado no es el de mejor calidad pero tampoco es tan malo. La pila le dura aproximadamente 5 a 6 horas en trabajo de oficina.El teclado viene en inglés, pero después de unos días te acostumbras y recuerdas en que tecla está cada caracter.Conclusión: por el precio creo que está muy buena y su procesador es muy rápido",0
"Recieved them today. Should have been delivered last week but UPS SUX. Turned on, answered the questions and set up was done. Took just a few minutes.",0
"I waited a few months to review. Use this for streaming, nice big screen, and poking around on line.The big keyboard isnt comfortable for me and the keys aren't back lighted but not a deal breaker for me. If you are a student or someone doing a lot of typing or at night, just something to consider.Excellent value and price. Would buy again.",0
"I might not be much of a gamer, but this is good for practical necessities. Otherwise, the games run much smoothly and I look forward to see progress I can make with this as a content creator, and comedian.",0
This laptop is completely trash it keeps freezing and wont let me put my pictures on it,0
"The computer is fast, clean and good looking",0
"the battery port is on left side of the computer, which keeps being slightly inconvenient",0
"Fue la compra perfecta, llego en excelente condición y con la capacidad indicada en la compra. Amo el teclado, es super ligero y agradable a la vista.",0
"My worst computer choice since I started buying computers. There's been a never-ending series of problems, but here's a big one that forced me to buy another laptop. Power comes in through the USB-C ports (more on the ""C"" USB's later). The computer needed to be powered up, but the USB-C ports weren't working. I tried a half-dozen on-line solutions first, like reinstalling the USB drivers, etc. I believe a windows update disabled them, (and not just the USB 3.0's), because the problem happened after an update. (You can Google this problem...it's for real.) Either way, with no power left, I couldn't roll back the update, or keep problem solving. So no power, and no way to charge it.If I hadn't been fixing problem after problem with this laptop, I could research more and try to solve this new problem, but I've had enough. Consider: the camera is at the bottom of the screen. So if you're on zoom, you can't type without filling up people's screens with your knuckles and fingers typing away. Everyone on the other end had complaints or jokes about this. Ridiculous.Other problems: the fan revved up suddenly (overheating) and the laptop shut down. It's so fast you can't hit ""save"" on your work. Whatever you're working on is lost, or you're disconnected from a zoom meeting. Yes, I updated the BIOS and all the rest, and it seemed to help for a while but never stopped reoccurring. I reinstalled windows. On and on. I won't list all the other glitches, but once the problems started, I never had 2 days in a row that I was able to use the laptop without reinstalling drivers, updating from Dell, and so on. I've owned 2 Dell desktops that were great. One is 7 years old and still running. This is my first dell laptop, and it's my last.Last detail: if you need a regular USB port, my model didn't have one. Say goodbye to all your thumb drives, printer cables, unless you like cluttering up your desk with a hub, and want to drag a hub around with you in case you're at another location and you need to hook up to their equipment. And another tip: many hubs you can buy on-line won't work because they need more power than the USB-C will give them. Good luck picking the right one on the first try. Also, I went through 3 hubs and windows never recognized one of them, but ""luckily"" it worked most to the time anyway.",0
Good computer for my son.,0
Bought the same model in local store this month.The updated CPU is a quad core compared with the previous dual-core i5. The boosted frequency is 3.4 GHz which is amazing!And the 12 GB ram is really really useful.Love it!,0
"Heating issues - this thing gets hot.. have to turn down games to low quality when it heats up. MSI has an OK'ish customer service. Battery life is lower than advertised about 3-4 hours. Not what they claim it to be. I mean sure you can extend if you don't do anything on it.Pros:It's excellent in terms of ability to run everything, powerhouse but lacks stamina. It is light.. super light - every laptop now feels heavy against this.",0
"I would leave 0 stars if I could. Had this laptop for five months, was very satisfied overall with it’s performance. Until today I hooked it up to my tv via hdmi to watch Netflix, I noticed the borders were cut off around the edges, no problem I can fix that. I went to ASUS website to download the current display drivers, to allow me to run the Intel Graphics Control System application. I installed the driver ASUS gave me on their site, still couldn’t load the control system. Used windows option to search web for latest drivers, window found drivers and installed them for me. Required a restart. When it restarted the screen was black and I haven’t been able to get it to work since. It doesn’t even make it to the windows login page, as evidenced by the lack of caps lock light going on/off. Tried hard resets, not working. Waste of money. Will change review if ASUS or amazon makes this right but I contacted them and they have been of no use. I was very satisfied but now I am very disappointed with my purchase and will not go back to this brand again.",0
I have only had this for a couple days but I love it. I went from a macbook to this and expected to be disappointed. I didn't have to adjust any of the settings or anything with this laptop. I logged into my gmail and everything was perfect. So far I have no complaints. I can't believe how inexpensive it was.,0
the power button is a little bit too easy to press,0
"We are not gaming much but were looking for a laptop that can be universal enough and can be used for casual gaming. We also looked for good expandability and easier migration from old laptop. This fit the bill nicely. We just moved the drive from old laptop into a spare slot, and whoalla you got all of your old files in your new laptop. We did add 8Gb stick to it, as we do use more than 8Gb of RAM frequently. It also has an extra slot for another NVMe SSD.",0
I use this product for everything. I love this product. It is a wonderful laptop.,0
a lack of USB ports on the side may become a problem when I'm at my desk at home,0
"I purchased this for light home use, mostly by my second grader for virtual schooling. So far, it also gets used to play some games from the Windows store and Sims 4. Overall, we have been happy. ASUS generally puts out a good product.However, I docked a star for two reasons:1) customer support is terrible. My laptop stopped charging after 2 months. Root cause - bad power adapter. Instead of sending me a new adapter to try, they had me send my laptop in. It was 3 months before I got my laptop back. It was a long and frustrating story, and though everyone I spoke to was very nice, the lack of communication on their part was appalling.2) the adapter that comes with it is incredibly fragile. After the initial debacle with the power supply, the new one they sent me when they returned my laptop stopped working within 3 months. Replacing the adapter with an after-market has worked fine so far.For the price, this has been a good laptop. Just do yourself a favor and get a spare adapter for when the original breaks.",0
"After a few months of use, the keyboard would freeze forcing a restart after which the same problem would occur over and over. I've had friends with similar issues with the Chromebook. Quality control may not be what it should be. Finally trashed it and bought an iPad and keyboard with which we are very happy.",0
Nice small laptop for doing small things not alot of ram or storage but it does do what it is ment to do at s good price,0
"But expect fatigue if you are trying to type reports, essays, articles, or a novel.",0
First one had severe screen distortion. Replacement has just a black screen. Would not but this product again. Spent $50 to FedEx the 2nd laptop to the person that needed it immediately and 2nd one didn't work either. Going to buy a Mac book,0
The larger touch pad is a nice addition and allows easier movement across the screen without having to lift your finger and start again.,0
"This is the best laptop I have ever owned, albeit I've only owned one before this, it was made to run windows. The internal hard drive makes everything better, and it looks chic to display.Update 7/28/2019:The laptop is still outperforming it's expectations. I love this thing, and the batter hasn't depleted too bad either even though I use it daily.",0
"Product came with a scratch on the screen, and once turned one, didn’t recognize the hard drive. Had to sent 3 emails to the address provided to get an answer, and I got an answer it was: you have to contact Amazon.",0
After 3 months the fans started making a rattling noise.,0
"I've had this laptop for a little over a year, and it rarely fails me. I've dropped it several times, and there's barely a scratch on it. As is expected for a Chromebook, you can really only do stuff on the web, but there are extensions. And for the decently low price, it's a good deal. My only complaint would be that the keys seem to get stiff and fall off somewhat easily, but I have had it for over a year.",0
"Admittedly the laptop is incredibly sleek. The display is phenomenal, the laptop is very lightweight, and the specs just speak for themselves.However, what is absolutely unacceptable about it is its fan noise. Most people have complained that the fan is really loud whenever the laptop is plugged into the charger, and while this is absolutely true, I've also noticed the fan runs really loudly even when the laptop is unplugged or sitting idle and it tends to get really hot. The obnoxious fan starts running even if all I'm doing is opening up a web browser and checking my email.For a brand new laptop of this price and technology, the fan noise and heating issues are unacceptable, especially considering how they're triggered at the most menial of computer tasks. My beat up 6 year old Lenovo laptop is significantly quieter and doesn't overheat. The only time it does is when I'm doing a substantial amount of work or gaming for too long with my computer which is how is completely understandable. The XPS 13 9370 has no such excuse.",0
"If you are a developer and enjoy Linux you wont have much left (1GB) to play with.I am no chrome OS or even Linux expert so do not know how to apt install on a SD card - anyone know ?Also GIT does not work due to file permissions on SD Cards due to Google's annoying lockdown of the /mnt/chromeos/removableIf you are not a developer its a great machine - super keyboard - great battery life - I am using it in Aus with a Aussie to US travel adapterWith 128 GB or more SD card with a good bit rate (V30 or better ) you can store loads of video, photos or downloadsThere is no comparison to windows - much more enjoyable on a less powerful processor and 4GB ram is fine ....",0
I have used this laptop for school for 8 months now and it still works well. Starts up fast with zero issues. This laptop is good for regular school use.,0
"Never got HD audio working with Linux, no sound from HDMI or display port",0
Laptop would crash in and out of games.,0
"This laptop would be absolutely 5 stars but has a few issues that likely boil down to wiring issues.1. Sometimes the screen flashes. No idea why. To temporarily fix it I usually shut the laptop and reopen. It's very frustrating.2. Sometimes the touchpad seems to get confused and randomly move. It's almost purchased things on Amazon before. I'd be wary of the touchpad. Usually yo fix that you can press the left Alt key. But again, seems like a wiring issue.3. After having the laptop for about a year, the fan now makes some noise when it's on. This is probably normal for laptops but wanted to put that in the review.All in all, I wouldn't trust asus laptops. My Dad's has a similar touchpad problem, while my old HP, Macbook, and Lenovo never had any touchpad problems like this.",0
I’ve never used a Chromebook before this one but I’m shocked at what a good device it is for my needs and at such a great price.Highly recommended.,0
so i ordered this Chromebook and when i got it the keyboard never worked. so i tried everything i could to try and fix it. and none of the normal stuff worked so i opened it up and look and there was tape holding it together on the inside i guess some tape came lose during shipping and the keyboard got unplugged.anyways. this is clear evidence that this computer was refurbished. and not new.and yes i know what i was doing i am a computer technician.,0
just what I Ordered for my Grand Son,0
Buena compra y buen producto,0
Compact but very fast and does everything a full size laptop does,0
Très contente de mon achat.,0
I had a very positive experience with technical support even though they weren't able to solve the problem remotely.,0
I love this. Works great and is fast for what I need it for.,0
Amazing laptop and fast delivery.,0
I'm still getting used to it but so for so good. I was surprised to see that the color of this unit is not the soft gold/champagne I see in the pictures but a warm silver. I was upset at first but I actually like it better. Update to follow.,0
"Beautiful, high functioning laptop but you cannot see the keys in many light conditions - the surface of the keyboard is gorgeous, however the keys are painted with a light gold color that disappears, making it very DIFFICULT TO SEE the keyboard. The computer was super light, fast and had a nice look/feel. Had to return it and get a EVO from another mfr. Bummer.",0
"This is a good computer for just surfing the web, however, it doesn't always keep the wifi identified in the house and we lose connection when we close the lid.",0
"El equipo es muy bueno , tiene características que son inigualables para el precio por el cual se vende, muy rápido y la pantalla es tal cual lo describe, ahora lo que me da inconformidad es la calidad del material, se que es un equipo de bajo costo en comparación a los otros equipos gamer de alta gama, pero el material de la carcasa, siento que es pobre, se ve como plástico de muy baja calidad, me hubiera gustado que fuera un material mas refinado, siendo un equipo de una marca de renombre como es ACER.",0
First it took over eight hours for the the laptop to update. Took another hour for the setup to complete. Once everything was said and done and I created my account I was able to use the laptop twice. On the third attempt the Laptop went through the Lenovo load screen to the password screen. Once at this screen the keyboard would not work the bar to type in the password would not show up to type in the password. I spent over an hour on the phone and then an additional 30 mins on chat help to try and resolve the issue. I was finally told there was nothing they could do for me as it appears to be a software issue.The laptop worked great for the first two rimes I was able to use it. The time frame for this issue to appear was one week after unboxing. I do not recommend this item.,0
I ordered mine on the 12th and received it on the 17th. I have not had a new laptop since I bought my MacBook Pro back in 2014. This laptop is actually thinner than I expected for all the cooling and specs it has. I expected a thick brick like the gaming laptop I owned before my MacBook Pro. years ago. The keyboard RGB looks really good but can also be toned down or turned off too ( lots of options) if you happen to get tired of it. The CPU and GPU seem to be top notch for this price. It seem if you wanted to get anything better you need to spend a lot more money and the 2070 should be able to handle everything currently you can throw at it. I do kind of wish it came with a thunderbolt port but I guess that was something they had to leave out to make the specs this good for this price point.,0
I was sent the wrong device and when trying to conduct a google meets meeting I discovered the camera doesn’t work. This device was advertised and shown as having a finger print feature and it doesn’t. Disappointed.,0
This is probably one of the best laptops in the market for the money.,0
"Bought two Samsung Chrome books for my kids with an extended warranty. Both devices ran very slow and several computer keys broke off of the keyboard within 5 months of use. I contacted Amazon on 2/23rd and spoke to a representative who is now trying to charge me a restocking fee. Due to the timing of returning the product being 7 days past the expiration date. They are not honoring their policy or extended warranty and a company that makes their customers eat so much as a restocking fee does not value their customer's loyalty. Not to mention, Amazon is getting too big to fail.... they will be the next giant conglomerate that will tank out economy.",0
"This laptop is very nice, thin, light weight, and the screen is good quality. I bought it for my husband as it was just time for an upgrade. The keyboard has a nice comfortable feel to it and he like the battery life as well.",0
"It’s been a few years since I’ve purchased a MacBook as I have anas I have been using windows laptops the past seven or eight years. My intent for using this one was for a consulting business I am a part of doing teaching presentations, etc. I wanted something that was small and traveled easy but also durable. Using this was a pleasure from the keyboard to the color and clarity of the screen. It feels good in the hand and seems like a very premium and quality product I use this laptop for a job one day recently and literally at full brightness for around 8 1/2 hours on its battery. What I found is I liked it so much that I added more applications to make this my daily laptop but the standard 8 GB it came with just wasn’t enough. I was getting RAM full warnings at least once or twice a day. I have since given this laptop to my wife who had a 2011 Air and have purchased a new 16 GB M2 version for myself. As nice and robust, and as good looking as this laptop, is I highly recommend it but if you think for a moment that you might need extra ram, go ahead and bump up to the next level. in my opinion, this is the best $1000 laptop on the market with the best battery life and quality overall.",0
Not good they renew one selling for Brand New !!,0
"I have only had this for a few days, but wish I had kept the packaging, because I would return it. This works ok with my home wifi but has not been able to find wifi in other public places that my ipad can work with. Had I known the limitations I would have bought something else.",0
"If you read the negative reviews, you will see that this computer has problems. The Wi-Fi keeps dropping and you have to dig deep into the computer to restore it to only have it occur a day later. Also, the screen size is small and if you are older, it will be hard to read unless you bump the document size up. You should also know that if you do have the Wi-Fi problem with the computer and return it within the timeframe that Amazon sets, the seller will charge you a 20% restocking fee.",0
We got a hard drive error almost immediately after purchase and have had nothing but problems with this machine since. Buy something else if you're able to.,0
"This laptop is elevated by its rubber feet 2 cm off the ground. This really allows more airflow to leave the laptop, which being an AMD system, gets hotter and uses active cooling more aggressively with performance. While this is a laptop that should not be used for long periods of time without an A/C connection, one can actually game at full performance for 4 hours consistently with both fans going at maximum. Thermal throttling takes quite a while (I could only get the 3050 Ti card to throttle after 1.5 hours of Doom Eternal at maximum settings).In terms of design besides the thermals, the laptop looks like a business class design with a couple of angles. This allows the laptop to fit into standard cases and backpacks.In terms of modification, this particular model has room for two M2 SSDs (including the SK Hynix supplied 500 GB) and two slots for RAM (2X 8 GB's of Samsung DDR4-3200 included in this laptop). Screw removal and replacement is extremely easy and no further dissembly of the motherboard is necessary to replace the parts.For someone who wants to game but still needs a laptop for work or light data science matters, the improved thermals and strong balance makes this laptop strongly worth recommending, especially at the price compared with other brands and components. While adding an SSD is a likely upgrade, the included parts are quite good and do not really need to be upgraded in place.",0
Excellent Computer - Easy to use,0
"Awful. Does not work properly at all. Sometimes it doesn't even turn on. When it does, it shuts down at it's own desired time. It is ridiculous. I have spent much time on the 1800 number and I am just fed up. Trashing it.",0
Muy bien producto y excelente precio,0
"Well, it does what I need it to. Bought this to be able to login and check resources on a game thats close to 20 years old. It can do it so I'm pretty happy with that. Though a smarttoaster shouldn't have trouble running SWG in this day in age. Not sure I will ever stress test this machine, just so happens I am not a fan of laptop computers. But it meets, and probably exceeds my needs in mobile gaming. Might even do some pvp on it someday if I find I am out of town and away from my PC.",0

"I have used this computer daily now for about 6 months, spending hours per day on it for an EMT/paramedic class. I haven't added any apps to it or done anything other than log into my online portion of school and complete lectures, so I can only speak for its basic tasks.It's extremely fast and has very little lag when opening pages or surfing the web.(*cough'Quizlet'cough*) I use this hooked up to my mobile hotspot from my cell phone mainly, and it allows me access anywhere I have cell service. At school my cell service sucks so I have it set to automatically connect to Wi-Fi and it works great. The size is perfect, it's easy to toss it in my satchel or backpack along with my textbook and notebooks and have plenty of room. I use the Amazon basics sleeve to protect it, and use an electronic mouse to help perform tasks a little quicker. It's highly recommended that you purchase an SD card for this to store any documents etc., as it doesn't have large built in memory. I feel this computer is perfect for students who don't want to carry around a large laptop and add more weight to your already heavy backpack, but can still perform most of the same tasks as the larger ones and do the majority of school work you need to do. I highly recommend.",0

"For 90 percent of the populous this will more than meet your demands. Extremely fast startup. More like instant. Picture quality is great. Operational speed very fast. Metal case. Automatically updates. Many apps available for it. No viruses.If you are tired of windows short comings and you mostly do internet based usage, then this is what you want. Low price to boot! In my opinion its a win win.",0

"You have many options to choose, you have to admit that. But this Acer is doing pretty good among all. 11th Generation Intel Core i3-1115G4 processor delivers unmatched speed and intelligence, enabling impressive creating, productivity, and gaming experiences. 15.6"" Full HD display with 82.58% screen-to-body, 16:9 aspect ratio and narrow bezels is good enough for daily uses. Do not rely on this PC for high performance resolution. Battery is as good as any HP or Lenovo. Almost two hours light usage is not bad if you just do some basic work.",0

I returned the laptop, and wanted another instead of a refund, but have not been able to express this since no one has contacted me regarding the return.",0
the temperature is not from the GPU but the CPU (over 90 Celsius spikes) that causes the fan to kick into turbo mode and super noisy,0

"I got this refurbished -- it still had someone's account on it. Not a big deal, just wiped it... but that's not what you want to see when you pay ~$1500 for a laptop. Leaves you with thoughts of malicious programs waiting to grab your personal information.Besides that? It runs every game. It's fairly fast, but for it's price... not that great tbh. You'd be much better buying a desktop. But wait... the reason you get a laptop is because it's mobile... right? Good luck. Not only does this get extremely hot, it has an atrocious battery life. If you don't leave it plugged in 24/7 you can't use it. The battery probably lasts 40-60 mins if you're just watching YouTube videos.I regret my purchase. A desktop has much better performance, especially if custom built, over a laptop of the same price. The only reason to pick a laptop is convenience of traveling. If you can't even use it for an hour before it dies... what's the point?I could get over all the short comings if it even had a 3hr+ battery life. I just feel I shouldn't be forced to spend like $100-200 on a portable laptop charger just to travel with this. Makes me wonder if I got a defective model, but it seems a lot of people complain about the battery life.",0
"I ordered this Laptop on a Friday and it was delivered promptly on Monday morning. For the. price this laptop is excellent: easy set up, item is as described. Only thing missing was a manual but that was remedied by going to the website with any questions I had.Good service by Fulfillment.",0
"I bought this laptop for my own personal use as a portable workstation when I need to work remotely for work. I have other laptops, but I believed that this would be a suitable replacement for two aging laptops with poor battery life.Problems I have with the laptop:The laptop you get has a 1.x ghz processor versus a 2.5 ghz processor as advertised.You DO NOT get 1-year of Office 365 at no charge with this laptop, just a one month trial.It does a terrible job of running Windows 10.After nearly a month of usage I have regulated this to a Linux workstation. I am currently running Xubuntu 18.10 on the device and it performs quite well given the actual specs of the hardware. Photos and documents load quickly and moderate web browsing is quite possible. The downside of running Linux over Windows is that you lose access to video streaming sites like WWE Network or Spectrum. It would have been nice to watch the football games over the weekend on my laptop.At this stage I am seriously considering a do-over on this purchase and getting a full refund.",0
The laptop was defective out of the box. The audio does not work and only produces a clicking like noise and no other sound. Spoke with the tech support and they said I had to send it in for repair and did not offer full refund even though they’re at fault.Power wise it runs games great. I just couldn’t hear anything.,0

Just what i needed 😉,0
"This is a great little computer, runs the internet very smoothly and has access to any word doc. needs. The only thing that I don't care for is that it is incapable of downloading many applications due to the fact that it runs on the chromebook operating system.

Well i was Searching for a good gaming laptop and i had to make it sure because i had to work hard for an year just to save up and so i did research for like 6 months on what gaming laptop i should go for and yeah i found the Asus rog strix scar 15 but still i wasn't sure. So i waited long enough to finally fix my mind and went through and bought this laptop and wolah this thing is a beast. This laptop is Everything i expected it to be actually more. From the design to performance everything is top notch in my opinion and i never been so hyped and happy. Any game i throw at it runs smoothly without any problems and yeah the RGB linings are so good. I am really glad i bought this laptop and i would totally recommend this to anyone out there : ),0

"I bought this laptop for my son and he liked it very much, great performance and screen quality is top notch.However, laptop keyboard start acting weird and certain keys started typing different characters and shortcuts. Tried Lenovo forum and all fixes in the web, can't seem to get it fixed.Not a very good experience as I've bought it from USA and I'm living is middle east, not sure I can get this fixed locally under warranty.Great laptop with weakness that can ruine the whole experience",0
"Performance is fine however if I had tried before buying, I would not have. Lacks a numeric keypad which I could believe, Limited number of ports led to needing to purchase a hub for the numeric keypad. Battery life is woeful.",0
Purchased in March and it stopped working by October.,0
Added a larger SSD storage and 4GB more RAM. Could not be happier with this laptop for the price. Picture quality is great. Much better than expected for a laptop in this price range.,0
"I ordered this laptop. The first laptop that I received stopped working after one week--it would not turn on whether or not it was connected to power. I tried a different power cord but it did not work.I received a replacement laptop, and one of the speakers did not work when received.Amazon did not allow me to exchange the second laptop. They did offer me a discount, but I need a fully functioning laptop so I returned the item. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it as I received two defective products.",0
"I'd be VERY cautious buying from this listing specifically. Check my photos for what I mean but this computer came to me, not only dead-on-arrival, but showed signs that this computer was not only use, but opened and modified.Here's why I think that:- All of the case screws were loose- One of the case screws was too long for the actual computer and won’t screw in all the way (as if someone lost the actual screw and used something else, every other screw fit correctly)- Not a single factory seal or plastic covering you'd expect from a new computer (plastic screen peels, foam, etc.)- Cables cable tangled and knotted- Pieces were missing- Computer blue screened out of the box, cannot boot.- The tape on the outside of the box is packing tape used unevenly.One of the big problems is that there is a red plastic piece that goes into the right side of the computer case. That missing piece is an encryption key that can be modified to lock down parts of the computer, like drives, folders, programs, or even the entire computer. What I've noticed from the pictures that many people are posting here is that ALL OF THEM ARE MISSING THIS PIECE. Whether they lost it them selves or aren’t getting it to begin with I can't prove. But I find it very hard to believe that every single person here lost it on their own terms.Good luck and God help you if you end up getting the computer I returned.",0

"Buena relación calidad precio, esta computadora debería de ser vista como una inversión, excelente para un inicio de clases y trabajo, pero la mayor aportación de la computadora, es que puedes agregarle más RAM y otro disco SSD sin dificultad, y aparte, conservar los predefinidos, por ejemplo, si agregas una RAM de 8gb, tendrás al final una computadora de 12gb, suficiente para correr programas pesados o inclusive algunos juegos actuales.Gran compra.",0

"I bought this to replace my Dell XPS and I love it. It's so fast and I don't have any 100% disk usage problems that plagued me for years despite tons of troubleshooting. I'm a moderate PC gamer but I also use Adobe CC a lot and this computer handles everything. I'll have multiple Adobe apps open and this thing runs with no issues. I spent so much time trying to choose between a surface device, a Lenovo legion, or an hp zbook. I'm so glad I saved myself the money and went with this laptop, it does everything I need and more!",0
"I really wanted to like this Chromebook. Good price. Adequate (but not great) display. Long battery life. But the keyboard just kills it for me. Somebody in the design group decided to increase the key spacing so that the keyboard fills the entire space. It's terrible. The keys are much further apart than on my ThinkPad and my multiple mechanical keyboards. Trying to hit backspace just gives me ""="". I just can't manage to type on this thing.I wish I could find a good replacement for my old Asus Transformer tablet & keyboard. I was hoping a Chromebook would fill the bill, but I am very disappointed.",0
I love the quality and ease of using,0
one month in and it's constantly noisy. even after factory reset. so annoying.Update:solved the noise problem! it came with macafee anti virus which hogged the CPU and the computer resources! after removing it the problem solved completely.,0
This laptop is amazing it's a good buy for somebody who wants to get into PC gaming but doesn't necessarily want to put their own PC together yes it's easy to build your own PC for the same price or possibly cheaper but there's a whole lot of headaches that go into that and it's really easy to mess it up so if you want to avoid headaches go straight to gaming this is your option this is your best bet one word of advice though if you don't want the fans to blow like crazy all the time open up nitro sense and select battery saver option for both AC and battery mode I get 200 FPS and rocket league 150 FPS and Counter-Strike very satisfied awesome computer.,0
"Honestly, I don't normally give reviews but I think it's necessary to give a review for this one so that I can help others. I am a Professional Photographer who literally only edit photos & a Little bit of videos and Minor Document work & browsing the internet; I purchased this Gaming laptop because it is capable of pushing High graphics but I don't know why Everytime my Wifi is on the Laptop over heats abd it took me a while to figure this out but I realize that everytime my Laptop is plugged in (AC Adapter + Wifi) it overheats significantly to the point that you can't even touch the laptop.This for me is a BIG Major turn off and I feel as though my money is wasted because this a Major inconvenience for me & my Photography Business. I never once played any form of high resolution games or any games whatsoever so I'm definitely disappointed & Amazon probably won't be able to do anything about it because it's over a year now. Don't waste your money on this Laptop.",0
"worst possible purchase. you would have a better online experience using a phonograph. it is so slow, regardless of wifi speed, crashes every 10 minutes, and is incapable with nearly every software. this laptop isnt even good if all youre doing is launching chrome and closing it out immediately: that would make it crash. youtube videos are impossible to watch, the moon landing broadcast had less lag. to delete a file you need to go thru 10 loopholes, bc you have to do that incredibly often bc theres no storage room on this. i absolutely hate it and am buying ANYTHING other than a chromebook in the future. google just wants to collect your information and watch you AND THATS IT. luckily, the camera quality on this is so bad there will be a blur covering what you dont want shown anyway, but its the principle. never buy this.",0
It is surprisingly small and light which are great qualities while still maintaining the feeling of a durable and structured laptop,0

I have a smaller touchscreen HP Chromebook that works great and has Play Store, but I wanted one with a larger screen.

"Ended up ditching Windows 10 for GNU/Linux (Solus Budgie) because Windows 10 ran very poorly. The hardware itself is fine for the price and I wasn't too worried about storage capacity as I mainly just use it to search the web when I go over to hang out with my friends and family. The screen is fine but uses a TN panel so viewing angles are poor, color accuracy isn't great but also isn't god awful either. APU runs cool, and standby time of battery is pretty exellent. It's a shame the computer out of the box is tainted by bloatware and a bloated OS.",0

"Purchased the laptop new from Amazon and received with a faulty power adapter (barrel plug is malformed). Immediately registered on Acer's website, followed their service request process to file a claim and began setting up the laptop. Had a full charge on the battery so I spent several hours on setting up the laptop, expecting that getting a replacement power adapter would be no big deal. Online chat to contact Acer support is completely offline for days at this time.Several days later, I receive an automated email that Acer is unable to complete my request for repair and that my next course of action is to contact the reseller. Should return the laptop to Amazon, undoing hours of work setting it up and maybe getting a replacement? Shame on Acer for complicating getting a working power adapter. At this point I'm ordering a replacement A/C adapter and remembering the poor warranty support experience before purchasing more Acer equipment.",0

"i bought this laptop thinking it would be perfect. i looked at a lot of other models and this one seemed the best and it was cheap. i found out first hand why that is when it arrived. first of all please avoid this laptop at all costs. it looks like a great cheap laptop. its defective from the factory. please research this for yourself. it ships with a firmware that will prevent the battery from charging. that’s right. from the factory it will brick itself and not charge. if your install takes too long or if you buy it and you don’t have over 40% battery charge to install the newest bios from acer, which voids your windows home s right off the bat, you are stuck with a brick. there’s no way to charge the battery. i got to go through the forced microsoft startup experience which took about 30 minutes to complete due to the computer deciding to get online and completely update windows with no way to bypass it first thing and then i wondered why it wasn’t charging. i found out at 15% battery remaining that it was a critical bios issue but if it dropped below 40% i would no longer be able to charge it. and that’s what happened. as i frantically sat with my brand new computer i tried to force the bios update, the machine hit 10% battery life, auto power saving hibernation mode instantly, i tried to reboot into windows and it’s bricked with a red battery logo now.acer should be down right ashamed for selling these and putting them on the market. read the other reviews. it’s likely you will buy one of these machines direct from amazon like i did sept 10 2022. i used it for a grand total of 45 minutes between opening the box, updating windows and critically updating bios only for it to brick. buy a better machine or don’t get one at all. my other machine broke down and i needed something quick and now. this would’ve done the job. it ended up letting me down right off the bat and cost me the time and effort plus my business lost revenue. unacceptable. F- rating.",0
Fans are kind of noisy when gaming or performing processor intensive tasks,0
"""They don't make things like they used to"" is the old adage that applies well to the Acer Predator Helios. My previous laptop (a Dell) was well built by comparison. There were no hardware issues for years. Then I bought the Predator Helios. To be sure, it's fast and colorful - but it's cheaply built. Within a few months the keyboard key symbols started to scratch off. Now the right fan buzzes and needs to be replaced. Sure, I could send it off to the Acer support center for repair, but I only have one computer, this laptop - I just need to live with it and watch this thing rapidly fall apart, unfortunately.",0

"I enjoyed this computer at first until I got new headsets for it and discovered the aux didn't work. Seems to be a pretty common problem and the fix was a factory reset. Which I did and it did work originally, then stopped working altogether again. Did another factory reset and now the computer just keeps overheating and shutting down. I barely have anything on this computer. It should not be overheating this easily. Don't waste your money. These issues appear to be common with a simple Google search.Edit: Changing from 2 stars to 1. Computer keeps overheating and crashing and the turbo setting, which sounds like a tornado, will no longer shut off. Giant waste of money. Do not buy.",0

I had previously purchased a “renewed” MacBook Air and it wasn’t exactly what I would call renewed. I returned it and found a new MacBook Air for under $900. Only a few hundred more than someone else’s old one and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve had iPhones since 3GS and they have always been user friendly and the MacBook Air is just like my iPhone but better.I have always had windows and the last one installed the manufacturer update and afterwards I could not log into the computer. That’s the end of windows and the beginning of my Mac attack.I highly recommend this item especially if you are able to purchase it for under $900.,0

"I was very hesitant on making the jump to a Chrome OS from a windows laptop. But since I have really outgrown gaming, and mainly use the laptop for business documents and web surfing, in addition to google apps. This was a good cheap alternative. The biggest drawback is that it needs to be connected to the internet using wifi to be completely effective. But it's lightweight, responsive, and the ever growing app ecosystem, it's very easy to do what you want to.",0

"I've had the ASUS VivoBook for about a month now and I'm very satisfied. The laptop replaced an i5 Lenovo that I purchased almost 3 years ago. It was slow and Windows 10 owned the thing.I love the Solid State Drive! If you're gonna run Windows, you have to run it from the SSD! I don't use Sleep any longer. Boot up to login are about the same time. The only reason this isn't a solid 5 rating is the need for a half gig SSD at this price point.I've run multiple CAD applications on the ASUS and I'm extremely happy with the speed, and graphics performance. The 1 TB hard drive holds these storage heavy applications with no issue and the hard drive response is acceptable for running an application. Strides have also been made with nominal weight reduction from my previous laptop and this makes an excellent road-going workstation. The build quality of the machine is excellent and I'm so glad to see a manufacturer paying attention to details like the keyboard. Touch typing with this machine is a breeze!I highly recommend this product.",0
"I personally love this laptop, in fact, I'm writing this review on this laptop, but that's only because it's the right laptop for my needs. This laptop is not for everyone, because I don't believe it's all that practical to be used for multimedia purposes, AKA, gaming and streaming, etc. There are specific reasons why I say this, and one of the reasons for that, is yes, just like the other reviewers say, the screen is a bit to be desired.First, I'd like to say that the screen isn't bad, it's just not great. It is a full HD display, but you do pretty much have to look straight at it to get a clear picture. You can see it okay from certain angles, but nothing too fancy. That's why I don't think it's good for multimedia, for example, if you want a laptop to stream movies and watch shows with friends and family, I would not recommend this laptop. It'll stream it just fine, because this computer is very fast, but the picture won't give a clear picture to a group of people watching it. However, if it was you, then I'd say go for it.The other reason why I don't think this laptop is good for multimedia use, is because of the audio. I am going to be brutally honest when I say that the audio on this laptop is absolutely horrible. I put max volume on my Spotify, and it the volume was so unimpressive, that I could comfortably hold a conversation with someone next to it. So, not only will the screen give a person issues, but unless you have a good speaker connected, you're not going to hear any music, shows, or movies very well with this one.I also don't recommend gaming on this laptop, not just for the reasons already stated above, but because of performance. This computer can perform very well at several multimedia tasks in terms of processor and memory, and you could play some simple games. But the moment you talk about WoW, or Overwatch... well, let's just say I don't believe this laptop was designed to be a gaming laptop.That all being said, I love this computer because I don't need a laptop for gaming, or for multimedia purposes. I am a writer, and I also love doing research, and doing basic stuff like checking email, or Reddit. For those basic tasks, this computer is actually quite phenomenal. Because of the SSD (Solid State Drive for those that don't know), it boots up very fast. It could be completely off, and from the time I push the button to turn it on, to the time the computer is ready for whatever task I want to do, barely 4 or 5 seconds have passed. That is not an exaggeration!The battery lasts for several hours, as long as you're smart about it. Like making sure the light on the keyboard is either off or low, when using the battery, and turning the screen brightness down. You can google tricks like that to extend battery life on all kinds of electronics, but as long as you do those basic things, the battery should last at least 6-7 hours.The processor is super fast, and I never have to wait more than seconds, if that, for the computer to act on anything I do. The moment I click on Google Chrome, the browser and my personal front page is up in less than 2 seconds. This computer is very fast, and despite what I've said before about the screen and audio, it actually does stream Netflix and all the other streaming apps pretty well.To anyone wanting to play games, watch movies with friends/family, or listen to loud music, I would not recommend this laptop. However, if you want a laptop to do everything else, I would not only recommend this laptop, but I would even go so far as to say that it's the best one on the market, for its price.",0
"Excellent performance. My only gripe is that the keys are hard to read for old folks like me. That said, I bought it for my children to use, so might not be a problem.",0
"The screen is vibrant and colors are vivid, they jump at you and are a pleasure to stare at for hours.",0
What I liked about the HP VICTUS 15.6” GAMING LAPTOP is the stylish and sturdy design and the picture quality is fantastic the graphics quality is great and you get a free Xbox pass upon purchase it’s easy to use and very easy to setup it’s a good value for your money and it makes a great gift for all ages and occasions it’s a good addition to your computer gaming system,0
"This is the best laptop I've ever used, ROG is the best and I've never used Asus before but this thing made me start to like Asus. it is so fast and the 120hz screen with the fancy lightning keyboard just make this computer so good. If you are looking for a laptop to play common fps game, this is the best laptop you can get now since Gtx1060 can perfectly run almost all popular fps games on the market now. Get it and its worth that price",0
"So I have never bought any Apple laptops off Amazon but it did arrive wrapped and packaged as if it came from Apple itself. Battery life is great, keyboard is great and it’s light. I don’t use laptop cameras so I can’t say either way on how good it is or isn’t.",0
"Pretty good laptop so far, small but packs a lot of power even tho it’s cheap.",0
Completely satisfied,0
Very happy & satisfied..,0
"Lightweight, beautiful screen, fast",0
"I bought this for a linux machine and it does that just great. Linux is a fairly light OS depending on the distro you use. For Ubuntu, it does the job just fine. While things are laggy what do you expect from a two core 1.6ghz CPU? Another thing, it is much thinner than expected.",0
It died after a few months. It said there was an error with the OS and it needed to be redownloaded. Tried multiple times at home and the tech guys at Staples couldn't figure it out either.,0
Quality of the LCD is the best I have seen in a laptop to date,0
We shall see how it holds up. I’m satisfied with the product. I only wish the seller would’ve allowed us to buy two as we have twins who both need one for school.,0
"It's so light and easy to carry around. I take it everywhere. And I love the fact that I don't have to buy Microsoft office because I can use google for everything I need. Google docs, Google sheets, & Google drive. Best idea ever! Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who ask me.",0
Esta muy bien para el precio solo la bocina no muy buena pero se le puede usar con bocina externa,0
"I bought this pc this week and it unnecessary gets really hot and the screen has glitching issues. For an expensive laptop as this, there is a serious lack of quality control by Asus.",0
Don't be afraid to buy refurbished. I'm not gamer so it works good enough for me.,0
i would of given it a 5 star but i have never used a chromebook before soo its a little confusing and harder to get used to is all.,0
"Bought this for my gaming laptop. it's awesome. picked it up on sale cause it's pretty pricey but it plays all my games above 60fps, usually more like 90-120. looks great, works flawlessly so far.",0
the battery does not last more than a couple hours under heavy game use.,0
Screen quality is just perfect. I looked and looked for the right laptop and I finally chose this one. I am so glad I made this choice. The laptop is everything I was looking for.,0
Great except the battery life is barely better than my old chromebook and significantly shorter than my dell inspiron and lenovo legion. The speakers are also kind've weak. But otherwise a great laptop for the price.,0
Disappointed with the screen quality. The picture is the quality of an 80’s tv and there is such a huge glare that it’s hard to use during the day. Would never purchase again!,0
Best laptop ever for the price,0
"As several other reviews have stated, the WiFi keeps disconnecting, which is really unfortunate considering I love the rest of the computer. Will probably return if there's no fix for this soon.",0
"The computer is fine for every application except gaming. Beautiful, lightweight, etc. Unfortunately, I had to check the Samsung website itself to see that the ""good"" graphics card is only available on the 32gb model.This $1000+ computer cannot run SKYRIM (SE) on its lowest setting. Be warned!",0
La compre para mi hermano y esta muy contento.,0
"It’s a great laptop for the price. Fast, slim, lightweight right great battery life. The keyboard is really one of my favorite features as well.",0
"This laptop replaces one I have had for about 3 years and was fine until my granddaughter spilled her water on just one corner of it, near the power button. this new one is pretty much an identical HP, other than the keyboard is backlit, which is an awesome upgrade!",0
"I went to the Acer Helios website to see if it was just me, and it sure isn't. This computer freezes a LOT during bootup. I bought it brand new and for whatever reason, 1 out of every 2 times that I try to power it on, it'll just freeze on the boot up screen forcing me to do a hard reset.Nobody on their website has managed to fix this issue when you comb thru the threads. I recommend staying clear of this one.",0
"The laptop is amazing, but windows 11 really takes away from it.Setup - Quick and Easy!Touchscreen - is easy to use and very responsive.Price - on par with similar brands.OLED Screen - Wow, just amazing and crisp. 4k video's look amazing!Noise - I have not noticed any noise minus a slight hum in a very quiet room from this laptop.Battery Life - Excellent lifespanI love the USB-C power cable and the fact that it can be on either side is amazing!Wifi and Bluetooth are awesome - I have connected a multitude of devices without issue.I have my laptop set up with a secondary monitor and run 4 Chrome Windows each with a few tabs - some pull more data than others and I don't have any lag or issues at all.Windows 11 - There are some issues here that make any computer not as easy to work on. The taskbar for one (you cannot resize it, you cannot ungroup the icons, you cannot have smaller icons, it doesn't show the time on secondary monitors and you cannot move it.) Setting the default browser in Windows 11 is very difficult. You need to set your default under HTTP and HTTPS. Zero offline local accounts. The interface requires too many clicks and it is not straightforward. And of course the main settings app doesn't include everything in any older Control Panel.",0
Its super sharp and the colors are rich and brings new life to your images.,0
"I had an old MacBook Air that was having problems. I didn't want to break the bank replacing it so I got this 2020 model. I was a wary of buying a computer online, but it arrived well packed and in pristine condition. The set up was easy. But a warning: when Apple says it's easy to migrate data from your old Mac to a new Mac over your residential wifi, don't believe them! To do it in a reasonable amount of time, you'll need to buy a Thunderbolt 4 and a type c connector dongle, so be prepared in advance. There's no ethernet port in this model and using residential wifi to migrate data is an exercise in frustration (would take 30+ hours). Other than that, I've had no significant issues so far. Battery life is very good.",0
"as a former ipad user, i am finding it a difficult adjustment to use the google system. some of the apps, for example facebook, do not operate as smoothly as they did on my apple device. i like the chrome book, it is an affordable and useful device for managing basic things like email and general internet use.",0
100% good.,0
Worked fine for a few months. Now it freezes about 4 or 5 times a day.,0
"Very pleased with my purchase of this computer. Very quiet, fast boot up, Nice touch screen. Very responsive keyboard. It is attached to three external hard drives. I have a massive music collection, a very large quantity of jpg files and about a terabyte and a half of video files. I am working on a multi media presentation of the history of the rock and roll era (1954 - 1985) This machine is doing quite a bit of the video editing, photo clean up, music file cleanup. It has been very good for my purposes up to this point and I do not expect it cause me any reason to change my mind.",0
"Excelente artículo lo recomiendo al 100% excelente sistema operativo, excelente tamaño lo recomiendo de verdad",0
I bought this a year ago thinking it was top notch because of the numbers. It crashed. I bought another one just because I'm hoping to take the hard drive out and replace it to the new one and save my work.,0
"It's very slim! Lightweight as well and it's my favorite laptop I've ever had. The speed is fast, but I assume because I don't have a bunch of used up storage. The screen is big enough for me, I don't need anything bigger. I use It for applications or if I can't see something good enough on my phone. Affordable price as well.",0
I am a grad student and casual gamer. When I get to play its for like 4 hours a couple times a week. This computer doesn't overheat or start glitching out. Tested it on vacation with a nearly 10 hour gaming session and the charge cord battery barely got warm. Super worth the money. This computer came with great features I didn't know I needed until grad school assignments surprised me. Very impressed. Would highly recommend this computer.,0
The touch screen works fine but I'm not much of a gamer but I'm very happy with this laptop.,0
"Llego a CDMX en cuestión de días muy bien empaquetada. El material muy resistente, la pantalla perfecta para cualquier juego hoy en día, RGB en carcasa, teclado y en la parte trasera de la pantalla. Puedes jugar cualquier juego de 2022 en alto y ultra. Este modelo viene con 16gb de RAM por lo que si quieres explotar el máximo potencial necesitas comprar más memoria RAM pero ojo con lo que trae puedes comenzar sin ningún problema. Viene con 1tb de almacenamiento pero también tiene una ranura para incrementar más memoria de almacenamiento por lo que a futuro puedes dar un upgrade y en caso de ser necesario meter otro SSD M2. Super recomendada.",0
"I purchased this last year when ASUS was selling the 2gb raam/ 32gb emcc (however, the storage space on my computer says my C drive only has 28gb total).Due to this low disk space, I have been unable to download the last several Microsoft updates. The windows OS is literally eating up 18 gb, the preinstalled apps 4.2gb, and the temp files, 3.45gb. That leaves me with a whopping 3 gb of space (definitely not enough to update, even with an external usb memory stick...nor can I reimage/factory reset my device due to low disk space). I have spent hours on the phone with Microsoft support, and they finally decided to send me a fresh usb with the latest windows.I am astounded ASUS would manufacture a device that can't handle the OS it comes pre-installed, but I guess it's my own fault for buying a device with such tiny memory. Lesson definitely learned. It looks like they updated to 64gb memory now, so hopefully new buyers won't have this problem, but I wish ASUS would do something for those of us who purchased the model with smaller memory and are now stuck with an essentially broken device.If it weren't for the disk space issue, I would be quite happy with this little device. It's sleek and great for writing, basic internet usage, and even some streaming/low demand games.",0
Gift for my college grandaughter,0
"Fine for gaming, but in graphics intensive games it runs hot enough to burn skin after 5 minutes. A $20 cooling pad has solved this issue.",0
"Works great and the battery lasts a long time. Super light and easy to manage. Take it anywhere, even better than a tablet because it has a keyboard.",0
the delete key is not over the backspace key it's over 1 key,0
"I love this little laptop; the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the storage limits. I removed Xbox and several other apps I won't use, added MS Office, Adobe's Pdf Reader and Paint.net......and only have 10 gbs of storage left, so I will have to be careful. Even so, it's lovely! Lightweight, fully functional and a perfect tablet with a keyboard! I wanted it for traveling, and it's perfect to take along!",0
Es de uso personal y su funcionabilidad es muy buena,0
Like the graphics it can doDislike the battery life and loud fan,0
"Playing games, the graphics processor pretty much screams.",0
"I have had a Google Chromebook & MacBook Pro as well as a Dell Desktop and I have to say that the Asus 11.6 is definitely a favorite! I onlyhave two recommendations, adding a micro SD card(I used a 128GB, roughly $22, works great) and if you plan on downloading apps that are NOT from the Microsoft store then take the laptop out of S Mode, you will see what I mean! But besides that, The design is slim and sleek, fits perfect inside of a bookbag. The battery life is amazing, screen and sound quality is very clear and clean as well! Full Windows 10, I use FL Studio, Photo Shop and Audacity completely fine with NO lag! I have also beenable to download a game or too such as Asphalt 8 and play without lag as well! Great purchase, definetly a steal for $150.",0
"Received yesterday. So far it's easy to use and pretty fast. The only bad thing is the screen resolution. It really is poor. Update, had to call acer tech support twice. It won't charge. Sent back for repair. At first they wanted to charge me for sending it back after owning for two weeks! Got it back, it still wasn't fixed. They sent a whole new power cord, it worked for a while but started the same again. What a piece of JUNK.",0
"Item did not work. Free return but spent $38 on insurance. Am still waiting for refund. I raised the star value to 4 as the unit did not work, but it could have been from something else. After all, the vendor has over 10,000 reviews with a rating in the 90's.",0
"First of all, this laptop is great for gaming. Keyboard and screen is flawless but it has a serious heating issue. But you can solve it with lowering CPU frquency (from power plan) or start cooler boost (it's very loud) and using a headphone. I had the fan clicking sound at fastest fan speeds. It disappeared after I accidentaly spill some water on it(don't try it). Body gets fingerprints very easily and it's annoying. It has a second 2.5 drive space and I installed an SSD. It's hard to open the case but be gentle, feels like it can brake easily. And lastly, it has some pointy edges on it's body, you may get uncomfortable when using it on your lap.",0
Nueva sensacion,0
Happily satisfied,0
"The sound/volume for some of the things I like to watch is a little too low even when volume is at maxed level. Other than that, it's a pretty good chromebook. It does what I need it for and I love how light it is as I roam around the house with it from time to time.",0
"Screen randomly goes black and wont turn on until I do restart the pc, bluetooth range so horrible, won't connect unless right next to it. I was so excited to buy a new laptop but now I'm disappointed.+Received replacement laptop and used it for 3months, works pretty nice and is above expectation.",0
Works great! Fast shipping too!,0
"User friendly right out of the box. It's super fast from start up to shut down. It's my go-to when I don't want to fire up the laptop but want something better than my phone. The battery life is incredible. Since I use Google apps for many things, this is ideal for me. Glad I got it.",0
"We took out the extended warranty on this computer, never received any paperwork. Does it come from Dell ?",0
"I needed a cheap laptop to install Kali on. This fits the bill but I had to fight with it to turn off bitlocker, disable the TPM and jettison Windows 11.I wish HP put more usb ports on it because two is not enough. It really should have an ethernet port too but, at least it was cheap. Fortunately usb hubs are cheap and readily available.",0
"Es buen producto pero con materiales muy ligeros, hay que darle un buen cuidado.",0
My mon love it easy to navégate,0
You will hear the fans when they run during heavy gaming to cool the high end CPU and graphics card,0
"I love this laptop! I didn’t want to spend too much as I don’t play many games and this was really worth it. The battery life is pretty bad but it’s understandable as it runs quite fast. I play the sims 4 with all packs and tons of extra content and it runs perfectly well, so I wouldn’t worry about that.",0
"I saved a while for this and it was completely worth it, Acer beats Dell by all Stretches after pushing this thing to it's limit with minimal heat.Also bought the Acer nitro mouse,mouse pad, looks stunning together.I've now been using this for almost a year before deciding to post a review, the battery has not degraded, and it can run off AC plugged in all the time and not damage the battery like conventional laptops.This was well worth the money and I have no regrets or complaints, and with windows 11 being released in 8 days I'm excited to see how much better it'll run everything!",0
Such a high quality and well-built piece of computing equipment. The M1 processor is a huge leap forward.,0
"I bought this laptop in June for my sister, who is a school teacher. She used it lightly over the summer and then for one week, in class, last week (second week of August)and it over heated and now it won't run. Amazon no longer has a 90 Day guaranty, only a 30 day.The call center lady wanted to help me, but could not ,because she did not have the authorization. All she could do was give me the phone number of the manufacturer, who would not answer their phone.Frankly I am shocked at this. This is the third Acer I have bought for my sister. In the past, they each lasted 3 years with heavy, classroom use. But not this one.Caveat Emptor",0
It showed up in pristine condition with no damages to the package as I would expect.,0
"Arrived chromebook in an undamaged box, no seals were broken on the chromebook itself. At initial start-up found screen to be damaged (see the picture). Returned the chromebook.",0
"If you just want to surf the net, I suppose it’s fine.",0
"This item was described as having cosmetic damages but after having it for 8 months, I can't tell that it was ever used by anybody else. Came exactly as advertised and has been the best laptop I've ever owned.",0
"The only downside is the metal for the keyboard it's kinda clunky and cheap, I feel sometimes will break",0
"La computadora cumple con los requisitos para un estudiante universitario, llego bien el producto muy protegido, es tal cual la descripción. Llego rápidoTotalmente recomendado",0
The keyboard is comfortable,0
"This chromebook is awesome but not for everyone. I work online using skype and buying this wans't a good choice for my work, the camera is awful and the appstore is not the best...Also using Microsoft word online is not as good as I thought. But if you're someone who just visit websites, listen music and basic things this is a great choice. Something that I liked is that you can download apps from Play Store like Instagram and It looks like the phone version. Not all apps are compatible with chromebook but as I said, for basic things this is okay. It's fast. I can say I'm 60% happy with this laptop.",0
"Pros:1) easy to upgrade (i installed the predator series GM3500 nvme SSD myself)2) excellent performance (witcher 3 maxed out except for nvidia hairworks runs around 110-130fps)3) super fast booting time4) good rgb keyboard5) overall good quality build6) good screen (it has a bit of backlight bleed but you probably wont notice unless youre constantly trying to find it)Cons:1) it doesnt have a mux switch2) predator sense app aint the best app, but it works",0
Bought it for my nephew as a gift. Looks good. But the CPU fan makes a big noise. Another customer said it will be no problem after two weeks.,0
did not come with the sd card that was supposed to come,0
This was bought as a Xmas present. It has met all expectations. Very pleased with this Chromebook.,0
"I did a lot of research before buying this laptop, and it's exactly what I had hoped for. I'm definitely pleased with the quality and price.",0
"I just unboxed this laptop today, so keep in mind that this is more of a first impression. This laptop is selling for $1049 on Amazon, but I've seen it selling at $100 more on a major website with only 8GB of Ram, compared to 16GB on this model. The specs on this laptop are great for this price and it is very up to date, sometimes OEMs will put slightly out of date CPU or GPU in their lower end gaming laptop, but everything in here is current generation. You get a fifth generation, H-series Ryzen 7 with a 45 watt TDP paired with a 3050Ti. This is one of the newest in the 30xx series from Nvidia and it's also on the lower end of the spectrum, it only has 4GB of VRAM and it serves as a replacement (hopefully) for the mobile versions of the GTX 1650/1660 cards which are starting to get older and don't support DLSS just like they don't have RT or Tensor cores. You get support for those higher end features with this card. Ray Tracing and DLSS upscaling can really make a huge difference in performance, especially with midrange cards like this one. This 3050Ti is powerful, it's just not up there with the 3070 or 3080. 1080p at 50-60 frames per second is what you should expect from this system, but with DLSS enabled, you can get more. This would be for the newest games at medium ish settings. You have to be careful because the manufacturer chooses to implement a given graphics card at a certain wattage, sometimes less than what is optimal. Lenovo says this 3050Ti has a max TGP of 95 watts, I think they are counting boost to get to this number. Nvidia says that 80 watts is the highest TGP that can be used for the 3050Ti, so you should be able to get all of the performance that this card is capable of, in this Legion 5.This laptop is really heavy, but that's a good thing, especially since this thing is all made from plastic. It means that there is a very substantial cooling system. Lenovo calls it ""Cold Front"" and it's the third generation of that design. You have controls for how loud you want the fan to get, it can get pretty loud when you are playing a game, but you can slow it down if you care more about noise than performance. The port selection is great, you get ports for days with this thing. 4x USB A, 2x USB C, 1x HDMI 2.1, 1x Ethernet, 1x headphone/mic aux, and power. Both USB C ports have support for DisplayPort 1.4, and the one on the back support Power Delivery. You will only want to use that as a fall back, since 100 watts is the maximum USB C Power Delivery is capable of at the moment, and this laptop comes with a 230 watt charging brick.The screen is good and supports lots of newer technologies. It's 165Hz, 100% sRGB, 10 bit color depth with support for Dolby Vision (and G-Sync + FreeSync). The only downside is that it only can go up to 300 nits of brightness, so I don't know how good the HDR content will actually be at that level of brightness. It's fine for standard dynamic range content, though. There are 2x 2 watt speakers and they sound good to me, they are downward firing. This laptop will make a great content consumption device, in addition to being a powerful gaming machine.I really like the keyboard, It's backlit with 4 zones of backlighting. The Lenovo Vantage app lets you save 3 profiles and change the pattern of the RGB lighting. It's great for typing, lots of key travel and keypress that feels satisfying. The trackpad is excellent, I was surprised at how accurate and smooth it was. I usually type my reviews on a Surface Laptop because I think Microsoft has some of the best keyboard/trackpad combos on windows, but I would be okay using this from now on.You can upgrade this laptop too, it comes with a 500GB 2280 NVMe SSD installed, but there is a second unused slot if you want to add more. I'm going to add 500GB more and report back on that. According to the Lenovo website, both slots only support 2242 or 2280 size NVMe drives. There are 2 SO-DIMM slots, each with 8GB installed, I don't know how much can be added successfully. The Lenovo page says that 16GB is the max, but I don't know if that is total or per slot.Performance has been great throughout my testing today, I will have more to say about that when I update this review after a couple of days of gaming on here. Battery life seems a little short, but I got less than 2 hours with the settings turned up as high as I could while playing Control. But it seems to drain quickly when not gaming, at least at maximum brightness.Here are some results from playing Control and messaging around with the settings:Medium/1080p/DLSS off/RT on =22-25 FPSHigh/720p/DLSS on/RT on =60-65 FPSMedium/720p/DLSS off/RT off = 85-90 FPSHigh/720p/DLSS on/Medium RT = 75-80 FPSHigh/1080p/DLSS off/RT off = 35-40 FPSHigh/1080p/DLSS off/RT On= 15-18 FPSYou can see that DLSS upscaling makes a huge difference, and having Ray Tracing is really nice but it can seriously reduce performance. This was while playing connected to power and in performance mode. Pretty good, though.Update: I’m really liking this laptop and it can perform really well to only have 4GB of VRAM. I think it’s up to each individual to determine whether a 1660TI with 6GB of 192 bit GDDR6 (4.884 Teraflops) would be more advantageous to have for their specific needs, compared to 4GB of 128 bit GDDR6 (5.299 Teraflops) on this with the perks of having DLSS, RT, and the latest Ampere architecture. It really comes down to the types of games (or other work) that you intend to do with the machine. This Legion 5 is a really good buy for $1050. I really like the screen too, it's very good for the price considering the specs of this machine. Just don't get your hopes up for the HDR content, 300 nits is not enough to really get the ""wow"" effect that HDR has on 1000 nit TVs.Update 2: Some newer games do not fare so well in my testing. Playing CyberPunk 2077 on patch 1.23 I was only able to achieve 30fps at 1080p with the lowest settings. Forget about Ray Tracing, it will bog you down into the low teens, sometimes dropping below 10fps. You really have to use DLSS to enjoy this game at a playable frame-rate. I was able to get between 45-60fps at medium settings, using the dynamic, automatic DLSS options where it will upsample from as low as 720p depending how many assets are on screen at any given moment. How TF did they (CD Projekt Red) ever expect this game to run on base level consoles (PS4 and Xbox One)???Other games, like ""The Outer Worlds"" run flawlessly on this hardware in Ultra settings at native 1080p, achieving 70-80fps. It just depends on how the game is coded, and how much VRAM is truly needed. I would check the recommended configuration (not the minimum requirement) to see if the games I was most interested in playing are suitable for this hardware. Some people are going to be better off spending the extra money and going up to a 3060 or 3070 GPU if they can afford to.This comes with 3 months of Stadia Pro, Amazon Music Unlimited, and a Dropbox 100GB plan (for whatever that may be worth to you).6 month update: This machine has continued to work well for me, and I still use it regularly for gaming and other tasks. I have not had any issues that required any kind of support. I added a second 500GB NVMe to increase the storage to 1TB, I may double the Ram to 32GB later on. I still think this is a good buy but that is at the $1050-$1100 retail price it was listed when I received it. It’s currently priced in 3060 territory($1500ish) and that GPU is a lot better because the 4GB of VRAM on this 3050Ti does hold you back in the newest AAA single player games. I hope this nightmare ends in 2022 and we see GPUs return to their normal price, this is getting absurd how long this has been going on.",0

"Great, lightweight laptop, at a very affordable price. Came ready to go out of the box. Just had to charge it a little but it fired up in about 3 seconds. After about 2 mins setting up my info for Gmail, it was ready to go. All my settings transferred over. All my Chrome bookmarks did as well. Screen quality is very good. Sound is good as well. Keyboard types quietly. So far, it's exactly what the advertisement says it is. Perfect for anyone that just needs to surf the internet, or work on Google Docs/Gmail related items. Great for the price. Very fast!",0
This is a great value! Runs Revit and Autocad perfectly!,0
"I got this budget laptop because of the full HD panel, decent I/O, and serviceable RAM and storage. Just installed Ubuntu 20.04, and I added memory (16GB), and an additional 1TB 2.5 SATA for storage (you need a SATA cable and a caddie to keep it in place; available at Amazon). Not too crossed by the lack of backlit keyboard, but otherwise running like a champ, including WiFi!",0
"On paper, it looks like a great laptop, and games do run as you would expect them to. But there are numerous issues that ruin the experience. First, and foremost, there is sleep. Dell has completely disabled it in favor of connected standby. So unless you shut your computer down, you are likely to pull the laptop out of your bag with a dead battery and the entire thing hot to the touch. This is unacceptable for a portable device. Additionally, battery life is mediocre, even for a gaming laptop, and the thermals are poorly designed. Even just browsing the web will leave this laptop too hot to sit in your laptop. And during gaming sessions, the fans will blow hot air right over your hands making the experience uncomfortable. Frankly there are are too many better options at this price point. I would suggest looking at those.",0
"Not sure exactly what must've happened, but I guess I was one of the unlucky few who was given a botched version of this laptop. Right out of the box, it was completely unable to operate the webcam, no matter what I did to try and fix it. The trackpad would occasionally lose control and start acting very sluggish, sometimes for a minute or more, before snapping back to a normal speed. Various other glitches would arise, some of them lingering, some of them starting and stopping. What's going on?I can't say I'm exactly interested in the idea of explaining my problems one after the other to someone far away for an hour or more over the phone and hoping that I'm doing a good enough job at presenting my problems, while on top of that hoping that there's even a fix to my problems, while also on top of all that, hoping that the fix won't require me to send the laptop away. Right after getting it. Brand new. It's been an incredibly stressful couple of days...I really wanted to like this laptop, but there's just too many red flags already that even if I did manage to find fixes for the problems, I'm convinced it would be a matter of time before more arise. And then what? Is the warranty still in effect? Maybe not. Then I perhaps have no choice but to wait for days, weeks, while Acer has it and fixes it? What if I need it for work? And I'm hearing a lot about black screens? I don't know. I get anxious thinking about the whole process.Seems to me like if you enjoy gambling and don't mind figuratively rolling the dice, you could get sixes and land yourself a flawlessly functioning version of the Helios 300. Please don't get me wrong. I've heard TONS about how great this product is. It's what convinced me to seek it out. It does look very great, and I didn't even notice any serious backlight bleed, which I notice is a common complaint. But... I was not part of that group. I was stressing quite seriously about having spent the money I did, waiting, getting this, and immediately noticing there was no working webcam. Try some things. Still not working. Try more things. Still no. More. No. I had to stop myself sometimes, because it was so troublesome. The more time pass, the more I did, the more I wondered... Why is it this hard to get something so basic to work, in a laptop like this no less? Now the trackpad is giving me trouble? What is next?I can't give this one star, though my experience was unfortunately a very uncomfortable and frustrating one. The laptop still comes with impressive specs. It's just... I can't trust any of it to last. Not with this many problems on day one.I'm going to have to wait several days now (perhaps 14+ days after they get the laptop back) to get my refund and hopefully not repeat this process with another laptop in the near future. I'd seriously advise anyone who is looking into buying this to understand what they might be getting into. Emphasis on the word ""might"". Apparently, some people having glowing machines. I'm unfortunately among those who didn't...",0
"I cannot recommend you purchase this model. My left hinge froze after 3 years, breaking the cover and the screen. Do your homework. There are many others who have experienced this failure. Samsung blames users. Very expensive to repair, and repairs put the same old hinge design back in place.Other than this, I had no other issues.R",0
Our high school boys are required to have a Chromebook for school. I had purchased two of the ASUS Chromebook C202SA-YS02 and it was the worst experience I had ever had with an with an electronic device. Both of the ASUS Chromebooks had to be sent for repair three times! Literally when we got the ASUS Chromebook back form the repair center it would stop working the day we got them back. Right now as we speak one of the ASUS Chromebooks is back at their repair center in Texas and we are awaiting its arrival as my son loses points in class for not having the Chromebook. As for the other ASUS Chromebook they finally gave me my money back after the third repair. I did some research and chose the Samsung Chromebook. Immediately my son was able to see the difference between both brands and it is working like a champion! The journey began in December of 2019 and now we just need to see what is going to happen with the other ASUS as it is now in repair for the 3rd time as well. I am hoping they give me my money back and I can purchase another Samsung Chromebook. You will not be disappointed with Samsung! They are a true contender in the Chromebook game. The aesthetic is top notch and its performance is second to none. Battery life is long and everything about it is perfect! No complains here! Thank you Samsung!,0
"Some of the reviews mention the touch screen, which this one does not have",0
"Had to return first one after a day. Second lasted a year, but is now dead.",0
"Muy bueno el equipo, pero me le cayo agua y se me arruinó la tarjeta madre, ya no la tengo en uso. Cuánto me costará una tarjeta de esas",0
I bought this on a Amazon treasure truck ? deal. I read many reviews before the purchase and many complain of issues connecting to wireless. I have had no such issues nor any other issues. Matter of fact this is the best PC I have ever used personally. I find I never have to wait on it to do anything. It boots up faster than any previous PC I've had. Now it only comes with a free trial of anti virus software so I simply use avast one free edition but you also have the option to use windows defender at no charge at it has improved alot over the years not as good as avast but almost. Overall I find the unit to be an excellent value and would recommend it!,0
10/10 completely met expectations.,0
"The left/right clicks does not extend to the lower corners of the pad, you have to click about one inch away from the lower corners of the pad if you want a mechanical click",0
I Wish it came with upgrade options such as 1TB SSD and 32gb ram,0
The screen image appears blurred and the screen glitches continuously.,0
"I've had a pretty bad experience with mine (ryzen 7, 1tb, 3050ti). The dialpad completely stopped functioning after a week, having only used it once to adjust volume, while never leaving my desk since unboxing. The wifi drops out constantly (and I have an excellent home network). The keyboard is really abysmal, I mean honestly it's quite awful - both the tactile feeling, key travel, and layout since the touchpad is not centered with the space bar I am constantly resting my right palm on it which is uncomfortable and causing many accidental swipes/ clicks and typos. The HDMI connection to external model is very outdated, (1.4), causing very laggy transfer and low resolution. There shouldn't be outdated hardware on a newly released laptop design. There is a glaring obvious defect of the touchpad having a wide gap on the left exposing hardware inside the laptop, also the audio jack is not centered to the cutout. The sound is TERRIBLE, I get better audio out of my 6 year old android phone than this supposed ""creator"" laptop; the quality is disgusting, which I can deal with on a laptop, but the max volume itself is like a whisper. I cannot hear people on online zoom or teams meetings, youtube, hulu and netflix. Forget about it, can't hear a thing. I have also been experiencing frequent screen glitching where a ""ghost"" shadow of a window stays on the screen constantly until I reboot the system. Lastly, there is an awkward gap on the left side of my touchpad where some of the internals behind the touchpad are exposed- BAD quality control here, the touchpad was attached askew and not centered correctly to the cutout. I really wanted to like this laptop and trust ASUS build, but frankly it has been an epic disappointment, especially for $1550 after tax. I will be returning it today and would not recommend this version until they fix their QC. I'm starting to think Amazon just sells the factory rejects of most laptops.",0
"Computer crash in 1 month,for all that money it sucks.",0
It's very light,0
Very surprised at the quality of this computer.,0
A little over a month having this and it’s not working right! Would not recommend.,0
Its really a great laptop. Overall good for playing. The only thing that would need improvement would be the battery life.,0
"For an 800$ laptop I was extremely disappointed on how terrible it was. I unpacked it, set it up and I already run into a problem where it has to trouble shoot and reset, it takes about an hour but after that it started to work and I didn’t think much of it. When I install the games I want to play I realize that this laptop was extremely pathetic. I get on Minecraft with optifine and I get a maximum of 20 FPS, now if that’s not bad enough I get on geometry dash and I can’t even play the game without it freezing every few seconds. Then after a week of having the laptop it crashes and I can’t even log back on. I’ve trouble shooter for 3 days now and not a singular piece of luck. My old used laptop that was 400$ ran faster and longer than this 800$ GAMING laptop. Please, if you want to buy a good gaming computer, get a pc.",0
"I have had excellent luck with other Asus products but this one is a thorn in my side! It flat out doesn't work, I've had to reset it several times since I purchased it in January. Finally just gave up and spent the extra money for a good HP with a hard drive. In fact, I am attempting to factory reset this piece of crap and hope someone will buy it resale. By the way, I have never ever written such a negative review on any other consumer product. I used to rave over Asus products, maybe I just got a lemon but this machine is a total headache!!!!",0
"I do not have to much experience with lab tops. But Overall the computer is lacking in all qualities from what I can tell, with horrible screen quality no touch screen and half the battery life that was advertised. I had never used the chrome OS and realized it’s very limiting.It’s much slower than I expected it would’ve been. Amazon recommended I buy antivirus with it so I did. Only to realize the chrome os will not accept most anti virus software. In the end I figured $300 would get me an okay labtop I wasn’t expecting too much but I’m incredibly dissatisfied.",0
Not quite the laptop functions I expected or required. Still good for internet use though.,0
Me gustó porque es bastante accesible y con el aumento de ram y el espaico de disco duro extra la hace increíble,0
"Good quality, good condition",0
"My district has provided Chromebooks for the students, but not the teachers. I decided to order this model for so I could familiarize myself with my students' experience. I now use it in place of a laptop and really enjoy it. It is lightweight and does not get hot. The battery lasts longer than my laptop. I did find myself getting headaches with extended use, so I ordered blue light glasses which solved the problem.",0
Wasn't looking for a super fast gaming laptop or anything heavy duty. Been working from home like most of us and really needed to upgrade. Pleasantly surprised with quality and price point.,0
"Very disappointed with this laptop. Was very excited to use it for my new job, but it came defective. Sound didn't work, WiFi didn't work, and when trying to update it, it took way longer than it should have with 16gigs of ram. No troubleshooting steps found on the internet, and yes I tried everything, works. Returning and buying an unfortunately less attractive HP. Screen was beautiful, though.",0
I bought them for my granddaughters and the absolutely love them!,0
I love the design and materials and handling,0
"I bought this Chromebook basically out of curiosity. I've never had a Chromebook before but I have owned Windows, Apple, and Linux systems. I wanted to see just how useful it really is when used as a laptop replacement. I think a large percentage of the laptop community still has no freaking idea what chrome OS is. They were spoon fed Windows from birth. This review will make sense to the tech community, for the Win world - not so much.This Chromebook uses a somewhat customized version of Android operating system. My reading suggests about version 4.4. Before you let that dissuade you from getting one, it actually works quite well. The screen is not touch sensitive, but the track pad recognizes a two finger touch as a context menu - akin to a Windows right click. Access to the play store allowed me to quickly populate it with everything I needed to get through my day. I can work with zip,tar, and other compressed formats, and open almost any file I set my sights on. The one exception was a docx word file. My word processor only handled doc files. I could probably get around this by using the online version of MS Word but haven't tried that yet. Since tax season is coming up I tried three of the more popular online tax packages to see how they worked with it. I was able to work in TurboTax, Taxcut, and H&R block without any issues. The TurboTax version uses a very cool import to take a PDF copy of your W-2 and import and fill in all the fields. This worked flawlessly. I was also able to connect my wireless brother printer in a matter of minutes. This is kind of impressive for an older version of Android but by simply downloading the brother application for printers, I had set it up without hardly in any intervention from me. It just found it, like Win10 does with wireless printers. This Chromebook comes with 32GB of storage but has the ability to use an SD card for an upgrade. I was able to upgrade it with an additional 256gb for no more than $65. the response time on applications was well within the margin of what you would expect for a normal laptop. Everything opened quickly and applications did what they were supposed to do without any hesitation. I will say that on first impressions, the plastic casing of the Chromebook looks kind of cheap. but then again it is kind of cheap at less than two hundred dollars you're not going to get a stainless steel case. This would make a perfect workbook to take on a plane and get some work done or something to just sit around and browse internet all day. The battery life is supposed to be at around 11 hours and from what I've seen so far it looks like it would make that. I was able to use it off and on pretty much all day and only used about 50% battery reserve. It is also less than 3 pounds. It's so light you can forget you have it with you. It also is not bad for watching movies on. I installed the Netflix app and streamed several hours of video with no drop outs. All said, I think this makes a good inexpensive all around computing device as long as you have generic tasks; watching videos, browsing, writing your book. If you don't need to compile code for your daytime job you will do fine.",0
Keyboard is surprisingly comfortable to type with,0
Love my chrome book. Bought for college online and it exceeds expectations.,0
Not a bad laptop for the money and dose all I need being as I do not game.Screen is of reasonable resolution and brightness only odd things is for the best viewing it seems to need to be at a larger angle than you would expect.System responds quickly and battery life I would say is avg and lasted about 3 1/2 hours for me under full load streaming HD video. The volume seems a bit low but that might be because they are under the laptop.Note! This is a USB-C 3.1 and not 3.2 and will NOT display videoThere are a few personal issues.FIRST the microSD slot is not the kind that you fully insert the card into so it sticks out. This for me at least is annoying as I use a 256GB microSD for storage.The SECOND issue is only if your going to run Ubuntu. The laptop uses Intel Rapid Storage Technology and that needs to be disabled. When you change it in the BIOS windows will not boot since it can no longer find the C drive. I ran thru the steps to try and correct this however that failed so I had to reset windows completely after I disabled RST in the BIOS. So if you are going to run Ubuntu do that before you do anything with windows as you will have to reset it.,0
"The Acer Predator Helios 300 is a mid-tier gaming laptop. The metal and plastic construction, makes a bit sturdy and it comes with very good hardware in this price point.The screen is bright enough, better than the advertised 300 nits. It was able to reach 300 nits at around 75% brightness, and at 100% brightness it went up to 371 nits...not to shabby for a gaming display.The display is fast at 144Hz @ just 3 ms and the color gamut was quite good 99% sRGB and 78% aRGB and just 83% DCI-P3. It should be able to handle photo and video editing and content creation like champ.There is a bit of light bleed on top right and top left of the display on the unit I have.The keyboard has a backlit 4-zone RGB and the it isn't bad, but the keys are a bit mushy to the touch. I just prefer a firmer keyboard keys...maybe I am bias because I use a mechanical keyboard. The Microsoft Precision Touchpad worked without issues and has been very responsive and accurate.The USB C 3.2 Gen 2 port comes with Thunderbolt 4 and USB Charging and next to those ports HDMI 2.1 with HDCP support and Mini DisplayPort 1.4. There are two USB A 3.2 Gen 1 ports and USB A 3.2 Gen 2 that supports Power-off Charging.The Thunderbolt port is might fast. I was able to reach 8.5 Gbit/s (1062 MB/s) speed copying files. You could transfer a 4k 25GB film in 20 secondsThe Predator Helios 300 comes with a full Gigabit Ethernet port so you won't lag for lack of reliable Internet connection.And if you happen to have a Wi-Fi 6 internet, the Killer Wi-Fi 6 is as fast as the Gigabit LAN.The sound is tiny, since the firing down speakers are tiny. The speaker area is 19mm thick and some laptop as thin as 13mm have been able to fit louder and better sounding speakers...of course they cost a lot more.A least Acer included Dolby DTS X software that works great with external surround speakers or headphones, and you will need them if you want real sound.There are 2 DDR4 RAM slots, each one with 8 GB DDR4 3200 MHz RAM for a 16GB DDR4 total, upgradeable to 64GB DDR4.Acer included 2 NVMe M.2 slots, one occupied by a lighting fast 512GB Samsung PCIe 4x4 NVMe capable of 6900 MB/s read and 5000 MB/s write speeds. Also there is a 2.5"" SATA bay available. Acer included the SATA cable and screws in the box. In case you have a 2.5"" HDD or SSD lying around and don't want part ways.During tests the Samsung NVMe went above rated speeds on both read and write performance.The battery is on the small size for a 15.6"" gaming laptop. I would have prefer a larger capacity battery, instead of a 2.5"" SATA bay. At least Acer came up front about the battery running time. They stated the 6 hours and how they achieved that results (Battery life was tested using video playback).So make sure you have the power adapter next to you while gaming, since the battery won't last much unless you dial down screen brightness and disable the dedicated graphics.The Predator Sense App have several settings to adjust lighting, fan speed and performance settings. There is 'Default', 'Extreme' and 'Turbo' options available. Setting the system to 'Turbo' increases system performance and consequently also increases fan speed exponentially. Of course, is necessary to keep the Intel Core i7 and the NVidia RTX 3060 cool and churning reducing throttling.The cooling system does a very good job keeping the airflow going and it does even better job at cooling if the laptop is raised a couple of millimeters.There isn't much to do in the BIOS, beside disabling the intro sound.Acer does a very good job with the Predator Helios 300 performance and excellent pricing. The laptop is very responsive and it can handle most games above 60 fps on high settings. It has good build quality and the screen is even better than described.It will be hard to find anything better at this price point and down the road you could upgrade RAM and M.2 SSD to keep up with never ending tech evolution.The screen felt a bit flimsy, since it has a flexes a bit more than I would have liked. Avoid opening the screen from the sides and try opening right on the center.CrystalDiskMark Read 6173.70 MB/s / Write 5062.66 MB/sHandBrake: 6 min: 52 secs (convert 12 min: 13 sec 4K video (Tears of Steal) to 1080P MP4Cinebench R20: 4841 ptsCinebench R20: 13271 ptsGeekbench 5: 1564 Single-Core / 8189 Multi-CoreUnigine Valley: 7724Unigine Superposition: 11003 (1080P High)Unigine Superposition: 4853 (1080P Extreme)PCMARK 10: 62933D Mark Fire: Strike 18967 / GPU 20907 / Physics 23147 / Combined 96443D Mark Night Raid: 43672 / GPU 79098 / CPU 12344Color Gamut: sRGB: 99% / aRGB: 79% / P3: 78%Latency monitor: System suitable to handle real-time audio without dropouts.",0
"Who looks for where the speakers on a laptop are located? Next time, I sure will. This laptop has a lot of power and storage space, it's light-weight, but if you enjoy decent sound out of your laptop speakers, don't buy this. Unknown to me when I was researching buying a new machine, some laptops now come with speakers located on the BOTTOM of the device. My old one had speakers on top near the lid and produced good sound. The sound on this machine is horrible, especially if you have it in your LAP, as in laptop, where they can be muffled.",0
"Bought this for the price and reviews .. so freaking slow!!!! And the image quality is pixelated! Feels like cheap plastic when typing. Will be returning and buying something faster and more high end. If you've never used a better laptop, you won't know the difference... But my phone is better than this laptop!",0
"Less than 6 months old, had to replace screen myself (Sent to warrant at 3.5 mos..not covered), now the operating system crashed and missing...absolute junk, and their tech support is useless! I'm glad I got this for my Mother at alow price, now they have gone up almost $100 more for the same junk because of the pandemic. Samsung made the Do Not Buy again list....done with their terrible products...same price get an HP...overall better ratings also",0
"Diría que todo está muy bien, pero su único inconveniente es la poca vida de batería, ni siquiera me llega a una hora en videojuegos, hice una prueba de solo tener el navegador y ver videos, e igual solo dura aproximadamente 56. Minutos, eso un horror de batería, la verdad recomendaría comprar otra laptop aún si es un poco más cara, porque no es posible que ni siquiera llegué a una hora de uso sin tenerlo conectado, no lo devolveré porque realmente lo necesito, pero probablemente compré otro para el siguiente a?o. Los videojuegos y aplicaciónes van 120fps fluidos. Juegos como Genshin Impact, Fortnite, Warzone, Overwatch, Battlefield V, etc. Van muy bien y muy bien fluido, dejando a lado la vida útil de la batería está muy bien y de buen aspecto, pero reitero, es mejor buscar otro al menos por 100 dolares extra.",0
"Amazing for school work, very fast web surfing, good streaming speed and quality. Love the hdmi port inclusion.",0
"It's ok. 16GB does not leave much actual free space (under 10GB) to use for the Android app support, however.",0
Fast starting,0
"I've had this for two days and it's the fastest thing I've ever touched. But for my specific purposes, this laptop is the ideal.",0
it is light and this feature is very important for me since I carry it to school with me.,0
My first chromebook that I bought for my boyfriend. This chromebook works well and it is pretty big. It's pretty fast and easy to use. The battery last long and the speakers are pretty loud. So far no problems and I will definitely will recommend this laptop.,0
"Can easily play any game on ultra settings you throw at it and it really isn’t that loud when you’re playing. Only thing is that it eats up battery but since most people are going to use this laptop to game, it’s only customary to keep it plugged in. Although it does have that portability option. For 2k, I’d say if you’re looking to buy this machine go for it. The build quality, aesthetics, and performance are astounding. 11/10-also, It doesn’t have a camera but it isn’t a con for me",0
This laptop has exceeded my expectation and has taken my video editing Capabilities to another level.,0
"I use this laptop specifically for gaming, because I don't have a gaming PC. This laptop gets the job done. I get about 80 frames per second on most call of duty games, and I get about 40 on cyberpunk 2077. This won't get you speeds like 120 fps, and there isn't support for 4k, but if you're ok with 1080p and a frame rate that STILL beats next gen consoles, this is a great buy. To be clear, 1080p at 80 fps, with ray tracing turned on thanks to that GTX 2070 GPU, still looks phenomenal, especially with the 144hz screen included. It has met my expectations on a great gaming laptop, all with the exception of not having very good battery life, which is to be expected with a laptop being used so extraneously. When i have max settings playing a game, I can maybe get an hour of battery, so I recommend keeping it plugged in for those long gaming sessions. This was a great addition to my set up and i recommend it either way.",0
Bought this for my 6 year old to do school work during the pandemic. He loves it! It’s easy for him to navigate using the touch screen and being able to hold like a tablet is more manageable for him.,0
Heavy screen bleed in upper right hand corner on first boot. Otherwise good quality picture. Returned. Photo is supposed to be an all black screen with the exception of the mouse.,0
"Fast boot-up. ... Using crouton i installed Ubuntu 16, but there were problems, so i deleted Ubuntu and installed Kali-rolling which works. But with Kali i get (so far) no audio. For now, i don't need audio. Kali does work with USB peripherals like the HackRF and the Yardstick One.",0
No option to connect to the internet/Wi-Fi,0
Great!,0
"It works perfectly, it meats my expectation. I am very happy with this product.",0
"My background: I'm a college student, so I use it for schoolwork and games sometimes. I never had a gaming laptop before.I've had it for a month now; I got it for $200 off, which is a great deal, though I would not recommend buying it for full price; from what I read, there are better laptops for the price range. It has a lot of useful features, like the cooling boost and shift. I'm not a fan of the default colors on the monitor; it looks too white, but I turned up the contrast so it looks better. The audio on the laptop isn't too good either, but I usually use headphones so it evens out. The speakers are also closest towards you on the bottom, though the laptop slants down anyways so the design seems pointless.As for gaming, I mostly use it to play League of Legends, which I can run at max settings and have it perform perfectly, which is great! Fortnite is the other demanding game I play, which runs at 75% max settings; still works and looks great. Everything else is on Steam and isn't that demanding, like Age of Empires 2.The laptop feels pretty sturdy for transportation, which is good when I take it to the library to study. The touchpad is slightly to the left, so sometimes my left hand will drag the cursor down the screen a bit or jump to a different part of a paragraph, which can be annoying while writing a paper. It has a fast startup time. The screen itself reduces glares a lot and makes it easy to see in bright areas; I've never had to turn the brightness above 30%Overall I'm satisfied with it.",0
"Nice product, no CD-ROM is sometimes an issue",0
it has a pretty minimal battery life,0
I deleted a previous review.......good computer.....set-up was complicated and frustrating due to security concerns. Now it is set up and working great! It was user confusion that was frustrating.,0
"The laptop uses a powerful cpu in tandem with a upper midrange gpu to provide good performance overall, with decent battery life and the ability to charge it using USB Type C portable charging. There are some strange problems with my specific unit, but they haven't interferred while gaming or doing work, so I would recommend this laptop if it goes for around $1100, as it then has excellent value.",0
"Absolutely love the laptop. It's been close to a year now that I have been using the latop. One of the best one's I have owned till date. Really changed my perception of Asus as a company. Will make the decision again. Great battery life, quick and sleek.",0
"I didn't expect the battery life to be so short. This is my first laptop so I'm not sure if it's a trade-off from all the other great features, or if that's how gaming laptops are due to the system's demands. Besides that, I love it! I'm currently in tech school and it's working amazingly for my work and the few pc games I play. I 10/10 recommended this to my friends with the note that the battery life only lasts about 5 hours at 100% with the highest setting on for power saving.",0
"Let me preface this by saying, I normally use a work laptop for everything so I know absolutely zero about computers. Recently I left my job and took some time off to find a new one and my old laptop died right before I was scheduled to have 5 interviews. I went to Best Buy and talked with a sales guy and told him my budget and what I needed a laptop for (interviews, using Microsoft office suite, using my cricut) and he found this computer for me. It arrived in 1 day and was easy to set up. I love that there is an independent keypad for numbers. I got through multiple zoom meetings with no glitching. The battery life is great, it’s light weight, and is pretty fast when loading programs. I have zero complaints. There was a prompt about touch screen but I honestly didn’t know it came with one (if it does) so I’ll try that and edit my review. Overall, I’m very happy and if you need a basic computer at a decent price point this is it!",0
I purchased this product in January 2019. In March of 2018 it was taking forever to power on. Yesterday it stopped starting up all together. It's not the power cord and the battery is not dead it just doesn't work. So you have officially been warned do not purchase from this seller because their Electronics only work enough until the 90 day warranty is up and then it stops. So now there's nothing that Amazon can do. I would give it a 0 Stars but Amazon wouldn't allow me to do that.,0
"I'm clumsy and this machine runs smooth. I don't have it right in front of me, but I don't think I have a chip on it. I used it for city promotional exams and it did everything I needed. One of my best ever value buys!",0
"I love this laptop! It's fast, easy to use, and is great for using with my Cricut. I love the feel of the keyboard and the scroll pad, too!",0
"Overall I've been very pleased with this laptop, however, I've only had it for 3 months and the power cord is totally worthless. It's cheap and has fallen apart. The only other issue I have is that it gets very hot!",0
Battery life is superb,0
"When working on it, the system would keep shutting off even when power was connected and battery was fully charged. Return it and got money back.",0
"This is by far the worst computer I have used in the past 20 years. It doesn't come with Microsoft office, this is why this laptop is cheaper. The product spec claims up to 3.4 Ghz, when you open the task manage it states it's a 1.6 Ghz, far cry from 3.4 Ghz. I bought this laptop to do word, excel, surf the Internet and read e-mails. This morning, it took about 5 minutes to open an excel doc. The fan always runs like crazy and the fan is loud, I can't figure out what is going on in the background. I buy a lot of items from Amazon and I have never written a review, basically because I've always been satisfied, but not this time. I will never buy a PC/Laptop from Amazon again after this experience. I will buy it from somewhere I know exactly what I am getting, I can try it out and have it supported.",0
"really liked the computer. thin and lightweight. looks good. wifi adapter had to constantly be reset. based on other reviews, its something that HP should address. no problem returning via amazon",0
"La laptop tiene muy buen desempe?o, es rápida, el único pero que le pongo es que no trae puerto ethernet y el teclado es gris en condiciones de poca luz se batalla un poco para ver las letras, pero por lo demás esta bien, excelente Laptop.",0
"I really like how this computer runs, I haven't really had any issues with games I've played and they all run pretty smoothly. The screen is also really bright and the backlit keyboard is nice as well. Bluetooth works well and have not had any problems on that front.As far as issues go, the volume at it's highest is not very loud and after about 8 months of having it I started having touchpad problems which started as my touchpad not working for a minute to it stopping to work most of the time. If it weren't for the touchpad problem, I'd give it another star. I got it when it was $700 which I regret because I waited and it was $600 before that. Personally, I don't think the laptop is great for the price I paid and wouldn't pay more for it because aside from the touchpad problem, the space available (even though you can install more but that means paying more) and the sound quality makes it feel like it's cheaper than it was to purchase.",0
"This ultrabook laptop is definitely worth the money for a machine that is so powerful and lightweight. It has a super sturdy keyboard with a smooth touchpad. It opens and closes so smooth that it's indescribable and don't forget when opening it, the screen is at 100% sRGB (fancy scientific term for colors on the screen are extremely vivid and not washed out). When turning it on from sleep or hibernate mode, it comes back on in a split second. The speakers are loud enough that external speakers are not needed and decent in terms of quality - let's think for a second, Samsung is not going to put $500 top notch speakers into an affordable laptop - since there are laptops about the same price and the speakers are half as good. Plus, it has a headphone jack for a computer this slim! There's also 1 USB-A port so that not all ports are just USB-C (hint: Macbooks making you have to go buy several USB adapters).Now one of the cons of this laptop is it gets really hot at the bottom, so be careful if you like to put laptops on your lap. Another is the battery life is about only 5 hours when streaming video non-stop. Also, there are a lot of bloatware but they are non-intrusive so you don't need to actually get rid of them - do not get rid of the samsung updates and samsung settings apps though, they are the most useful. But the worst thing about this laptop is Windows 11! There's a compatibility problem with Firefox browser for whatever unknown reason and the bluetooth will disconnect at times. Had a previous a Acer laptop that was upgraded from Windows 10 to 11 and the damn thing shut off the bluetooth and all USB ports, kept thinking it was a hardware failure until downgraded it back to Windows 10 and everything was back to normal.But even with the cons, would still give this 5 stars. This rivals Macbooks that are just too damn expensive because this beauty's quality is just as good.",0
"I loved the laptop! The keyboard is soft, it is very light and thin, the charger was very practical, everything that I wanted. However the computer stopped working within 17 days of use. I was normally typing a text when the keyboard stopped working. Any button worked. Then I restarted the PC, but it was never turned on again. I put it on the charger to see if was a battery problem, but the lights indicating the charging process was off. Asus support told me that I could sent it to repair, but I preferred to return it anyway. It is really a bad sign when it has problems like this in less than one month of use. Amazon was really helpful to solve my problem.",0
"This laptop served me well for the time it lasted (a very short time!). From December 2017 to November 2018, the laptop worked fine until it suddenly died. It would not turn on no matter what I did. After I sent it in and waited around 3 months for a replacement (even though they said the average turnaround time is 7-10 days), I received my new laptop. It was actually a newer model with a touchscreen (hooray!, or so I thought)After only 4 months of use, the replacement laptop's screen died. I am writing from this laptop, although looking at a monitor plugged in via HDMI. Essentially, I need a desktop monitor or TV to be located wherever I am to use this laptop (kinda destroys the point of a laptop). I fear another component of this machine will break down, so I'll be replacing it with a new laptop from a different company. It definitely won't be another ASUS laptop for me.Stay away from these ASUS laptops! Although I will say the desktop computer GPUs and motherboards they make are significantly higher quality :)",0
"I really like this laptop for gaming and it handles most of my games pretty well. On my bigger games, the laptop heats up pretty quickly, however.",0
"the audio im guessing is decent......IF THE SPEAKERS WERENT POINTED DOWNWARD INTO MY LEGS while the laptop is in my lap. completely muffles the speakers. horrible design to point them downward. so now i have to cup my hands while lifting the laptop off my lap just to get some clarity when i watch ANYTHING! that and it has frozen up some on a 2000s pc game. age of empire 2. so its i3 processor isnt good at all. i would probably go with a different brand. i would have loved to give this back, but too late.",0
My son loved it!,0
This Core I3 laptop works perfectly for navigating in internet and using office 365.,0
"Love the computer and how it performers. However, my adult grandson showed me the computer he has and I automatically ordered it not realizing it was a computer for gamers. I wish I had chosen a Surface pro for the usage I need. Don't play games with players on line. The surface pro would have been better suited to my needs.",0
There is much to like about this computer but what I don't like is that it broke 35 day in and I never was offered an extended warranty when I purchased it. I bought it because my other new laptop broke (different brand and my fault). So I'm very disappointed.,0
Bought for our middle school aged son. Great for him and his use. Looks new and seems to be working great so far.,0
"Bought this laptop for my wife , she loves it",0
The ASUS laptop is the perfect size and weight for my needs. I'm sitting in bed typing this review and I can't be more pleased. The set up was a breeze. I use it for business and home. It is powerful enough for all my needs and extremely portable.,0
"I've had this laptop for about a year and its ok if its plugged in, but the battery life is terrible. It also gets really hot if you're using it while laying in bed or on on the couch. You can expect to get 2 hours of life with a full charge doing simple web browsing and even less the more you do. I do music production and will get 45 minutes of battery life with a full charge if I use FL Studio. If you are going for portability, this is an awful laptop. Stay away from it.",0
"to quickly summarize it... this thing is slow. bought it for my fiance, so she can do her online classes on the go. its so slow and frustrating that she just waits to get home and use the desktop. lol. oh well.",0
"I could not afford a new MacBook at the time so I was looking for a new laptop for my job, school, and some mild gaming. So far this does the trick. Fast with videos, files, and emails. Gaming it seems to work pretty well. I haven't played any new games like Destiny 2 or COD. Mostly older games off of steam like RTS games. It does heat up when I play games and the fan really starts to run pretty hard. But what do you expect when playing games on a laptop. The only issue I have is the battery life. It last about 5 hours just doing documents editing or emails. Videos or playing videogames it last probably 3 hours. I did get a dead pixel within the first few weeks. It's on the far left but still for the price I paid you would hope that wouldn't happen for a while. Not a fan at all of the track pad, but then again I am used to MacBooks track pad which is the best I've used.With all that being said, I recommend this laptop for business, school and someone who wants to do some mild gaming off of Steam.",0
"Whenever I watched a movie, the sound didn't come out right. The screen was not good and the soundtrack was awful.",0
Great Laptop!,0
The screen is so crisp and the viewing angles are so good the touchscreen is very responsive,0
Good for what I need,0
"Can't see video on my directv app, can't use my cbs all access or netlix. Games are ok. I should have just bought a tablet. Would have been happier",0
"My first Chromebook, I wanted to switch because my tablets are all Android. The learning curve was steep because I was making it harder than it needed to be. Entry level but is perfect for my needs. You can find things to nit pic but I am Happy. 2nd Lenovo, the other is my 7"" tablet...A month now and still happy..",0
"I use this Chromebook for basic internet surfing. Sadly it is the slowest new computer I've ever bought, which is super frustrating because I bought it to replace a slow Windows PC. I wish I had returned it within the window to do so. On the positive side, it looks good, has a nice big screen, and starts up quickly.",0
"The Keyboard is very clicky, and mechanical.",0
"This product has never held a charge from the get-go. I contacted Amazon, and they talked me into getting a different charger. I had surgery right about then and missed the deadline for returning due to surgery recovery (I coudnt drive to get it to post office). I still use it, but have to limit time to 15 minute because with the charger plugged in ALL the time, it overheats. Awful, awful Chromebook!",0
I purchased this laptop to work remotely. The batter life is not good.,0
"The Chromebook itself seems great but then after 13 months, after the warranty expired the mouse pad no longer was useable. Luckily I bought the Asurion plan so I was thankful I did. They received the Chromebook and told me it would be 10 days, which was fine. I then received a phone call from a Robert saying unfortunately they had to order the part it would be in on Sept. 20th, 2020. They would then next day it to us. Still fine. Well I then receive an email on August 28th saying they were sorry the Chromebook could not be fixed they will return our money. They didn't even have the part yet? So did they try to even fix it? We paid $227 a year ago. I think honestly they are keeping it to fix and resale for the crazy $400 and above price. Completely unacceptable. Will never but Asurion again or a Chromebook from Amazon. Yes, I called several times to get answers, I'm actually sitting on hold right now for the 10th time so far it's been 31 minutes! They are impossible to get a hold of. Just talk to a Cindy and apparently Hp is no longer making the replacement part! Not sure why they are still selling this product, if thats the case.",0
Best laptop I've ever had. Boots up and shuts down in literally like 12 seconds. Looks cool. Lightweight. Screen doesn't have a great viewing angle. Can glare easily but your just hasn't to adjust screen. Not going to be a gaming computer but can run your normal programs for work and access websites with no problem.,0
"I have two of the previous Samsung entry level Chromebooks, both of which have become slower over time. They have been optimally tuned. After much reading, and the running of the OCTANE benchmarks, I became convinced that the growth of the web and heavy ""paging"" had to be countered by faster processing. I selected this Chromebook based on it's benchmark performance of about 4x my existing devices. Would I be rewarded accordingly? OH YEAH! This thing flys. Those ugly, slow, ""lists"" on yahoo that would drive you nuts? This unit screen paints the next one immediately. If your performance is annoyingly slow, and you have tuned as best you can with no results, if you have adequate network speed, then this unit will deliver. Also includes hi res HD display, touchscreen, and a stylus. Go for it!",0
"Runs quality games. Two issues I have been having: 1. keys getting stuck (mostly number keys) and 2. fan occasionally gets rather loud. Neither is a serious hindrance- the fan is not so loud that it interferes with chatting over a mike or anything like that. The stuck keys just sometimes require you to press down again with a little gentle assistance.I've seen at least one customer noting similar issues, so it's probably a consistent design flaw.The high quality graphics are amazing, and the 4.1 Ghz processor is a treat as well.",0
When I opened the lid to this laptop it got caught on a small piece of black plastic in between both hinges and got stuck while trying to lift open the lid. Even though it was a certified refurbished item sold by amazon I was expecting the laptop to still come without an issue as basic as this wrong with it.,0
"The notebook itself wors fine, for personal use it`s ok, but it came with broken screen and couldn`t return it",0
Excellent!,0
"Soy de Ecuador y al inicio estaba un poco dudoso de importar la laptop a mi país o no, al final lo hice con miedo por los malos comentarios que tenían estas laptos en sus versiones pasadas y por lo dificultoso que sería para mi tramitar una garantía. Pero sin duda esta portátil tiene un buen desempe?o:Para trabajos cotidianos esta sobrada.Para juegos si nos subes todo al máximo o si lo haces pero juegas a 1080p, no da problemas en lo absoluto.Contras que en lo personal veo:Cuando estas realizando algo pesado, el cpu suele subir a los 90 grados, si tienes configurado que los ventiladores no suban a su máxima capacidad.Eso por consiguiente hace que caliente mucho la parte de arriba del teclado, pero no es nada que no hagan otras portátiles.Cuando los ventiladores suben por arriba de los 4000rpm el sonido de las elices es un poco fuerte.Y por último la autonomía de la batería conectado un monitor secundario viendo videos o series en Netflix o Amazon suele estar por las 4 horasNo es perfecta pero ronda en un 85%",0
"After a lot of research of other laptops, this one seemed to fit my needs which were basically light weight, fast, adequate memory and the right size for me. This fits the bill. I use it for accessing my other laptop by remote server so that I can work wherever a connection is available and also searching on this one for genealogy purposes. Delivery was as promised and I am happy with it. Would recommend it.",0
"Recomiendo al vendedor al100% ya que se responsabiliza al 100% de cualquier tipo de cargo realizado en aduana(como lo indica en su perfil) precios no exagerados y accesibles, muy contento con el producto y con el tiempo de entrega a pesar de ser un envío internacional",0
This is a very useful machine. I do some 3D printing and the extra horsepower runs circles around my old i5 laptop. It games ..OK. My old i7 desktop with a GTX 1060 outperforms this 3060 by a large margin.My biggest complaint is the speakers. In this day and age how do they justify such tinny baseless underperforming speakers? My 2 year old cell phone sounds better! Do better Asus. Complaints aside. My compute-intensive tasks run like a dream. That was the reason I purchased this machine to begin with. And some light gaming on the side is a bonus.,0
"I Got My Laptop With A Defective Battery , Acer Refused To Send Me A Replace , Highly Not Recommended",0
"Overall, it is great for any college student looking for a small, compact laptop that gets the job done. It is extremely useful for running several programs at once and multitasking (ie. Microsoft Office programs, different websites, statistical software). However, I have noticed that the battery life isn’t the best, especially when compared to my other laptop with similar specs, and the fan tends to be loud when performing larger tasks.Besides that, I honestly love it. It is lightweight and does what it needs to well; I’m happy with my purchase.",0
Shipped quickly- seems just as advertised. So much better than the last one I had ! Can't say much more than that-haven't had it long enough -but so far so good !,0
"the terrible USB port locations. 2 ports on the mouse side, directly in the middle, and then just one USB on the left side",0
"Great gaming laptop. Only bad thing about this laptop it's his battery, about 4hrs of working time.",0
it only comes with 16gb single channel ram and cause of that fps in manu games are lower than expected around (10-20 fps) low,0
"Our child is using this laptop for schoolwork which is primarily online work with some local activities (some programming software, picture cropping/editing) done on the computer itself.The specifications - processor, 8GB Ram, 256GB SSD - are very good and somewhat expected at this price point. The computer is responsive and capable and we have no complaints with it's performance. It is not a gaming laptop or something to use for editing a movie, but you can do just about everything you want with it.The screen is a matt finish and a bit dull. It doesn't really ""pop"" in any way. It's fine and functional but not going to win anyone over. 15"" makes for a larger laptop than needed - a 14"" or 13.5"" might be a better fit if portability is important. The case, which is plastic and textured, feels a bit cheap and show fingerprints readily. It's fine - nothing ugly - but not ""wow"".The trackpad is decent. It might take a little getting used to, but we found it reliable. For fine work you might want a mouse. It isn't top-of-the-line, but fully functional. The keyboard is comfortable but it is frustrating at times that it does not light up. At this price point the keyboard should be lit.This is a good computer - above the cheap entry level ones that are frustrating for performance and quality, but below the premium computers you might have to spend significantly more for. As such, it works nicely as an entry-level computer for a student or in a workshop.",0
"The battery life is very poor and an upgraded battery and additional RAM upgrade is more than buying a better laptop to begin with. I am not a gamer, however I do use photo editing and drawing tablets, and the battery gets drained in one hour or less. I also run DirectRip (for textile printing) and need to use the laptop plugged in at all times.The build quality is great and I like the keyboard. It isn't bad for the price, if you are not using it for gaming or needing to use unplugged for long.",0
"The keyboard is also well designed, making input a positive strength of this device.",0
I've had this computer for about 6 months now and have no complaints. Everything works great,0
Damaged out of the box. Will be returning!,0
"I bought this laptop for university school and let me tell you...it could take jamming! Battery life is long lasting i must add and the graphics quality is exceptional. I have absolutely no issues with this laptop. In fact, i will be buying one for my son for his birthday! Definitely recommend.",0
Love it so far and very fast. Fast shipping too,0
The laptop had some tiny issues with the screen brightness and the fingerprint reader since the first day. It didn't really bother me until out of nowhere the screen turned off and stopped working after only 2 months of use. I tried taking it to Acer to repair it with the warranty but as it turns out I could only go to Acer in USA and I had moved to Europe so it was not an option. I ended up paying to repair it and it's still failing sometimes for different issues. This is honestly the worst computer I've ever had.,0
For a new computer it can be slow at times and i had a few hiccups starting up already and the printer is not even 4 months old,0
"For those of us who used to type on IBM Selectric typewriters the feel of a keyboard is important; this one feels really good. It is also quite a bit faster than a 2-3 year old chromebook it replaced. It's no replacement for a Windows computer where one need a Microsoft Office Suite, but for web search and viewing, it's blazingly fast. FOR $180 you can't go wrong.",0

My old laptop was barely booting up so did some research. This laptop rated high in all points for my needs.,0
"The Laptop was fine up until the end of first month from purchase, when the laptop got dead pixel. So, I called the Lenovo premium care to rectify the issue, they said they wanted me to take the machine to Best Buy to see/confirm the issue with Geek Squad before they could take action. I got the Geek Squads written report confirming what I said to Lenovo. So, I call the customer care again with this confirmation and the agent wanted to again see the issue via video and I agreed and then he issued an onsite warranty repair to replace the LCD Panel. The first technician came and replaced the LCD but he broke the Bezel in the process and then he arranged for a second repair to replace the bezel. (The second technician did not arrive in the said date and I had to call in to find out on when it would happen – no proper communication) A week later the second technician came and he in the process of replacing the bezel cracked the screen. Then the second technician arranged for a third service. A week later the third technician came to replace the screen but the screen did not match the laptop and so it would not work and also he did not put back the bezel back properly. The third technician arranged for a fourth service. The next day I called Lenovo premium care and I delayed the service for a week. After this deferred week I called Lenovo to know when they would arrive and they said it will a take a further week – there was no communication here again and I had to call in to find out. By now the Laptop was having issues for a month with multiple failed onsite repair and lack of communication for a Laptop that was past the two-month mark.So, I called Lenovo premium care for a refund, they said only the customer relationship agent (another department) can do it and that they will mail or call me about it. Later that day I get a mail saying that they will fix it in a week (which is nothing new and is not the communication expectation set). The next day I call the Lenovo number for return for a refund and I said the whole scenario and they asked me for the order number so they can refund. Since the order was through Amazon, they say they cannot process the refund. I called Amazon for the refund due to the scenario and they put me through Lenovo (not clear why) and this time the Lenovo agent said they cannot replace the machine or issue the refund and only do a warranty repair, going on and on about their policy in spite of repeated bad service for a new product. Again, I called Amazon customer service and they said they can take the Laptop back but for a 20% restocking fees as it is outside the 30 day period. I said I am asking for a refund for the issue of the manufacturer and because I purchased to through Amazon so the refund can be done through Amazon (as mentioned by Lenovo). Then the Amazon agent was repeating their policy and their internal process. I said the responsibility should stop somewhere and I cannot spend any more time going back and forth repeating this issue on each phone call and asked to get Lenovo also on the call as I cannot waste any more time due to this issue and the call wait took a long time to get a Lenovo representative online, after some time of hold the Amazon representative said they will contact me in an hour. Then the Amazon representative called me a said they will process the full refund. Relieved!If you happen to a get an issue with the laptop, good luck with customer service and resolution for an otherwise good laptop. Some of my cons for the laptop based on my experience:1. The UEFI screen cannot be accessed via external display if the laptop display is not working/available.2. The laptop has poor reparability if not then the repair service is bad.3. Web cam quality is bad4. CPU is not cooled well.Pros:1. Good port selection and placement2. The display in this model has good image quality3. Subjective: No RGB and not fancy looking and is functional4. Good Keyboard5. GPU is cooled wellP.S: When calling a Lenovo representative the call message till you get connected, touts you to take the onsite warranty so you have less downtime. Guess the word down time is very flexible as you see here.",0
"I bought this saying it’s good for school being that I am a teacher can make my lessons plan and use PowerPoint to create lessons. So far so good the soft ware was blocked I YouTubed and unlocked it out of Smode so for me it’s fine and got the job done!I recently started noticing that my laptop overheats for no reason. As once I turn it on and I put it down for 15 -20 mins. The entire laptop overheats. And once that happens that’s it for some time I have to wait until it catches itself and then proceed with whatever I was doing before.I mean I expect something to go wrong but I have had it since July 2021 and it’s March 2022 and from January I noticed the overheating. And trust me I don’t charge it too often.All in all, I am preparing my mind to know I have to start looking for a new laptop soon. Because this one is definitely going to give up on me by July 2022.I like the laptop tough wish I had gotten a better one.",0

"I bought this Chromebook for my boss who has almost no computer experience, but I've finally got him at least checking his email.This snazzy little machine is great for anyone who primarily wants access to the internet and Google services. It's fast and has a lot of versatility but getting it to pair with a printer is a bear. It couldn't see our older model Canon deskjet at all, wired or wireless. It apparently has something to do with the operating system Chrome uses. (I am strictly an end user myself, but not a complete novice.)A little online research told us that HP printers were more amenable to Chromebook, so we ordered a little HP (your welcome, Amazon). I was finally able to get the Chromebook to recognize the HP when wired, but not wireless. Both Chromebook and HP help was cumbersome and ultimately useless.I really wanted to love this Chromebook and had great hopes for it. I'm still impressed with what it does offer, but something as simple as pairing it with a printer should not be such an issue.",0
Product came to me like new. Have been using it since I bought it and it is doing the job I needed it to do. I use it for work and it works well. Literally everything works well. Disregard my blue post it note covering the web cam. No complaints and it’s been a couple weeks now? That I have been using it literally every day for work. I have until December to return it but I don’t think I will be returning it. 🙏🏽🙏🏽Thanks Amazon refurbishing dept for this deal.,0
"For the price, one of the best you can get. Fans are loud, my screen has some backlight bleed and the power block on the cord is huge.

"This is gonna be short and sweet. It hasn’t given me any issues while gaming, producing music, and just surfing the web. The processor is definitely a step up from what I have and I plan to keep it here. The only CON I have is that when you unplug this guy gaming is not the way to go. Keep it plugged in for the best results while you’re gaming. Everything else works as normal but gaming lacks as soon as you hit about 30% 40%It fits perfectly with on my set up which is constantly growing as it is. It is kinda hefty for a laptop but I kinda like it. Big laptops need love too Craig. Hope this helps",0

My friends and I got this computer for school and we all had the problem that during our online classes the computer would start freezing and say ""high CPU usage"".

"I recently migrated to Apple after many years using a wide variety of PCs running Windows or Linux. I decided to make that move after Apple's introduction of the M1 processor, which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform. Now. of course, the M2 has been released, but, depending on your needs, the 2020 Macbook Air with the M1 will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware. You can search the Internet for professional reviews of the Macbook Air, but I feel confident you'll find plenty to verify what I'm saying.The Retina display is beautiful. The sound system is superior to any other laptop I have owned or used. The battery holds up all day under typical use, and I can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off. The Apple OS (Monterey) is smooth and fast, and I was able to learn my way around in it quickly. When you need help, a Google search will yield tons of tips quickly, or you can avail yourself of Apple support.I will say that the Air is a little short on USB ports, lacks a built-in card slot, and, of course, is not equipped with a touchscreen. However, I have run a USB hub from one of the two Thunderbolt ports, and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readers...even a portable DVD-burner. As far as a touchscreen goes, I have that on a Dell laptop I run Linux on, but I never use it...guess I'm a mouse or touchpad guy.The aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished, the keyboard has a very nice touch, the battery seems to charge quickly, and the Air is light at under 3 lbs.One last thing! I have been a heavy user of both Google and Microsoft services, and I have found that Apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the Mac environment. I run Google's Backup and Sync and Microsoft's OneDrive with no problems. My AVG subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both Mac OS and Windows machines.I have no regrets for this purchase. Actually, the Air was my 3rd M1 Mac. I also have an iMac and a Mac Mini. They all work together very well!",0
"It is a very good cheap, light, and fast laptop. It is very suitable for my kind of work. I just recommend it.",0
I watched videos that talked about how good the keyboard feels. They were right. Replaced my macbook air with this X1 Carbon. Using it for work and personal use. Very happy,0

"I had a few years old Asus UX305F (Core M processor) that I was happy with until it got a large glass of water down the keyboard. I looked at others but the lightweight Asus still fit my needs best. Almost identical except that the speakers on the new model are much louder and it has the backlit keyboard. Other than that it still has the combo page/line keys which require you to use two hands to hit the function key to activate the page function - I'd prefer separate keys but you get used to it. The fan is very quite, barely noticeable when it does come on. The 8th gen Core I5 is zippier than the core M processor in my old one and it certainly has enough power for all of the average user's needs.",0

"Update:The high pitched coil noise the fans make is super annoying. I don't know if mine is special, but it's ridiculous. I really should have sent this back and gotten a prebuilt desktop. Acer. Fix your fans!Original second review:My previous review got deleted somehow. It was very thorough on the pros and cons of this laptop. Short version.CPU gets too hot. Thermal throttles when gaming. It's not constant throttling but periodically the temperature peaks for a second then returns to a more normal range. The new Acer 1.06 bios helped a little. Instead of reaching 212 or more degrees F, it mostly reaches 203 degrees F.The Acer customer service link they give you on a card in the box does not actually work.The fans make a very slight coil whine like noise. Most people probably won't notice, But I do.I got this because of the graphics card drought.",0
Buen bien. El producto,0
Havent had this chromebook very long. Easy set up and my daughter seems happy with it. Compared to her old one it seems kind of cheaply made but time will tell. Happy so far.,0
"This little computer is lightweight, quick and easy to set up. It does everything I need and I love it.",0
"The screen is shocking. Poor in good light never mind direct day light. It freezes and is clunky as a browser and the sound is poor and tiny, so you need to have external speakers and view the screen from a specific angle to get a mediocre viewing experience.Just as a web browser it is difficult to read from the screen. It also came with a US plug and no option from amazon to select another mind you the delivery address should provide a clue!The single worst purchase I've ever made and i own a tight jock strap.",0
"After updating all the systems software on the computer and using it for a few weeks it still runs as expected and very well at gaming, typing, and student task. I would highly recommend this item to others because the value to performance factor is great on this laptop.",0
"The sleek aesthetics of this computer are impressive, but the hinges feel a bit flimsy. My dream would be to have a liquid metal hinge that adjusts to any angle while maintaining a sturdy and firm hold.",1
Great size. Good quality! easy to set up and use.,0
"Pour un ordinateur portable qui n'est pas un ordinateur de gaming, on ne peut pas demander mieux. L'ordinateur démarre rapidement et peut rouler Windows 10 et naviguer sur Internet et jouer des vidéos sans problème. La fonctionnalité wifi intégré capte bien le signal. La durée de vie de la batterie est moyenne, mais elle se recharge vite au moins. L'ordinateur peut rouler des vieux jeux comme Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 ou Rainbow Six Vegas 2, mais pas les jeux récents.",0
If you have a student that uses cloud-based apps. This is a great buy. Consider an external hard drive for storage but it is a good machine for the money.,0
I bought this laptop for school and was looking for a computer within the budget for a college student. Well I found one and I can tell you why it’s so cheap- because it is trash in the disguise of a laptop. From the beginning set up was terribly slow. I am returning it.,0
"I'm coming from a 2008 Sony Vaio so this was a major upgrade. I only use it for programming and it's lightning fast, having SSD really helps. It looks premium and I have no problems with build, also keyboard flex is not an issue nor is the power button placement. I definitely recommend for the price, you can't beat it.I bought this in May 2018 and I have to replace the battery, pretty short lifespan but I am sure the average battery for this computer will last longer. -1 star.",0
"The only thing I don't like about my new Acer Chromebook is that it doesn't have a CAPS LOCK key. I keep hitting the key that is CAPS LOCK on other laptops and computers and it takes me to the menu. Very frustrating when I'm in the middle of writing and I need to write a long word or phrase in all capital letters. Other than that, it is a great laptop and I enjoy it very much.",0
"This is a nice computer. It has a touchpad issue, sometimes doed not respond. Everything else is good,",0
"This M1 replaces a 2015 MacBook Air. It's actually the second M1 Air in our family (I bought a refurbished one earlier this year to replace a retiring 2012 Air), and at $799 for the 8 GB RAM / 256 GB SSD model is an insanely great value.Some of the other recent reviews mentioned a musty odor and speculated these had been in storage or previously used. There was a slight musty or chemical odor when the box was opened, but upon checking carefully I found the smell originated from the included printed materials, NOT the computer itself or the packaging. There was absolutely no sign of mold, moisture, or dampness in the box, the sealed packaging, or the laptop.Installing and running a utility showed this Air was assembled in August 2022 and had so far logged no battery cycles. It's a new M1 Air, not old stock. (The 2020 date in the description is the year the M1 Air model was introduced, not when this computer was made.)",0

"So I worked at Best Buy for like a year as a computer sales rep. It was my job to figure out what machine worked to who based on the things they wanted to achieve.Having this laptop about a week in, I have to say this little thing is amazing. It has its response issues, it's a Celeron. I didn't say it could do anything. You won't game or edit videos, you'll struggle using photoshop or even playing Minecraft I'm sure. But everyone could make use of a laptop like this. It's small, light, quick, the trackpad and keyboard are high quality (what you would expect from Asus).No one doesn't browse the internet or type things out, and for those things it's perfect. Paired with the ability to upgrade the storage indefinitely with a micro SD card or use cloud storage? Super powerful machine for the price. For comparison, I also have a $1,500 ROG from 2018 and a MacBook Pro with the TouchBar, I have a few desktops, and ultimately I can still find use from this little guy.10/10 would buy again. Actually, I might too.",0
Everything I expected,0
Excelente opción de gama media. Satisfecho con la compra,0
Bought as a gift for my wife. She loves it.,0
the keyboard gets a bit uncomfortable to the touch,0
This is a great little laptop! Everyone is talking about how slow it is but I was playing music on Spotify while also surfing the web and downloading two apps in the background and it still loaded websites very quickly! Over all 10/10 would buy again no need for an expensive laptop. The build quality is another good part of it. While it is all plastic it feels really nice even though it is lightweight. I don’t know if it would survive a drop or not but it feels pretty sturdy. The screen quality is good too. The one con I can think of is the fact that it comes with windows 10s but it only took a quick google search and about 5 minutes to change it back to normal windows. Also with a one year subscription to office 365 you are basically getting this for $55. ($155 when I bought it)If I have any future problems I’ll try to update this review and let you know:)Also sorry for weird writing style I don’t really know how to make a review flow well.,0
I received the package last night in San Diego and after charge it for over 3hours and try to turn it on the screen was blank meanwhile the keyboard light was on,0
Good little machine,0
Its sleek black and copper accents made it subtle but clean looking and while it has the power of a gaming laptop I can confidently bring this into meetings without looking like Im a washed out e-sports player with an alienware.,0
"No touch screenBig Liedo not purchase if you need a touch screenother than it works as advertised.I want my money back.But I need the thing on a daily basis, as I am an OnLine College Instructor.",0
This thing packs a serious punch. It has handled everything I've thrown at it without issue. I honestly have no complaints at all.If I absolutely had to choose something it'd be the battery life. It lasts maybe 2-3 hours even with the system just sitting idle. Personally not an issue with me because anywhere I plan to use it there is an available outlet to plug into.Other than that everything is great.,0
I LOVE IT!!!! I LOVE THAT I CAN USE AS A TABLET/LAPTOP/PHONE/PORTABLE MOVIE THEATER!!!! I AM HAAAPPY WITH IT!!!!!,0
i have been able to download and use the apps i want,0
A good price for a great product. Perfect for my needs. K,0
This computer can run pretty much any game at a good and steady frame rate. It’s performance is unbelievable! It does tend to get really hot but that’s only if it’s used for long periods of time. Overall great computer I would recommend it to anyone thinking about buying it.,0
Awesome machine!!!,0
"I’ve had this laptop for a few months now and it’s still working as perfectly as it did out of the box. I’m a more casual gamer (Sims 4, etc), but it has taken every game I’ve thrown at it with ease. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a gaming laptop on a budget.",0
Cumple con las expectativas,0
I bought two laptops and planning to buy more during Christmas sale..,0
It good,0
"--almost 3 weeks usage--Great for Work / Mail / Internet ""stuff"" / Study tasks.Fast boot, bright image.Strong build. I didn't like the Camera.The sound is excellent, very good speakers (but nobody uses them..)Keyboard is ok, Track pad ok too.I've not tried playing games.. I have no opinion about it..It has 4 cores and 8 threads.. really wasn't expecting that..I should have read the specifications first..I use Hangout and Skype a lot, If camera was better I'd give five stars",0
"Beautiful. Fast, lightweight. Does what it should do.",0
This is a great deal & fantastic quality!,0
First look the laptop is solid,0
"Works really well for playing games and what not. The only problem i have is that the track pad is useless. Extremely useless, so don't plan on using it AT ALL!!!!!!",0
The keyboard and power cord are much improved from the older MacAir versions. Excellent device!,0
Use this laptop for work-no touchscreen-speed and battery life exceed my needs-ACER brand has not let me down yet and this is my 3rd one-definitely recommend the brand,0
The speaker grills are STICKERS.,0
"Like the updated M1 processor. Like the extra memory. Don't like the ""Left outs"". No lighted apple logo on the cover. It was replaced by a mirror like decal. (Cheap) Don't like the lack of ports. No HCMI, no SDHC memory slot for you camera memory chip, you need to buy adaptor for USBC and there are only 2 on the left none on the right only a 3.5 mm audio jack. In addition when charging the unit there is no indication, no light no sound, nothing that lets you know it is charging.Cheap, cheap cheap....shame on you Apple.",0
This is a great little laptop! I needed something just for college work and so far so good! No issues yet!,0
It is nice,0
As soon as I unboxed it got a good hour of screen time then kapoof it goes dead. Acer products always do this,0
A very nice laptop that surpassed my expectations in build quality with it's light weight. This 7th gen i3 processor performance is a noticeable improvement over my older 4th gen i3 4005u. It handles everyday task with ease and does great in light casual gaming for Minecraft even being able to handle GTA Online on low. Only issue I've found is the left click button has gone really soft only after some light use which is not a big deal since I mainly use a mouse. A great buy and recommended!,0

I bought this laptop to upgrade from a desktop Ryzen 5 and 1660 to a Ryzen 9 and 3080. It was a great deal for the money and was great at first. Then it came time to upgrade to Windows 11 and had to restart. As you can see in the video it’s been restarting nonstop and basically broken on Day 1. If someone could help or knows what’s wrong with it or Asus reach out it would be greatly appreciated.,0

"Après quelques jours d'utilisation, le clavier a ''gelé''', et impossible de le remettre en fonction. J'ai installé un clavier externe et fait des recherches sur le web. Après plusieurs heures d'essais, j'ai du retourner l'ordinateur.",0
This laptop has been amazing to game with. It handles everything I throw at it on the highest setting. The laptop handles well both plugged in and unplugged with the only drawback being the amount of noise the fan might produce. The noise has not been an issue as I only use headphones but others in the room will definitely notice. The RGB illuminated keys are nice and the built in software to customize the colors and bindings are a great addition too. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking at this price range.,0
"I'm a 40 year old mom who wanted a small laptop for writing, and that's exactly what I got. It's perfect for my needs, small, light, and has decent battery life. I use it for streaming shows and movies, and browsing Pinterest, Instagram, and Twitter, and it also works perfect. My only complaint is the screen resolution gets pixelated when I try to zoom in when watching shows. I wouldn't think it's a good gaming computer, because if it was my 12 year old son would be begging to use it everyday. But, he doesn't, and I get it all to myself. If you want it for the basics, get this Chromebook, it's a good one.",0
Works as described,0
"This laptop is fantastic. The user interface is easy, and the speed is incredible. My favorite thing about this laptop is the keyboard. The keys make typing SO SMOOTH and quick. It’s a bit heavier than I expected, but this is likely because of the DVD drive. It is still lightweight for a 15” laptop. I would recommend.",0
We received the computer in only 2 days--WOW! I like the fact that it was easy to set up. I dislike the face that the print on it is so small that it is very difficult to read. Have not had time to explore all the features yet.,0
When you plug in the charger there is a static sound coming from the laptop,0
"Arrived on time. The product is worth the price except for one small problem ( in my opinion) which is the battery life. It doesn't say on the description the battery life and I thought since it's new, it should be 10+ hrs but it's 8 hours and I feel like it runs out really quick.",0
"Rapida, y no se friza, Me encanta!",0

"Needless to say, I love my Macbook Air. This is the first time I purchased a laptop that's apple. I have owned one in the past, but it felt good actually purchasing my own this time. Now I not only have an Ipad, Apple Watch, Apple phone but I now have an Apple Macbook Air.",0
GPU is dead and not being recognized a month after purchase.,0

"Smooth and crazy fast, used on and off for 4 days and battery still at 40%. What a beautiful machine!",0
"This was a great purchase. It had a few minor external flaws, but works like a charm. Charger cord was included. The battery life was very poor, but the seller replaced the battery as soon as I reported it. Overall, very satisfied.",0
I am a youtuber and I would like to review your productMy YouTube channel is Itz Tenzin,0
"2 stars is ""I don't like it"", which is true. Its cheaply made. My first one had a issue with the sound, couldn't hear from internal speaker or through headphones. With this one, the frame for the screen has peeled off from the screen so now I gotta glue it together. Another issue is it sounds like there is a wire that is loose and is being hit by the fan. Also, it often runs very hot with just a browser open or Netflix running. I have to operate a Linux partition to avoid that last issue but there are somethings I must use Windows for. This is sad because my last Asus laptop was less expensive but ran much better than this. Best thing about this thing is the long battery life and nice display, but overall it's not worth it.",0
Linda,0
This laptop it’s good.It can hold a lot of games with graphic .But it’s battery it’s the shortcoming. _(:τ」∠)_ you can play for no more than 3 hours in power saving mode.But watching or studying it’s fine.Anyway I like this laptop.(??????)??,0
MSI support is useless and didn't help or force them to drive many hours away to the nearest physical support center.,0
"Excellent gaming and desktop app performance - e.g. Ghost Recon Breakpoint ""Ultra"" graphics gets 80-90 fps - runs @ 80c! - Large AutoCAD & Revit projects manipulation - no problemo!",0
"so we had to return it.... it was returned without difficulties. It had no drive to install programs, no ethernet jack for wired internet/network use. Logging on required a Microsoft account. All these contributed to the necessity of returning it.",0
"Pretty peeved over receiving, what looks like a returned laptop. The seal was open and the box looked damaged.",0
"For a Chromebook... this is GREAT! Understand, this is a Chromebook... but I did get a 256GB micro SD card to expand the storage space... that works great too. My son loves it since he uses an X box for gaming and his phone for most other things... this fits the bill for that in-between technology that he was missing - a place to type up things (office business/school), emails, web-browsing, and applications that are familiar to someone that uses a Samsung S10 phone (Android). The OS is Android so remember that... not Windows (for the novice techie). Samsung as a real winner here.",0
"I recently purchased this and have only had it a few days. I already have a nice desktop workstation that I purchased in 2018 for computer graphics and animation work. I do some gaming, but not really my reason for purchase. I needed a laptop with similar performance so that I could travel and work away from home. I needed the largest screen available, which is 17.3, and also a good amount of ram with a good video card. I finally chose this Sager for it's good value and it seemed to check off the boxes for a strong package. 17 inch screen, 32g ram, RTX 2060 6bm graphics card and I got the 2 -1TB SSD card option for a bit more money. I paid extra for the faster shipping and received it within 3 days. It feels like a solid laptop and good quality. The keyboard feels high quality and the buttons have good feedback and solid feel. I use a usb wireless mouse so I can not say much about the mouse pad function on the laptop, but it seems very good and I like the feel of the left/right mousepad function keys on the laptop. After the usual windows 10 bootup steps it was up and running nicely. Took me a while to get it loaded with all my work programs, but seems really fast and comparable to my desktop workstation speed. I am now able to work on some computer animation projects away from home and travel if needed. I did also buy a laptop cooling pad with fans. I did try out ""The Witcher 3"" pc game with full graphics and the laptop definitely switches on the fans and heats up. The cooling pad is an extra layer of peace of mind to keep things a bit cooler, but maybe not totally necessary. If you play games a lot, then get a cooling pad. For my work the fans do not kick in that open, except for when I need to playback larger scenes in real time. Over all I am happy with my purchase so far and the speed and quality seems good. Reliability remains to be seen with more time under the belt, but hoping for the best.",0
"Great laptop, plenty fast for home recording with no latency. I've had it for about 6 months now with absolutely no issues.",0
"......such as Backlit keyboard, Laptop/tablet in one, Fingerprint security, Touch screen and so much more for under a grand. It took me hours to find a machine with everything I wanted for less than 1K, but Im glad I kept searching because this is IT.",0
Not best for gaming but amazing laptop.,0
"Excelente equipo, buen rendimiento y ligero. Las bocinas tienen una buena calidad de sonido. Considerar que el teclado esta en ingles y no trae la letra Ñ. Por otro lado al teclado le falta un indicador de la activación de la tecla Caps Lock (Mayusculas), así como de la tecla Num Lk (Número). En el mismo sentido al pad numérico le falta la tecla Enter provocando una incomodidad al trabajar ingresando números y tener que dar el Enter al lado izquierdo.Para trabajos básicos de oficina tiene un buen rendimiento y muy rápido. Lo recomiendo.",0
Love this unit. Perfect size,0
"Produit de qualité correct sans plus. Il n'y a pas de clic droit d'intégré, pas d'ecran tactile et ça ne semble pas être une version très récente du Chrome OS. Peut toujours être utile mais ne pensez pas l'utiliser comme appareil principal. En revanche, les apps comme Facebook, Netflix, YouTube et Tou.tv fonctionnement bien.",0
Comes with lots of bloatware,0
"Been using heavily for a month now. Great processor, probably more than you need for a chromebook. Looks and feels Great. Highly recommended.",0
Quiet as promised; my previous laptop was much more noisy but this Acer is a pleasure to use. The only thing I don't like is that when the screen is dark you can notice backlights at the edges. But it happens when the screen is completely dark so it's not a big deal.,0
"Besides the bloatware, having to convert to real Windows 10, having a possibly refurbished product advertised as new, webcam lens falling out and no 5Ghz WiFi connectivity its a decent laptop for the price.Specs are decent but outdated.The seller was Best Electronics, which after my research, is a Chinese refurbishment company but Amazon advertised as new.",0
No complaints,0
"As the headline leads on, I bought the 12th Gen i7 version RTX 3070 of the Pulse GL66. It DOES NOT have a 2.5 inch space or slot. It does however has a second NVME slot for storage next to the battery plug when you open it up; please buy a NVME if you plan to expand storage. It may not read the first time. Look for guides online for command prompt and diskpart for the laptop to read the extra NVME. (: Otherwise, it's a great laptop I managed to get a a bargain. Step up from my i7 8th gen GTX 1060 laptop I've had for a few years.",0
fast to boot up. fast with multiple windows open. wonderful screen with sharp resolution. great sound bar speakers with one button to push to raise/lower/mute volume (most other brands you have to push two buttons at once - Fn + another button. A great price for a great laptop. I would highly recommend this product.,0
"Within two hours of unboxing and setting it up it started having issues with crashing and the BSOD. After spending 8+ hours on three separate calls to both Dell and Microsoft to fix my brand new laptop with no resolution for a repair, I had no choice but to return it. My issues may be isolated with this particular laptop, but I didn’t want to chance it with a replacement.",0
"I got this laptop as a backup after Apple told me my minor screen issue with my macbook would be $800...After using it for a few weeks now, here are my thoughts.PROS- The charger is small and not a huge block that takes up both outlets.- The price- The keyboard, feels nice to type on and backlit- Fingerprint accessCONS- Washed out screen quality, but tolerable.- The speakers are WAY too quiet. They're fine for headphones if set up to 100 but if you're going to try to watch videos/movies/netflix on it, forget it.- Touchpad is way too sensitive. Even as you're moving your cursor around, it can set off a click and bring you somewhere you didnt want to go.- The right side number pad. Unnecessary and puts everything else off-center.- Battery life is about 3-4 hours",0
"So far, I love the quick response time, fast wake up, and overall quality. I haven't done much with gaming, but what little I have it worked great. The screen isn't always the clearest with certain programs, though that could just be the programs themselves being written to a lower definition. I also LOVE the tactile feedback on the keyboard and the full mouse touchpad can be clicked, with is nice as well.The only complaint I have is speakers. The speakers are subpart for this price point, and their placement on the underside of the laptop leaves a lot to be desired. That said, the built in bluetooth makes connecting headphones or a bluetooth speaker easy as can be.Overall, Im quite pleased with my purchase. I honestly haven't had a better laptop since toshiba sold their computer branch. I'm pleasantly surprised to find a laptop of equal quality.",0
Bought for my teenager & he loves it! Lightweight. Easy to use/navigate. We use to to video chat when he's away. Camera is incredibly clear. Just as good as a cell.Glad I spent the extra money,0
"I purchased this Chromebook to replace an older one. I love the speaker upgrade but, it is so slow compared to my old one. Pages take a long time to load and when you want to print, it stays on the load screen for several minutes.",0
"My son needed a replacement Chromebook, so I picked this one up on ""Prime Day"". It has been a great replacement, but I was disappointed to learn from my son that it ""was no longer charging"". I decided to order a new charger and that has solved the problem, but I am disappointed that Samsung is packaging a bad charger with their product.Otherwise this Chromebook has been a good/decent chromebook. For those that know chromebooks, you know what that means. :)",0
Not sure if perhaps the more you spend the better the battery but this laptop EATS battery life even on the optimized settings. Literally 30 minutes of battery life! What a joke!,0
"This computer has been excellent. It is very powerful and performs phenomenally for a wide variety of applications, ranging from gaming to school to work. Battery life is the only aspect that can be considered a slight downside, however, by dimming the screen brightness and turning off the keyboard, the battery life can be extended to several hours. The estimated battery life can go as high as 8-9 hours by setting the computer to power-saving mode through the Control Center 3.0 software that comes with it. Another good feature of this laptop is the fact that it has a numpad, as many smaller laptops lack. Overall, this computer was and still is an excellent purchase. Do not hesitate to buy it.",0
computer was too slow the second i got it. i would only get it as like a gift to my grandma who doesnt know much about computers.,0
The display is bright enough,0
I've had this for 9 months and the touch screen no longer works and the port doesn't charge anymore.,0
I bought this to replace my old HP. This is so much faster and really like this laptop. I only use it for small office jobs and I'm not a gamer. However the screen appears to be just fine to me. If you are a gamer you need to spend more dollars on your laptop.,0
"Unfortunately after only 8 shorts months this laptop died. took it to a computer repair place and they said the mother board had a short and it needed to be replaced however after 6 weeks they had zero success finding a new or refurbished mother board, So I'm taking my still broken computer home. I looked on several forums where loads of buyers had the same issue. This is way too much money to be spending to only get 8 months out of a laptop.",0
Great laptop for those who hate windows and viruses.,0
"Everything works fantastic, only issue would be that the computer will overheat if not properly ventilated.",0
"the LED's are a bit bright and hard to look at, and the font used for the keys can be difficult to read at a glance.",0

"I bought this computer for my daughter to have a new reliable computer to use at college. We got it the second week of August but didn't set it up until the third week (just in15 time for her start). It worked until Sept 15 and then the hard drive crashed. Even though it worked less than a month, the seller refuses to replace it or do anything -- they referred me to Asus. Asus refuses to replace it -- only refurbish it. If I wanted a refurbished computer, I would have paid several hundred dollars less and bought one. Totally unacceptable quality and total lack of customer service.",0
Bought as a gift.,0
"You will definitely need a chiller mat for this device, it tends to heat up for gaming. The fan vents are at the top of the keyboard, where the screen hinge is at. But it works quite well. There is still much to learn about how to use the ROG settings and would love to see a clear manual on how best to operate this. It also has the Nvidia G-Force experience, for casting across multiple screens and also recording. So much more computer that I had previously.",0
This is a very nice computer for the money. I like the silver but I would have loved a gold or Rosegold option as well. Also there is no touchscreen but it has a dual Intel processor which is what I needed for my podcast. Also the Video quality is not the best. I would suggest buying an external WebCam if you need the video quality to be better.,0
"Kid loves it....it does everything needed for games, homework, and what not. Has been a good purchase!",0

"the only problem I have had with this laptop is it came with a corrupt OS. it would crash randomly every time I tried to play a game. it wasn't consistent either. there was no warning, it wouldn't lag or get super choppy or anything. it would just abruptly crash. luckily a buddy of mine had another copy of windows. so I reinstalled the OS. since then I have not had any issues with this laptop. it does what I want it to do playing games. just DON'T EXPECT SUPER HIGH END GAMING such as VR and 4k. other than that I love it and am happy with it. it plays games fine (fortnite, borderlands 2, blacklight retribution, left for dead 2, League of legends). also one other thing; you might also wanna go ahead and get a cooling pad with this. the fans in my laptop go on full blast whenever I start gaming. it doesn't really hinder the experience but just to ease things get one.",0
"I purchased this Laptop a few months ago, along with a mouse and other items and both the laptop and mouse started to give trouble approx 1 month after purchase. I reached out to Amazon who off course offers spectacular customer service, they offered me a refund or replacement of the mouse (Though the 30 days had passed), I accepted the replacement because all I wanted was working equipment. The CSR then indicated that I have to liaise with the seller regarding my laptop troubles; but hold on; they are going to reach out to them for me (which was great, because I didn't have to go find them to email them.) WL Distributors (SN Recorded) did reach out and when the videos with the issues were sent, their response was the order has passed 30-days return window, but no worry, the item has a warranty with Lenovo and that I should contact Lenovo to have it sorted. I asked them why can't they do just like amazon and reach out to the company to make it less stressful for the customer. They responded by quoting US laws on returns for me! WL Distributors (SN Recorded) do not match Amazon's impeccable customer service. The issues I have encountered are in the video.",0
"I am happy with this ""new version"" of the Acer Chromebook. It is exactly the same unit outside for sure and I cannot distinguish any internal differences either from the Chromebook I replaced that had been purchased refurbished over two years ago. Not saying I dont like this unit because I do but I can tell no difference whatsoever in operating or internet speed let along startup speed. The blue tooth function is always cutting out and the wi-fi is unchanged so dont get that. It is still the best bargain out there for people like me who mainly to banking...email correspondence...and get their news off the net. I will buy another one when this one deteriorates but dont expect any difference from previous years models.",0

The lighting is customizable across the color spectrum and different colors can be assigned to each of the 4 zones the keyboard is divided into.,0
I had one for school and was very happy about it. But this one is kind slow and also it is not touch screen,0
Just what i needed,0
the beautiful touchpad with it's real buttons.,0
"I received this product on a Sunday. The design is simple, sleek and very appealing. Although it does feel cheap and fragile as the outside all plastic. I did notice that the initial power on required several attempts. I put it on the charger thinking the battery might be dead. The chrome book powered on and I didn’t think anymore about this little issue, and the battery was almost fully charged once I got to the main desktop. I took this device to a conference for notetaking 3 days after receiving it. It worked very well for about 3 hours. Then it shut down spontaneously. The device powers up very quickly so I just restarted the computer. Then it happened again, and again and again. By day five it would only last about 2 to 5 minutes without shutting off spontaneously while running applications. It didn’t even get me through a 3 day conference. I am very disappointed in this product.",0
"Just sharing my user experience on Asus quality:I bought Asus Laptop G751JT laptop on June 12, 2016. Just used it for 1.5 year, then in Jan of 2018, the laptop suddenly crashed and could not be rebooted. I sent it to ubreakifix shop in Cupertino, CA, their final diagnosis indicated that it's due to a defect in the mother board. The replacement cost would be $700-$800. Then I called the Asus Support, Case No. N180343075, the guy said the Service Cost alone would be $690. Hope everybody can be aware of my painful user experience and be sure to buy extended warranty if you choose to buy Asus.My $1300 is completed wasted just after 1.5 years.",0
First MacBook and I am in love! I have been using my computer for two days and still have 60% battery life. Very impressive because I have been using it a lot. I’m still getting use to the different feel on how to use it but it really is self explanatory once you start using it.,0
A bit heavier than I thought.,0
What a great computer. Great directions on how to setup and most is automatically setup for you. You just sip your coffee and let the machine do it for you. Love it!You cannot go wrong with this computer.,0
"I hate it with passion! It gets in my nerves how difficult is to turn this piece of S on, even trying to get it out of sleep mode. It has a mind of it own it gets super slow with no reason. I wish I could just smash it and have money to buy another one!!!!",0
"I nabbed this guy on prime day for cheap, and i'm so glad I did! I just wanted a small portable laptop that functioned like a tablet with a keyboard, and that's exactly what I got. I wanted the battery life and the ability to use Google Chrome, Drive, and Discord -- and that's what this does! It's super easy and has a great display, and while I have a different laptop for using Word (i'm a writer), this is great. I'd recommend this for anyone looking for an easy travel ""tablet with a keyboard"" that has a reliable battery life.",0
"Its very light (4.65ish pounds), looks very sleek and thin",0
This beats the heck out of my old laptop that I have for 6 years however the screen is a bit smaller but I will use my hdmi cord to hook it up to my 4k tv so I am all good now,0
"La verdad me gusto mucho, cumplió todas mis expectativas y esta muy lindo y de muy buena calidad",0
"This is a very good laptop pc used for gaming. Since it's my first I do not have much to compare it to, but mostly everything satisfies me.Good:It runs very quick with today's modern games. From GTA V to Cities Skylines, I have no complains to how it runs. The bootup is also good, only takes a couple of seconds. Screen is ok too with displaying colors, again, nothing to complain about. The best part is the service. The first laptop that arrived was defective. The screen was fuzzy upon startup so I needed to return it. After contacting Amazon they had me return it. The problem was that meant I was out of a laptop for a few days. However, they allowed me to purchase another laptop and wait for that one to arrive before I returned the other one.Bad:It's very loud, especially when you play high demanding games. This is good since the computer won't fry, but headphones are almost a must. The battery life isn't all that good even when I'm not running games, maybe a couple hours tops. It smudges easily by fingerprints all around also. It is kind of heavy and thick, which may serve as a problem for those wanting to fit in a lot of cases.Verdictit is a great choice for someone who needs a portable laptop that wants to play games for a low price. While one can build a PC for cheaper, this comes in handy for the college market.P.S. I made this review after having the laptop for a few months.",0
"I bought this laptop for my daughter for college and for her leisure gaming. When it arrived (faster than expected), we were pleased that Acer added an upgraded CPU (no extra cost) since they ran low on the chip we bought. The extra speed permits gaming at its fastest! The laptop has continued to deliver quality response time, boot time, number crunching and of course gaming speed. This laptop is treasured and I will always keep Acer favorably on my mind! Thank you Acer, you came through for us!",0
Too much price than Dell G15 and less performance and Worst customer service,0
"Hola, realmente le dare duro a esta laptop, para otras cosas de oficina es optima pero para juegos como Counter Strike y otros es una cafetera, se calienta demasiado, ya veo porque la vende a ese precio, ni siquiera bajándole los la calidad de gráficos, se recalienta llega hasta los 94 C°, que mala sorpresa me llevo no la recomiendo, por demás ya le ponen tarjeta grafica, es un horno esta laptop, podría cocinar algo con su ventilador, hasta 79 C° seria pasable, pero 94C° de que estamos hablando, ya he optado por venderla, comprare una que no se ha una cafetera.",0
"A great budget gaming laptop with just a couple weakspots. Ryzen 7 is awesome, however, make sure to add more ram as the onboard GPU takes 4 gig of ram away.ProsSmall bezels make this 17 inch laptop just a hair larger than a normal 15.4 inch laptop.

everything same as i image，if u want to play game，dont buy this，this is for business and work or study,0
The PC is very heavy but its perfect for every day use and i also use it for trading.,0
"I have been using it for a several months now. Writing review on it right now. I love this chromebook. It's my 3rd in about 10 years and so far so good with no problems. Screen quality is good. I have used it for Zoom calls and video messaging and it works as well as my work laptops that are considered top notch and cost 3-4 times as much.I don't game on it but streaming netflix, prime, disney+, shopping, writing documents, browsing the internet, writing emails, video calls and messaging are all awesome and work excellent.",0
Bought for a friend,0
"The keyboard feels nice, good amount of travel on this thin of a laptop",0
"Great quality build and performance. Using it for Engineering 3D drawing, rendering to simulations and personal gaming. Impressive machine, worth paying a bit more for as it is good value for the money.",0
"I just received my Strix Scar II with an RTX 2070... fortunately, I've not seen any of the BSOD horror stories I see in the low star reviews here. I'll update after more time has passed.Overall the machine is pretty nice, and gaming is nearly as fast as on my desktop, but the pretty severe back-light bleed, and the clunky ASUS software (especially the keyboard RGB) leave me a bit underwhelmed by this laptop at the $2200 I paid for it in Feb 2019. That said, it is one of the less expensive options with this hardware config, and perhaps these compromises are what let them hit that price point.Pros:- great gaming frame-rate, decent screen, very responsive.... this thing feels nearly as fast as my 1080 Ti desktop.- reasonably slim and durable form factor- lots of USB-A ports (which I need)- BIOS has a setting to disable the annoying ROG brand POST graphic sound.- the membrane keyboard feels decent and is VERY quiet.Cons:- there is pretty massive screen backlight bleed in the corners (FHD 144hz 3ms screen)... it doesn't really affect functionality, but in a $2200 laptop i expect better- The power button LED is blaring super bright red... I'm going to need to black-marker it or something- fans run loudly at odd times when the laptop is not doing anything intensive .... they calm down, but I don't care for the way the laptop feels like it's a jet taking off just because I powered it on- software-preload came in an abysmal state. drivers were old, on a laptop that was *just* released in the last few weeks. audio was popping. unclear how to update ASUS software. I finally removed some of it, updated some of it, and got it sorted. Audio seems fine now.- setting up keyboard RGB was confusing. I couldn't find the right tool, so I installed ""ROG AURA"" from their website, but this was the wrong tool, laptops need ""ROG AURA Core""... after installing this I was able to separately configure the 4-keyboard-regions, light-bar, and back-of-screen logo like I wanted.- the keyboard layout is a bit weird, especially the arrow keys..- the camera is not only in the lower right of the screen, but it's not angled up, so to actually get my face in frame, I have to tilt the screen uncomfortably far back... i suppose it's better than no webcam, but it's not reasonable for regular use. Fortunately i don't use that much on a laptop.- there is no hardware keyboard remapping tool... something that's pretty important for gaming. I used SharpKeys to do windows registry remapping (capslock->control), but this doesn't work properly with League of Legends for some reason... on my desktop I use a gaming keyboard with a remapping driver and it works great.",0
Broke after four months,0
"I mulled over many different gaming laptops in the $1200 to $1600 range, but I kept coming back to the MSI GL 65 Leopard (my first MSI purchase). I did not want to buy any other brands and model except for this one because of the CPU (i7 10750h), GPU (GeForce RTX 2070), and 144hz screen that this comes with. There's nothing close to this price with this CPU and GPU. The screen is vivid and sharp. As a bonus, the keyboard has good response to it when typing and I like the color customization to the color of the keyboard keys. I also like the fan speed option because it is pretty loud when turned up but I was really impressed the silent mode option which keeps the laptop quiet for the operations I have used it with (surfing, videos, games (Sim, RTS, Strat, MMO, RPG, but not FPS). In addition to the 3 usb ports, there is 1 USB C port as well which is a need for me. Keep in mind that on this laptop, the fan vents blow out in the rear left and right and also the back left side as well so keep those area clear. The AC plug is located in the middle of the right side which some may not like , but it doesn't bother me one bit. Overall I am quite happy with this purchase.A drawback to this laptop is that it comes with only a 512gb m.2 SSD, but I was able to add an additional 2tb SATA SSD to it.",0
When i saw it wasn't going to buy it because i saw in the comments that is was not touchscreen but it is written touchscreen in the title so i said to my self it is cheap but what if it wasn't touchscreen so i just bought it and it turned that it is touchscreen! And if you are looking for a chromebook this is the best choice.,0
Great deal. No issues. Worked perfectly from the start. Ordered a second one for my mom. No issues. So glad I found this deal. Came with refurbished windows sticker and product key. Seems to have been thoroughly tested. Very satisfied with purchase.,0
"It is sleek, light and looks great.",0
"Its an HP and another one that the fans are not working and it is getting hot. The vents are on the bottom of the computer, therefore no where to breath. I just bought a fan cooler Kyolly cooling pad to go with it and it is doing the job. I also have an extended warranty on this computer because I had an HP in the past with a cooling problem. I will not be returning it and not talking to the company because the external fans are doing the job. Sometimes you can get a download to make internal fans work but not sure if that is the problem.As for the computer functions it is fast starts up fast and I like it. The only thing I did not like is it automatically changed all my documents from my old computer to my new. So keep that in mind when you purchase your new computer for memory purposes. Also one drive is still full and that is one reason I purchased a new one. So I will have to get a different cloud source.",0
the fan is a little loud at times.,0
"With the new NV card and 11th Gen CPU released, it is reasonable that the price of this gaming laptop drops in price. At this price level, this gaming laptop can do the work for most games excluding some most advanced 3A games. I bought it for my nephew and he loved it!",0
It is an easy to use computer. But the sound quality is not good. I can barely hear it. Even at full volume I cannot hear Netflix or youtube. Very annoying.,0
I'm absolutely loving the touchpad and feel of the keys as I work,0
This laptop is incredibly spec'd for the price,0
For the price this product looks like it has great value but I wouldn't recommend it. With just general use the computer became scorching hot. Using any application that used the graphics card made the computer too hat to touch on the bottom and the keyboard was barely usable because it felt like your fingers were in an oven.,0
"I purchased my GL65 Leopard after doing extensive research on other laptops in the price range of $1100-$1500, and I can say this is without a doubt the best bang for your buck. It is immensely powerful with the i7-10750H and RTX2070 combo, no other laptop around this price point offers both. You may choose to upgrade RAM and storage, but every game I have tested on this runs on the highest graphics settings without a worry. The fans aren't any louder than similar gaming laptops, but if you're expecting a quiet rig you will sacrifice performance or be paying a lot more. Overall extremely satisfied with my purchase and will be buying MSI again in the future (Which won't be for a while because this laptop is fairly future proof!)",0
"If you game on this prepare to get a decent cooling pad to put in the middle. Once the center heats up it tends to make certain keys stick. In my case it was the spacebar. After popping it off, putting back on and switching cooling pads the keys don't stick anymore.Otherwise super satisfied with this laptop.",0
Good laptop,0
Looks sleek and nice. So far seems really good for the price. Wifi is fast and the screen quality is really nice. If you plan to use it for comp gaming buy a mouse.,0
"This thing is great! I bought the 4GB model which will hopefully last me a few years but it's nice and snappy now. The 16GB of SSD storage is perfect as I use it for school and the biggest file I might be storing would be a picture. It integrates perfectly with my google account! This thing boots up super quick and it sleek and beautiful. It's lightweight, has a long battery life and although it's smaller than a standard laptop, the keyboard is easy to use.Google and partners have done great with Chromebooks and have plenty of features to accommodate. There are multiple physical keyboard shortcuts running along the top of the keyboard to quickly adjust settings. There are also several different hotkey menus which are accessed by keyboard combinations.The only thing I'm bummed about is the lack of Google Play. I'm still giving this thing 5 stars because the Play store should be released soon as it is already available on other Chromebooks.I would highly recommend this to anyone, but especially to someone wanting something that is affordable, easy to use and just a bit more than a tablet.UPDATE 7/21/17 - STILL ROCKSI've gotten more use out of this thing than I first envisioned. I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 and can easily access my Google Drive files that I create and edit on the Chromebook via Goggle Docs. It's still nice and snappy; I have Amazon Prime music running in one tab, working on a Google Docs file in another and browsing Reddit or searching something on a third tab and there's no hesitation. I've enabled the beta build and enjoy several Google Play Store applications. I added an SD card which has expanded on the 16GB of storage. I'm getting very used to the multiple finger shortcuts on the touch pad when navigating Chrome. For instance: putting 2 finger tips on the touch pad and swiping left or right will act as the forward or back button. Also, ""clicking"" on a link by using 2 fingers and pressing on the touch pad, you bring up a menu to open in a new tab among other things. I watch Netflix and HBO Now and can definitely notice the lack of 1080p but it's a ""get what you pay for"" situation, and I knew that going in. This thing is still fantastic for what it is. If you want a proper laptop then buy one -- this is a Chromebook. I'll be back to give another update in a few months.",0
So this is supposed to be a gaming laptop. I put music software on it and it slows it down and sometimes closes the program. I'm really disappointed because this laptop is not cheap.,0
Great price and great computer!!,0
"Runs very nice. Only one issue, the picture seemed to indicate it had a web cam, but it doesn't. Anyone buying should verify that if the web cam is important.",0
Bought it for working at home due to the pandemic. Very good computer only wish it had lighted keyboard.,0
"Great condition, great product! More than happy",0
I had so many problems with this laptop. First of all the speakers are terrible but that wasn’t the worst thing. My laptop was so faulty. Keyboard wouldn’t work half the time & when it did work it would only type in reverse. It’s cheap for a reason. Pick a better laptop.,0
"The thin bezzels allow this 17.3"" laptop to fit into bags designed for 15.6"" laptops.",0
2nd time in 6 months it stops working. And battery life is utter garbage. Laptop is great but battery power is absolute crap.,0
"It works as advertised, is reasonably fast and easily expandable.",0
"Ah where to start .. I shipped this laptop half way across the world to Abu Dhabi and boy was it worth it.Great SPECs for reasonable priceThe battery is not so great though, doing some work on the laptop unzipping and installing lasted the battery about less than 2 hours",0
high cpu usage with 1 browser open,0
nice laptop for someone who only needs a laptop/tablet for minimalist design and only uses youtube/netflix/online banking/bill payments/etc. not complicated to use and great screen,0
"I really wanted a water resistant keyboard and this chromebook has it. So far there are no real negatives at all. It's just what I was looking for. It's lightweight, keyboard keys are easy to type on, works great. I've had several chromebooks and use them heavily so need one as durable as this.",0
Just like the chromebooks we get in school. Not too small or too big. Bought it for school,0
Love the touchscreen. Works great and fast too. Purchased Word for it and its works perfectly. You can also use google docs instead. Happy with the purchase and the price. Hope it lasts a long time.,0
"Bought this for normal use and a little bit of gaming. Overall, it's a great laptop that can handle a few tasks at the same time and work as normal. The battery life could be better but it's still enough.",0
"This is my second laptop, I was a desktop guy, my previous laptop an ASUS X542UF, excellent and reliable machine, I fall in love with the brand just because that one, and 3 years later was looking for an upgrade and another great experience.Once I notice this new OLED laptops generation and the amazing screen quality, I did't hesitate into go for it. The materials quality and everything on it looks fascinating.Last but not least, just because of this feedback, ASUS is giving us a 90 days warranty extension.The brand is rocking!!!?",0
works fast but no cd drive,0
This product is awesome. The battery life is great. It is so lightweight compared to my other laptops.I am so please with the product!!!,0
Pista dise?o muy bien,0
"Compré este equipo para edición de video, la verdad es que no he jugado un minuto en esta computadora. El rendimiento es excelente. Los colores del monitor sí cambian un poco cuando se comparan entre diferentes monitores. El precio que obtuve fue genial. Muy satisfecho con esta compra.",0
"Bought this laptop back in November 2018, and I have already had send it back to the manufacture. I was editing photos when all of a sudden it stopped and displayed the ""Blue Screen of Death"". It would not enter recovery nor would it boot up from a thumb drive. ( Yes I made sure security was off in BIOS). Luckily I was able to recover everything from my hard drive via an adapter, before I flashed the recovery OS back on the Hard Drive; Still nothing.Even when this was working, my presets in Light Room would hesitate to load and make changes at times. Worst laptop I’ve owned, and definitely not a good first experience with SSD. Hopefully ASUS can repair it so I can sell it.",0
Every aspect of this little gaming laptop exceeded my expectations. For the specs given it has no problems running any game I throw at it. It does run hot but not hot enough to damage anything.I highly recommend as a cheaper gaming laptop.,0
Touch screen did not work. returned to Amazon for replacement. After several days I called and was told I would have the replacement in two days. Didn't get it and called again only to be told they had NO information on it and was told they would refund monies.. Absolute BS!! Say up to two weeks for refund. $1300 isn't 13 cents. Never again!!!!! Of course the call center is out of our country!,0
Good laptop In terms of quality for the price and performance is strongAnd RTX 3080 GPU 16GB it awesomeGood work gigabyte,0
"I bought this laptop for school and casual gaming. Not 30 minutes in it crashes, I updated the drivers which helped but I couldn’t even run Minecraft for more than a minute. Refurbished my ass, had to pay extra to ship to MSI to fix. Would give it one start but I called support and they were very nice and covered the cost to ship it to msi??",0
so far I like this laptop except for McAfee's pop up that keeps coming up even though I didn't order their software. Very annoying and so far I haven't been able to delete it.,0
"Good picture quality and decent audio for a chromebook. Glitches when using Google Maps, might need to load newest Chrome operating system. i thought this would have the latest Chrome OS and I thought it would automatically update. Reliable for web surfing most sites. Decent battery. Product shipped out fast, thank you.",0
This was the worse. Purchase it ever made. First off it was a 218.00 at best buy brand new...i paid 400 and something...and it wasn't new it was returned and I had so many files on it and a lot of viruses my son has to fills it where I could use it ...and they wanted 50% to restock. Ridiculous....It wish I would've read the reviews firsthand now its doesn't work cause its says my wifi adapter isn't. Downloaded right or something. I still can't take classes,0
Will handle whatever you throw at it.,0
"Great laptop, really fast.",0
cool laptop,0
"I feel this laptop was well worth the money, very fast and runs every game maxed out at at least 100fps or more.Build quality is top notch. Only con I can really think of with this laptop while using it for a few weeks is the speakers kinda suck and could have been better.",0
"Just keep it plugged and you’re good vr compatiblePlay any game smoothly love it, fans are loud what do you expect but are customizable.",0
"Not a Samsung issue, but It was too small for my big hands so I gave it to my son who likes it very much.",0
Thought I was buying a brand new computer. Instead I received an old dusty Ps4. Unacceptable.,0
"The battery lasts about an hour, but you have to think, for the type of hardware this machine has, it lasts quite long. I wouldn't have it any other way. I love playing SWTOR on it. I use it for everything. Good laptop, would buy again if I needed to.",0
"the model I was sent is a refresh of the Chromebook 3, so it has a longer lifespan and I can't complain about it! The performance of this machine is decent for the price. You should know what you want to do with it before you even consider purchasing it. I only needed it for editing text and a few pictures on Google Slides (I'm a language teacher) and this one is good enough for that. REMEMBER this Chromebook model will only get supported until June 2022.",0
One of my favorite things I own,0
"2 months in and it suddenly went completely blank. No predator startup logo, no getting to bios, no booting from external media, no way in.",0
Have always had good luck with HP refubished,0
It’s an ok laptop,0
"I bought this device back in 2017 when I started college classes and my old windows laptop took a dump. I have to say that this machine does everything I needed it to do for all my classes with no problems at all and the battery life is so good that I never took my charger with me, even if I was there all day.The screen has good brightness, but it doesn't have the best viewing angles, but at this price I can't expect it to be perfect. Actually, I have seen worse screens on higher priced laptops. I saw some fellow students using Macbooks, but using Google Docs and just web surfing. I would tell them if that's all they are going to do, then maybe next time just get a Chromebook.There are some nicer chromebooks out there, but the value on this one is hard to beat for Chrome OS.",0
"I don't use this for much other than writing and surfing the internet, but it is perfect for it. Small, compact and lightweight.",0
"My son bought this for himself with my account. He had no idea, granted that’s on him, that this really is an a computer. It’s a Microsoft platform that runs apps only. That means he cannot install Adobe acrobat DC or any other necessary .exe software that he needs for school. My favorite oxymoron, “Microsoft works“… Yeah… Right",0
Still early but love it so far,0
Great little computer. Works awesome for what I need it for. Charges well. Battery lasts for quite awhile. Super simple and easy to set up.,0
It ran out of hardrive space after I downloaded 1 app,0
"So far this has been a wonderful purchase. The processor is so fast, that’s what I noticed the most is how fast it is. Super excited to get the M1 ship at such a discounted rate.",0
"La laptop es muy bonita, y todo en aspecto físico.Si tenían dudas solo tienen dos puertos USB, Puerto tipo C, entrada para audífonos y HDMI.Es estético, eso sí la parte de afuera se ensucia mucho al tocarlo jejeje.Pros:Es ligeramente pesada,Arranca súper rápido, prende en cuestión de segundosPara trabajos de Office es muy buena y programas de dise?o da el ancho deseable aunque si la pantalla es bastante nítida y pierde color en el programa.He usado Photoshop y ilustrator y corren bastante bien al igual que abrirlos. Con edición de vídeo y. Animación no he probado pero en un futuro lo diré.El espacio si es algo limita pero no hay nada que no se pueda expandir con un disco duro externo y la memoria ram si se puede expandir hasta 32 GB.También con las clases en línea es bastante buena, obviamente la cámara no es tan buena pero cumple su función para las clases. Aproximadamente me dura unas 8 horas aprox.Y para juegos quizás unos 3 o 4 aproxContrasQuizás el color nítidoEl teclado puede ser molesto puesto que viene sin ? pero no se le coloca un teclado en espa?ol y queda arreglado.Que le faltan puertos pero igual por el precio y comprando un adaptador podrá hacer la diferencia.Otra es que se ensucia rápido.El volumen es bastante bueno pero quizás para otros no les agrade.Puede ser algo tedioso configurarla al espa?ol los programas, los jugadores y todo lo que incluye su lenguaje ya que es inglésY eso sería todo.Para mí es una buena inversión por lo que se paga, si deseas meter más dinero por otra laptop estaría bien pero está cumple con sus funciones, te la recomiendo.",0
"Pros:-Great specs with enough power to throw most any 1080p/60fps gaming at max specs-Very nice screen, 144hz and pretty good brightness\color-Fans don't seem to run too loud (more below)-Nice form factor and aestheticsCons:-Built in speakers are useless-A little more work to add a 2nd SSD than previously laptops I've ownedReview: In short, I really love this laptop. I bought this mainly for 1080p\60fps gaming and video editing. My previous laptop handled video editing rather well too, but with the power of this I can edit and render 4k video at very good speeds, more than I need honestly. Since most of my side work with this requires fast turn arounds and very high video quality this works out very well.In terms of gaming, both gaming on my TV (at 1080p) and my ultrawide monitor (2560 x 1080) works flawlessly. In fact, for only a few modern titles with insane graphics did the fans kick on high and obvious signs of hard work happened. I have no doubt this can push pretty acceptable 4K gaming as well, but at the moment I don't have much interest in the higher resolutions. In the future that might change. Gaming on the built in screen is awesome, I get 144hz on almost all the games I play and it looks very, very good. I tried some RTX games and while some like Minecraft shows how the tech could change older games, in newer games I only noticed if I was trying to find differences. Again as the tech progresses I'm sure that will change too.I really like the look of this laptop and it feels ""nice"" in my hands. I know a few reviewers didn't like the USB ports so close to the front but personally I like having a few as close as possible when couch gaming. Another thing pointed out by some is the loudness of the fans, however I've had the opposite experience with mine. The fan barely needs to run, and when it does it doesn't even come close to as loud as my other gaming laptops have been.Finally the cons. The speakers are garbage. The sound is very low, and what little sound you can hear is canned and missing all the bass. Get some external speakers (there are even some you can clip on a laptop, I have those coming and will review those later) or headphones\headset. Adding a second SSD was a bit more work than I expected, lots of screws and needing more force than I felt comfortable to use to open. However, I am spoiled as the last 2 gaming laptops I've had used a single screwed bay to add extra storage and RAM.Final Thoughts: If you want a great laptop and don't want to deal with waiting for the whole RTX 30* issues happening to subside this is a nice choice for sure. I imagine this will hold me over for at least 3-4 years which is exactly what I as wanting.",0
Takes a little getting used to after my 17 inch ASUS but this is a little gem of a computer,0
This computer has a hardware issue that results in the blue screen of death multiple times a week. I do not recommend.,0
"It's always a good idea to delay reviewing a product until you have assessed its quality or fragility.1.) Within three months after the purchase, the left clicker on the touchpad collapsed. It simply sank into the computer and stayed in there loosely. It was fixed by HP in August, 2020. Same exact thing happened again in June, 2021.2.) Within a year-and-a-half, the screen developed a permanent 'volcanic eruption' appearance on the left side (see photo).3.) When I sent the laptop to HP for repair, it had a beautiful new-look body shell. When I got it back, it had an older shell with the non-slip rubber on the bottom falling apart. The original computer info sticker on the bottom was now replaced with cheap peel-and-stick.4.) A minor inconvenience: the headphone jack, 2 USB ports, HDMI, charging port...are all on the same side. At least place a 3rd USB port, or move one of the two, on the other side.Bottom line: HP quality is subpar. I have old laptops, some from the 1990's, that have never had ONE problem.",0
I have had some issues with the software it brings (multiple reset requests when updating).,0

The sound quality was better than expected and the sheer portability is king for a truck driver,0
"Cuando me llegó llegó sin pila, (se me hizo raro) posteriormente la puse a cargar, la prendí (tardo mucho en prender) hice la configuración y empecé a utilizarla la pantalla se veía opaca, y los botones fallaban cuando la quería apagar no se apagaba se volvía a aprender hasta que después de 6 veces logré apagarla, la volví a prender y me salió pantalla azul...

Perfect business laptop. Flawless. No sense to own anything heavier,0
"It slowed down within few weeksNow, exactly after 4 months form purchase date, it quit working.I do not recommend this product at all.",0
This was a Christmas present from my husband..,0
"Buena computadora , aunque no tiene mucha memoria",0
This computer is powerful and wonderfully lightweight!,0
"Excellent in every regard, except outdoor brightness.",0
It's not touch screen,0
So far so good. Doesn't get very loud.,0
Really really really fast wifi,0
"the powers that be decided to stop supporting this laptop. i don't care, i'm still using it. i lost a lot of pictures when they took the cloud away, but i couldn't figure how to access the cloud anyway. i've had this since 2018, and i still pay bills, email, shop and search the web on it. i've had to buy 2 replacement charger cords because they frayed, but the unit itself is a tank.",0
Love itt,0
"Nothing wrong with the system, but it took more than 2 weeks to arrive, and in the process, the M2 dropped in price. So I'll return this and get the M2. A waste of my time when I could have used it most. The wait was really disappointing.",0
"This horrible, horrible item was shipped to my granddaughter for use in virtually learning. The screen was scratched, and the battery would not charge. The company that sent it contended that the returned item was not the item sent and would return only 50 percent of my almost 700 dollars! For shame!!",0
"One of the keys popped off during normal usage and when I tried to place it back I ended up bending the little tabs on the bottom not knowing how delicate they were. Contacted Acer and was told they do not sell any replacement keys which I find to be absolutely ridiculous considering how delicate they are, and that's more than enough to steer me away from this company for good.",0
I give this product a five star bec. It has good battery life that’s what I need for gaming laptops. The only thing that isn’t good is the mouse pad other than that everything works perfectly and fast. I just did a battery test it last 9hrs for downloading games. It takes 1hr and half to get fully charged.,0
boot time is short and everything runs incredibly fast even with the highest game settings,0
the laptop is a great combination of light weight and performance,0
I have no major complaints about this device. It is great quality for the price.,0
"Beautiful screen and keyboard, thin and light.",0
the laptop is fine but certain keys are stiff and stuck already,0
"This laptop is very responsive, very fast. i have read other ratings saying that it is flimsy, I find it sturdy. The only problem with it is the keyboard, without full light over it you can barely read it and it is not backlit, the letters are etched over silver keys, very hard to read them. I had to buy a desk top lamp to use the laptop. Other wise, a very good laptop.",0
It has a lot of power under the hood in a very nice and easy to use package.,0
"Just absolutely stunning. I've had problem with previous Lenovo Yoga 720.I was trying to go for a lower budget, since the battery only have a difference by ~4000 mWh (Yoga 720 has 48k mWh). It only lasts for about ~3-4 hrs (advertised 7.5 hrs) on it. With XPS13 (advertised ~ 9.5 hrs), I get about 6-8 hrs consistently on 1 charge. I suspect it has something to do with the hardware base level consumption, but don't take my word for it.PRO:- very light!!!- sleek carbon fiber. you can see if there's any oil mark or dirty things and clean up easily- speaker is great with the Max Waves enhancement software included (it can get very loud!)- highest screen brightness is great compared to Yoga 720, but I have to constantly use at max during the day, so maybe it's not as bright as I think- tiny bezels along the screens are just stunning- although it might get heat up quickly (see below), it only affects the bottom. Meaning you won't feel it through the keyboard like some laptops wouldCONS:- camera at awkward position... but I don't video call much so it's not a big problem- lowest screen brightness is not low enough for some situations (still hurt my eyes at night in the dark even with night light)- CPU throttling causes the fan to run very loudly sometimes, and heats up very very quickly, but not to the point of overheatSome other tiny things are here (not necessarily PRO or CONS):- when using Alt + F# combos (Alt + F4 for example), XPS13 automatically detect it and send the F4 without having to press Fn button- the up/down/left/right are a little bit small, but they manage to squeeze in the PgUp and PgDn buttons. I wish it was the Home and End button instead, but that's just my preference- BIOS configurations are very thoroughly and you can set almost every single aspect of it- screen only go so far (about 30-40 degrees beyond upright (90 deg.) angle) so sometimes, you might have to deal reposition it for your need- mixed feeling for the keyboard backlight. it automatically turns on and off, but very quickly (like seconds). you could describe the fading away as a little bit too quick- 4K screen is not necessary. I change it to 1080 so CPU/GPU doesn't consume as much battery to process",0
"I had to purchase this laptop more out of haste because my previous laptop had complications, but I can say I'm actually quite happy with this one. It worked as expected for me and has a quick running speed for the applications I need as a university student. The smaller size makes it much lighter and easier to carry around in a smaller backpack, which is helpful when you have to walk around and switch to different parts of campus nearly every day. So far there hasn't been any major issues that would have made me give a lower rating, so sverall I'd say that the purchase was 100% worth it and I got the product as expected.",0
"The letters and space bar were sticking. I sent the product back, still no refund.",0
What a great purchase for Software Defined Radio work across the full frequency spectrum.,0
"So again there is alot with this laptop, id strongly suggest that you read everything i have to say.i give this laptop a 5 star because its incredible, the control center it comes with is very bad though. i had to delete it to be able to run better frames, when i first got it i hopped on fortnite immediately since my desktop is only a 2060 i was exited to so what a 3060 can truly do, as i got on i i turned on max frames and loaded into creative, i was lagging decently and my frames where at 140-40. i get 200+ on my 2060 so at first my heart sunk, i was so worried because i got this laptop as a basic replacement for my pc so i could have a dual pc setup, but i didnt panic to much, i thought about the reviews and they said the control center worked terrible, after i uninstalled it, which only took my 2 minutes, i was getting 400-500 frames everywhere in the game, i spent 400 dollars for my 27 inch gaming monitor, 240hz, but i swear this monitor is alot better, i was not playing better though because i had switch set ups completely but i can tell ill get better with tis laptop, i bought it for 1299, which i do believe is the best price for a 3060 and an intel core i7 11800H and a 240 hz monitor, i couldnt find anything better and i looked for 3 months straight. some bad things about the laptop, is that the battery is so BAD!!! if you want to have a laptop for all day then you'll have to go into settings and turn the hz to 60, now i dont think i need a good battery, i mean its actually not bad its just that its a gaming laptop its not meant to be unplugged for 9 hours straight, also the camera, the camera is terrible, not only is it at the bottom of the screen but the colors and frame and resolution you get on the camera is terrible, i would recommend this laptop if your only choosing it because it has a camera lolOther then that, i do believe that this laptop is truly amazingBy your favorite YoutuberLove NAFIN",0
"I am disappointed in this unit. This is the third ASUS laptop that I have purchased in the past 10 years.The video card does not seem to work with the built in monitor. I use ti for a 3d CAD program. It does not render any better than my old unit which does not have a video card as large, or as many processors. I even downloaded the new Nvida drivers. I called tech support for ASUS and they could not help.",0
"Great all around chromebook that's much faster than most. After doing research on actual speed tests, this model ranked in the top 10 as 2019. Plus, its thicker than most so it's perfect for kids who generally toss them around a lot. My son loves the touchscreen to use it as a tablet. Highly recommended.",0
"I love the graphics on this computer, which are an upgrade for me after my 10 year old Acer Aspire died. That one had touchscreen, which I miss, but this newer Swift is a great laptop. It is lightweight. I love that as sometimes I travel with my computer and lighter is better! The only thing I haven't liked is that even when the sound is at 100, it isn't very loud. Two thumbs up Acer! You have earned my brand loyalty. I LOVED my Aspire, so Acer was the only brand I really wanted to look at when I had to replace it.",0
I love that this laptop is lightweight and the perfect size. Thought it was going to be much smaller but thankfully it was just right!,0
"Nice laptop, couldn’t be happier.",0
"Es mentira lo de el lector de huella integrado en el teclado, no tiene ningún lector de huellas digitales ni en el teclado ni en ninguna parte.",0
This laptop is very fast at everything I’ve thrown at it and the midnight blue colour is beautiful.,0
Great laptop! Love it. Arrived promptly and was packaged very well. Very pleased.,0
"I'm a PC guy, not a apple fanboy. Credit where is deserved though, Apple does make nice if overpriced devices. It definitely has the best screen of any laptop I've bought. The M1 battery life and performance is quite impressive for a laptop for this size and price. Keyboard is good too. Points deducted for apple pulling it's usual crap.... Only 8 gigs of ram and 256 of storage. Lack of ports too.",0
I like it lighter then the old one,0
"Very well designed Chromebook. We've had now for 5 months and have not had any issues with it. It's pretty fast in accessing the web, apps, etc. My daughter loves the screen size and how light it is.",0
Ok,0
HDMI2 output 4K to my LG 4K monitor very well.,0
Product arrived in time. Everything works great. Great bang for your buck. Sacrifices cd/DVD drive for lightweight portability. Excellent value.,0
"The hinge is a bit stiff, and cannot be opened by a single hand like the macbooks",0
Works Wonderfully,0
I love the Laptop. It looks cool and cool red keyboard lights. Screen is super clear. Runs great for everything I use it for since I bought it. So far there isn't anything I don't like about it.,0
"it's a great overall computer, but the battery is awful. After only 2 years my computer has to be plugged in to work, the battery just doesn't work.",0
Not enough hard drive space on this device. I will be installing a 1TB SSD on Tuesday.,0
"Love it, so happy with my purchase. I have a smaller Chrome Book I bought a few years ago thru Amazon and it still works great too. Just wanted something bigger, so very easy to use because of already being established with my previous chrome book.",0
"I got this on black Friday deal and am very pleased with my purchase. I only play a couple games, but so far everything I've tried has ran perfectly. It's lightweight and super fast. Not loaded with a lot of bloatware. I had it up and running within an hour.",0
"It worked for 3 days and I only used it for about an hr each day, batter life is horrible dies in about an hr.As said it worked for 3 days then it would turn on but screen would go black and it stayed black as laptop booted up. But when it did run it was fine for gaming or office use",0
"Gets the job done, good price.",0
Bought this computer for my son for his stem school. It's so awesome I can't pry him off of it.,0
"The computer works amazing for everything I use it for - running my work's virtual desktop, streaming on discord, playing in roll20, running casual games like stardew valley and the sims 4. However, the fans are ridiculously loud, even when the computer is idling. I read in reviews that this unit has loud fans, and I thought, how loud could they really be? They are ASTOUNDINGLY loud, it will make you reevaluate your previously held notions of loudness. Any time it's on, even if you're just looking at it from across the room and not asking anything of it, It sounds like an ancient desktop tower that has been baking in the sun for hours and is on its last breath from a lifetime of mining bitcoins.I didn't think it'd be a dealbreaker, but it's driving me bananas so I'll be returning this computer.(Edit - I was being flip, the reason I returned the computer was because of a hardware issue in the keyboard. But the reason I didn't exchange it for the same model, was the noise.)",0
I love the color of this computer. It performs very well with everything. I love the keynote too. I am very pleased with the settings i can do for the keyboard too!,0
Solo para uso personal y el desempe?o es muy pobre,0
Best price and performance gaming laptop !,0
Disliked mot knowing there are not many apps made for the Mac book. Guess that’s why I hung onto my other windows computers,0
I really like it. It seems to be built nicely the only down side is I had to update the drivers since I wanted to use it as a light gaming computer. Other than that I haven't had a problem.,0
"Buyer beware, screen is of very poor quality. One dead pixel in the has turned into an entire side of the screen.",0
"The computer is also heavier than my old computer which is weird because according to what is on here, it should be lighter.",0
"Great computer for what I need, had to take it out of S mode and I'll have to upgrade the ram (easy to do) but overall a great budget computer",0
"I've owned laptops since I was old enough to use them and this was supposed to be a treat to myself but it was very disappointing. Couldn't handle a lot of games on ultimate settings and even when the graphics weren't on very high settings it still consistently overheated to the point of blue-screening multiple times a day. I've used multiple laptop pads to try cooling it down but it just doesn't work.I have it for work and personal use, and it was crashing without even being in CPU-intensive apps. Would not recommend.",0
"I hated this laptop. I switched from a Windows 10 PC to this Chromebook after reading extensive reviews and information from the manufacturer and Google. An incentive to purchasing this item was 100 GB of free Google Drive storage space. I attempted to redeem this offer and was told the offer expired for my device after extensive talks with Google. Additionally, I am completely unable to print from the Chromebook. I can use Google Cloud Print from my Windows PC, but not from the Chromebook. Google support is of NO use. English is absolutely not their first language and it is very clear they know NOTHING about the products they are supporting. They will NOT escalate to a supervisor, no matter what. I do not recommend purchasing any item that runs on Google Chrome simply because of their horrid technical support.",0
"Not a good product. After few months, Google started to stop working repeatedly and I need to reload.",0
Light like a feather and 15 inch !!Great screen and fast on everything4 power core8 efficiency coreVery pleased from hin the trackpad is huge and the samsung eco system so convenientRecommended for students and other peaple who carry there laptop to anyware,0
This is a very good laptop.,0
"I absolutely love this laptop. This replaced a 4 year old Asus Vivobook and I could not be happier.Pros:- Sleek, well designed and good build quality- Love the keyboard, keys have just the right amount of click- FAST- Very portable while still being very powerful- Long battery life, consistently get around 8 hours and it fully charges in about 1.5 hours- Full array of ports- Just enough weight to feel substantial but not too heavy- One of the best touchpads I have ever used- Fingerprint sensor is convenient, fast and awesome- Speakers are great and very loudCons:- I wish the screen got a bit brighter, it's also a bit reflective- While the aluminum interior and the matte lid are nice and high quality, the plastic on the bottom of the laptop leaves a bit to be desired- The laptop sometimes takes a few seconds to reconnect to wifi after being in sleep mode, but it's not really a huge dealOverall I am completely satisfied with this laptop. I have a couple small issues that I listed above, but no machine is perfect. And for the price and the high quality, high-spec'd machine that you get for that price - you can't beat it.",0
"The build quality of this computer is good. Keyboard feels nice and the key layout is ideal. the touchpad feels nice to use and is responsive to touch and clicks. I hate the bulky design for just a 14 inch screen and i've never liked huge palmrests. The audio quality was a nice surprise; both loud and clear. I'm mixed on the display, its got great resolution and is an IPS panel but something just feels off to me when viewing videos. Boot times are great, i'm on the login screen in 10seconds from a cold boot. Battery has been great, i got around 4hours on maximum brightness watching 720p videos on Youtube. Daily use, i expect more as i'm never going to have it on maximum brightness normally. Overall, the system feels responsive and quick. I haven't used Chrome OS in, i think, a couple years now (I had an Acer C720) so i was excited to see what Google had done with the system. I dont see too many changes overall but i like that Google still seems to be actively supporting it as i hear that Android app support is incoming and an potentially a way to allow chromeos to be able to print to any printer instead of just those that support Google cloud print.",0
"If you’re just looking for a simple laptop to send emails, go on social media, watch YouTube videos, etc. this one will do just that. Overall I don’t have any issues with it lagging. It’s easy to use and does what I need it to do. Good battery life. The screen is very clear and the sound is great too. I will say the keyboard letters did fade easily so I bought a cheap keyboard cover. I will also say the left click button is kind of loose and I’m not an aggressive clicker! For the most part I use the finger pad because it’s quicker when I’m browsing the web. So for the price I paid....I wouldn’t expect that to happen. The durability on that part could be better.",0
"I received this item legit 2 days ago, and I'm already noticing issues. The track-pad is extremely sensitive, to the point where just hovering over a button will press it. My hand is brushing the trackpad slightly as I'm typing this, and it's highlighting the text and I can't un-highlight. I tried bringing the sensitivity down to the lowest setting, but it hasn't helped. The screen is also turning black at random times. It's not so frequent that it's a serious issue, but I've also only had it for 2 days and something is already malfunctioning. To be fair, this might be a software issue, rather than hardware.There are pros - the laptop is extremely light and sleek. It's very portable, fast, with a great display. Some features I find slightly redundant, like the fingerprint scanner. I am considering returning it, I'll try it out for another week or two and see if the problems persist/if there's a way to fix them.",0
"There’s nothing I don’t like and I’m sure I have not explored everything in my new Air. pro, the screen quality is great, I do not have touch screen and I do not play games on the Computer only on my IPhone.To make along story short, it’s great.",0
"Works great, processing speed if fast",0
"when opening the screen one-handed, the bottom half (more or less) stays flat on the table.",0
"I do not regret buying it but to me having had it now for maybe 2 months and the white letters on the keyboard are beginning to already seem to fade away is not a good thing. I predict in another 6 months I would have to then add an external keyboard to this so I can use it and see the keys. HP you can do better than this, I expect this from an Acer not an HP.",0
It doesn't work I was told it had a bug in it!,0
It works really well and is very fast.,0
"I bought my Dell XPS113 in Costco for about $1,000 after their discount.There were problems with it from the very beginning - noisy fan, cursor jumped around when typing, signs of overheating, etc. An accidental water spill in a keyboard killed this machine instantly : it has no minimal protection against this kind of damage. Costco too had no warranty attached to a regular purchase and repair cost was the same as the price of a new machine. Needless to say, I would not recommend this computer.",0
"No touch screen, basic laptop for every day use",0
Bought to work from home. User friendly. Gets the job done. Can't go wrong for the price.,0
NOT A TOUCHSCREEN,0
"Decided to call technical support. First time, he made some trouble shootings and it worked. Less than 2 weeks later, same issue. Called again, no trouble shooting this time. I need to mail to their address in Texas. Shipping paid by me, even during warranty. I will be purchasing a computer for my son to be in college son and it definetly will not be an Acer.",0
Never will buy Chromebook again. Also issues with touch screen. Really upset I cant return or exchange it.,0
Good value laptop.. Fast and responsive. Very light. Just switch out from S mode,0
Product seemed ok at first but hinges are way too flimsy as first one broke within a few days and second also broke in a few weeks.,0
Excellent Service. Delivered on time. 8Ram is always my starting point. Likes it.,0
Great gaming laptop!!,0
"The hardware has flaws on the main display and the touch panel display.The main display has a couple of brighter spots, and last week, the trackpad display stopped working.We called ASUS support today, and after one hour, Then the diagnose confirmed a hardware issue. We would need to send it to repair, pay the shipping and additional costs. We will not!Horrible customer experience with an expensive notebook that is only14 months old!Sadly this will probably be my first and last ASUS notebook.I will go back to the good traditional and reliable brands!",0
I like the fact that it does not have windows. Perfect for internet use and some small projects.,0
Do not be fooled this computer is the best it runs any game you want,0
"I take it to school every day, it's good because it's not heavy",0
It was a beast at first. Worked fine until I got a black screen that I could only get away with a hard reset. Had tried it on a couple intensive games and gotten 100+ frames on ultra settings. Now hardware is messed up and I can’t get any more then 20 fps on any game. Laptop laggy and have gone through 2 different IT people at Lenovo.,0
"To start off, this laptop has blown me away. If you are looking for an affordable laptop running a very controversial OS, you've come to the right place. To start, the laptop externally looks and feels amazing. The lid is a nice brushed metal while the rest of the laptop is a durable plastic. I read about an issue where the keyboard flexes, and yes, with pressure the keyboard will flex; however, if you're not pushing down with LOTS of force, you will not notice it. At times the keyboard can feel mushy, but I don't really mind it. The fingerprint scanner is a great feature and allows you to unlock the laptop very quickly.Here are some issues I faced with the laptop:-While streaming video or listening to music, the laptop speakers starting skipping and got caught on one sound-byte to create a very unpleasant experience. A simple update of my sound drivers warranted the fix. (Remember, this is an issue in regards to the operating system, but I included this issue just incase anyone experiences it and thinks its a hardware malfunction.)-The backlit keyboard is amazing; however, more operating system issues caused the feature to stop working after an update. Fixed this by uninstalling the ATK Package and reinstalling the newer version on a website.-The only issue I've experienced with the laptop itself and not the operating system is in regards to the trackpad. Sometimes it sticks and does not allow me to click it again, but it seems to be diminishing as I use it more. And the battery life, it isn't that spectacular.[Update: Trackpad issue has completely disappeared after one month of use]My final thoughts are that this laptop is an amazing steal for the price. Fan isn't loud, websites, apps, & programs open quickly and I would even be so bold as to compare this to a MacBook, (the red-headed stepsister of course, but nonetheless)One last thing: If you are not exactly tech-savvy, a Windows operating system might not be for you. I would recommend a Chromebook if you don't want to deal with the hassle of Windows.",0
Purchase this in February and it just stopped working. Do not waste your money!!!!!! It is set up in an office so there is no reason that this should stop coming on.....DONT BOTHER WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY ARE AWFUL!!!!!,0
It can handle any game perhaps not at highest settings but it's well worth the money,0
"After initial setup, the machine stopped being able to connect to the internet. Wifi wasn’t even an option anywhere to be found in settings or anywhere. I got a replacement and the same thing happened to the replacement. Nothing was clicked, the awful driver was no where to be found. I do not recommend.",0
Great computer !,0
I am 80 but was able to get going on it right away!Seems to be just what i need!Thank you!,0
I really love this product so far,0
"1 pixel muerto desde que llegó a colombia y uno más 6 meses después la garantía internacional no cubre la reparación ya que no tienen los insumos, aunque si lo llevo a un centro de reparación y pago si tienen el panel :/ no recomiendo esta compra si es afuera de estados unidos por la lotería con el panel",0
It's so cool to have a moveable workstation,0
Love the thin design! Beautiful screen. Great features. Fast shipping. So far so good!,0
"Amazing performance, the SSD makes the difference during the start up (10 seconds or less) and you can upgrade it, the cooling system is one of the best I've tested so far, no thermal issues at all!.. Good weight for a gaming laptop and the 1050ti is just enough for most games in high - ultra settings.. I normally use it as my college laptop and the battery performance is ok for small-medium tasks (2.5 - 4 hours), I will recommend you to plug it in to obtain full performance during your gaming sessions. Great deal!",0
The OS works fine with and without the keyboard and it's pretty intuitive.,0
"First of all it's a beautiful notebook. Very well build, aluminum body, relatively light when you compare to same category notebooks. Great screen, 120hz makes a difference even when you are working on word or PowerPoint. Great trackpad. My second notebook is MacBook pro, and I would say the razer has a better overall build quality.When you're not using it for gaming it has a good battery life, around 5 hours. But when gaming it's not so good. Beware that you won't get full power of your gpu if you are not plugged in.... I noticed that when I was running shadow of the Tomb raider and I was making 50fps avarege, as soon as I plugged at the outlet it jumped to 75fps.It has all the ports that you're gonna need... USB, thunderbolt, hdmi, mini display....It's a great notebook, but of course you're paying a premium for the razer quality, you can get same spec notebook for less, but not same quality.That's my humble opinion. Hope it was helpful.",0
"Perfecta, no muy grande ni muy pequeña, la pantalla NO es táctil y la resolución podría ser mejor pero si la necesitas para lo más básico es ideal.",0
"I'll start off with I have had a RoG for years that I abused the hell out of and it last through 5 years of constant gaming for hours on end and with a heavy load on graphics (high population WvW servers in GW2). I'm glad I kept it, because I despise this computer. It's pretty to look at and it's super light and that's about all the positive I can muster on it.Probably doesn't help that I'm posting while pissed as my main issue with this computer just happened yet again - while gaming, the computer keyboard just stops working. I think it overheats and then it doesn't matter what key you hit, nothing works. I have to hit the power button to be able to log semi-restart and it seems to jog the computer into working again. I've not played GW2 on it, but some Blizzard games in HoTS and WoW and both games had this happen. Not good when you're trying to PvP on a team and have to drop. In WoW, I'm just doing normal PvE and this happens.The computer runs stupid hot, I've never had my other do this at all. I had read about it, but figured it was an exaggeration and nope. It's also loud. LOUD. Like I thought the computer was going to just eat it right there loud. It's fine while surfing the web and even Photo Shop, but any kind of gaming just sends it (and me) into fits. I would say the keyboard thing will happen a few times a week. Going to have to spring for a fan to see if it helps, but I may just go back to my old RoG and use this on the couch for trivial things. SO disappointed, ASUS.March 24 update - Have a fan for this damn thing and it still overheats. At this point I might as well try a block of ice underneath it. The keyboard still stops randomly and it happens without a high graphic load now. It makes my headphones cut out once it gets hot and has rendered two pair (one old set I replaced as I thought maybe it's just time and then it did the same to the new pair about 2 hours into gaming and no one in discord could hear a full sentence) This thing is built for gaming, so why all the damn problems? I'd have been better off buying a $900 laptop at this point",0
Laptop itself is good and no major issues but the screen quality is poor. You have to look straight so the picture will be fine.,0
Good quality. Good for entry level to mid level gaming laptop. Able to run Gears of War 5 without any issues.,0
"I have been running strictly off a Chromebook for 6 years. It was fine for my needs. I run D&D and other TTRPGs online, and it never missed a beat in all that time. However, more and more the tools for online gaming are vastly improved. I want to be able to use the map building, and other VTT tools that require I download and run software.So I finally broke down and bought a windows device again. The added benefit of being able to play PC games again was a bonus, and omg, this thing is fantastic. I run on max settings and it just flies. Every game I play is beautiful and fast. No temperature issues at all, and yet it is quiet as a mouse. Even the keyboard is soft and quiet.If I have any issue at all, it is the battery life. I am thinking about replacing it, as I can barely get 3-4 hours of usage off power. And that is just running web pages like Roll20 and Discord. Not heavy gaming. I only use the proper charger, but the battery life sucks, even when I am not using it. Just carrying it in my bag, I will lose 10-15% battery. I am used to my chromebook that goes for 8-10 hours, so maybe I am spoiled.If you want an affordable gaming rig, this is it.",0
Just know that if you buy this laptop that you will be limited on what you can do. The most this laptop is good for is surfing the internet. It's also very small and I didn't realize that until it got here because I was so desperately in need of a laptop but I am sending it back.,0
Fue una buena compra. La laptop de HP es muy ligera y puedo llevarla a todos lados para trabajar. Fue buena compra.,0
"Works fine, but can be a little challenging connecting to peripherals.",0
I requested a change and the msi support service was horrible the whole time.,0
"Excellent laptop. Use in college. I love the long battery life and how quick it is. It also has a very comfortable keyboard, which is great when writing papers.",0
"I should have gotten more memory. Get at least 500 gig, this is more like a tablet than a laptop, but is fast.",0
"This is my third chromebook, purchased only because my second chromebook needed to be up dated!. Set up was very easy; no problem transferring all of my files. Definitely a 5 star item, highly recommended!",0
I had the old version of this notebook and it was to TIME to UPGRADE it and YES i got me the newer versionit is FAST to check my e mails and YouTubethe price is NICE AFFORDABLE and the color is nice also I had the silver and now I got the black notebookyou wont regret it and if your package is being deliver by SLOW the brown oneexpect it around 7 pm or LATER the Post Office is FASTER,0
Great laptop love it.,0
"The GS75 is a very powerful laptop that is surprisingly light weight, it has strong build quality and it look good to be honest.",0
The chromebook arrived without a power cord for the charger. Vendor must not have a very good quality control program since this is basic to the operation of the chromebook. This also indicates that this is not a new unit since Dell would not have omitted the power cord.Amazon support provided a credit to cover the cost for a replacement charger.,0
"This gaming laptop offers a great gaming experience for a amazingly affordable price. With all the tech packed into this beauty, I'm surprised it didn't cost hundreds more. Used with a 144Hz 27"" HD monitor, it really shines and provides a much better gaming experience than my Xbox ever did. I don't know about battery life since I have only used it plugged into the power supply so far. Still surprised I got such a powerful gaming laptop for such a relatively low price!",0
"So far ,so good, meets my needs",0
It's good for quite a few games RAM and memory could be better though along with battery life (depends on what you have running) and it cooks my crotch kinda.,0
Came clean and easy to set up and works for what we wanted it for but there are 2 issues:1) the touch pad does have some dead spots2) the battery is getting old (made in 2012)It's not the fastest lap top out there but is good for everyday browsing and email.,0
It arrived fast and works perfect out of the box. Worth the money. It wont disappoint. Upgrade the ram and itll be a bit better. Ahem less than a year and the fans click so loud about to drown this machine in the tub....,0
Business and work!👍,0
"Upon arrival the laptop powers on but has a black screen. Ive tried to restart it, hard reset it, plug it into a monitor, etc. The screen was dead on arrival. As for the packaging, the seller put the laptop box inside a giant hollow amazon box with no padding at all. The laptop probably rolled around in the giant hollow amazon box for 2 weeks before making it to me with a dead screen.",0
Everything runs so well on the pc. Such a steal!,0
I use this as a tower stand in. The chassis feels cheaply made compared to my last MSI laptop. Over all performance is 8/10. Not bad but nothing really stands out.A good deal for the price. Some hot spots on the screen but they're hardly noticeable while in use.Over all 7/10,0
Everything expected and more.,0
Excellent product,0
"Not “set up” friendly, too many passwords, less app friendly than our last Chromebook. I should have been a more careful shopper. Pretty screen images and sharp color.",0
I bought this for college and as well to replace the use of my desktop computer. It is large! The power supply is bigger than any laptop I have ever seen. It is a bit heavy as you would expect when you put it in your bag with a couple of books but not so much that your back will be hurting by the end of the day. Ive loaded fallout 4 and all of the mods I could think of on it and it runs without a single hitch. One of my favorite features is the button that turns up the fan speed on demand. The body seems to be made out of a durable brushed aluminum. It doesnt feel cheap or flimsy like most other laptops ive used.Cons are minimal. The touch pad is a bit too close to the keyboard so when typing I occasionally hit the touch pad.It is my opinion that this laptop model has the best features and performance for the money and I am so happy I went with this one. Look forward to having a powerhouse for gaming in my off time and something reliable and strong enough to survive being knocked around in a backpack.,0
Overall a decent laptop for work mainly using web browser to complete my task. The battery never really held a charger longer than an hour and after three months it didn't hold a charge longer than 10 minutes. After five months the laptop won't work unless plugged in.,0
Good value good product,0
Great quality for the money.,0
Will not remember my passwords and requires me to sign in to sites that I have already signed in to again and again. wifi is fast and thats good.,0
Me llegó en muy buen estadoLa verdad un buen producto,0
"Brought this chromebook about a year ago. It all the computer I need for what I do. It is quick, battery life is good and recharging is fast. Touch screen works well. I do use a mouse, mostly because it is my preference. Only problem with the touch screen is I have problems closing out tabs with touch - maybe my fingers are too big? Overall I love how easy it is to use.",0
"Received my laptop yesterday and it is very nice, easy to set up. Very big! Only this morning did I notice the trackpad is off center from both the screen and the keyboard. Not even centered under the space bar. … Transitioning from a more rational design where things are centered makes it difficult not to continually right-click. Yes, this design is clearly visible in the pictures, I just didn’t notice. If this is a deal breaker for you, now you might notice! As for me, I’m sure I will adapt in a few days.",0
It was easy to use and connect and add apps.,0
"Computer was good, except it was listed as new and I got a used one with someone else's email account still active on the desktop. Nice case.",0
"Laptop is great for the purpose for which I purchased it. Starts up quickly. Battery life seems adequate so far. Don't set your expectations high on screen quality with this machine. Resolution makes a difference, so just keep this in mind when evaluating your options. Overall, nice machine for the price.",0
"For the second time in recent history I've had two very expensive deliveries made to my home by Amazon shipping. Both of them stated on my order, ""Your package was delivered. It was handed directly to a resident."" Both times this was not factual, my front door has a sign requesting all packages be delivered to the back door, it was ignored. Thankfully there were no problems with this order.",0
It's a bit noisy,0
Dont buy it bad quality !!,0
It's upright firing speakers have superior sound quality to its competitors as well.,0
The only issue I had was a constant blue screen. I updated my firmware and drivers and never had that issue again,0
I really like it,0
"I am genuinely thrilled by this computer's speedy boot-up time, it's practically instantaneous! But, when it comes to the battery life, it's a whole different ballgame. It’s utterly frustrating to have to constantly worry about carrying my charger around. I long for the day when they will incorporate a regenerative power system that uses the computer's heat or even kinetic energy from typing to charge the battery.",1
"I love Samsung its lightweight and very functional, sound and visual quality exceeded my expectations.",0
The keyboard and track pad are both comfy and work well.,0
"So far so good, I played a couple of games (warzone, kena, tales of arise, resident evil 7, nier replicant) and no issues. The main thing will be the fan noise but I'm use to it. Maybe getting a cooling stand will be an option.",0
Keyboard keys have decent travel and is easy to type on.,0
"Ordered this to replace a 7 yr old Windows 7 laptop that was at it's upgrade limit. The family friend that uses this laptop lives in the country where internet is almost non existent. Needed something that could run for a relatively long time on battery, but was still easy to use. Windows 11 image used allowed setup without a Microsoft account which was helpful for the aforementioned lack of internet. Had to adjust the settings to move the start button to the old location and had to do some training on the differences when coming from Windows 7. Overall a nice laptop with a nice track pad and screen as well as battery life. Was nice enough that I am considering ordering another one for myself.",0
"AL inicio todo bien, con el uso normal, ni siquiera forzado, se bloquea apagando el monitor y sin apagarse calentandose, hasta forzarse con el boton a apagarse, tarda en prender nuevamente por el calentamiento previo. Lmantablemente ya no entro en garantia y ahora tengo que buscar otra solucion.",0
"La pantalla es delgada, pero es una lata, porque está muy endeble y no soporta mucha presión. La mía tiene una raya negra horizontal a lo largo. Hay que tratarla como a un bebé. Eso no es bueno. La batería pierde la carga muy rápido, no dura lo que ofrece la publicación. Además, no me enviaron garantía del producto.",0
the screen hinge that raises the back for more air,0
Excellent screen quality!,0
The computer stopped working after five weeks. Amazon refused to make their vendor Samsung stand behind their inferior product. Don't believe Samsung's 90 day warranty as in reality you have no warranty. Samsung's products are so poorly made that they can't afford to warranty them. I would look elsewhere.,0
"A decent laptop, but see others with better specs offered from big box stores for the same price or less.",0
Thank you great product,0
"I use this mainly to download and read the local paper, read e-mail, and surf the web. Does all of the tasks very well. If you're looking for a general purpose laptop, I'd highly recommend it.",0
Decent computer for the price.,0
Liked everything. Nothing to dislike so far. Updates were quick and smooth. I think my favorite part is definitely the TouchPad with the fingerprint sensor.,0
Amazing laptop amazing shipping just 4 days across the globe amazing building quality amazing performance and most of all amazing prices highly recommend you won’t reject itA little bit of screen bleeding but not as much maybe i was lucky with my model as i see others have more screen bleeding cooling is amazing in this laptop even left it run overnight for few days with no problems runs games so amazing and it’s so fast will update if any issue came up it’s been a week of using it hard so far so good so great,0
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is the worst computer I've ever owned. I am returning it immediately. Setup was easy with Cortana, but slow. It took forever to boot up just to start doing anything. Launching the internet felt worse than dial-up. The internet application (Windows Edge, I think) froze while typing an email, and I had to restart the computer. I had a full wifi connection - so it was the application - not my internet speed. I used it for less than an hour and was so frustrated that I started the return process with Amazon (on my wife's MacBook Pro). It's taken over an hour to only complete ""3% of the factory reset"". I only completed setting up my mail account on this laptop, nothing else -- so the restoration to factory settings should only take seconds. Do not buy this computer.",0
It has a large number of ports,0
The windows button is nip picking. No points taken off. It's just annoying.,0
"All things considered I think this is a great laptop. Unfortunately, B came off within two days of use and there’s no easy way to fix it. Not a huuuge loss but does speak to less than stellar workmanship. Thankfully b is not as frequently used letter in my vocabbbulary .",0
Great laptop plays bordlands 3 medium settings at about 90 fps and the same for doom(2016) could probably up settings to high and get a steady 60 fps,0
The font on the keyboard is also not the most aesthetically pleasing thing in the world.,0
"It lasted 3 months. Horrific customer service, returned for repair twice, still overheating and blue screen right out of the box. Dell says it’s too old for replacement or refund. So, I have a very expensive paperweight. Do NOT buy. Save yourself the expense and the hassle.",0
Form function and performance are terrific,0
"The screen is very good, very wide viewing.",0
"This is a great product. I've had a couple of HP towers, and this Chromebook is very fast and responsive. I would buy it all over again!",0
very light and easy to move around while being built well,0
"Shern S. After some time passes it gets hot and when it hot it gets cranky!I mean CRANKY! I no one wants to stop what they are doing and shift grears! .That is annoying! I say it is ok, because I am still learning how this machine works.",0
Works great!!!,0
"I must be one of the exceptions. This laptop, the HP 15-BS158CL series, is worth every penny. I have never had an HP before, but it seemed to me that the company was reputable. With the excellent reviews given the i5-8250U Quad-Core processor by independent testers, I gave it a try. I am not disappointed and have not had any problems at all. It is extremely fast, arrived as specified, and runs like a well made Swiss watch. I have not encountered ANY of the problems detailed by other reviewers of the same model. I could not complain if I wanted to.",0
Strong in small package,0
"This is a great laptop, but the description lies about a couple of details. The USB C port is NOT a 3.2 (meaning it doesn't support USB C charging-- this was sort of important to me so that I can use my phone charger for my laptop too). Additionally, the wifi card does NOT support Wifi6 (802.11AX).",0
I liked how the keyboard is and how fast the laptop is for gaming I would highly recommend it for people how have money to buy it.,0
A good school laptop.,0
Never seen a laptop with such a flimsy connector for the power supply. The port itself has been bent inside and literally have had two connectors snap off with very little pressure applied. Worst laptop design I've ever seen.,0
I purchased this laptop as a like new used machine. It definitely looks new and more importantly performs like new. Couldn't be happier!!!!!,0
The graphics card speaks for itself in many ways and lives up to the expectation,0
"I bought this product because of the brand new description, but the didn't come in its original box and even the charger is an off brand. The laptop is not touch screen. I've had it for 1 week and it had a software update that took 4hour with the screen stuck at 100% update done. I wouldn't recommend it at all, I'm returning it.",0
Its lightweight nature and slim profile make it the perfect travel companion. An in-built retractable privacy screen could further enhance its usability in public spaces.,1
1 year and 3 days after purchase. This chromebook (which sucks~ its basically a glorified smartphone) decided to conpletely break down. I will NEVER EVER buy another Chromebook. It has been nothing but horror from.the beginning.,0
"beautiful laptop, powerfull, slim. not like their phones lol.",0
"Es, a mi parecer, la mejor laptop que se puede comprar a ese precio, según crucial se puede ampliar la RAM a 32G lo que la volverá un monstruo!",0
"The battery monitoring module died around 5 months, the computer was unable to be turned on unless plugged into the well adapter. Lenovo customer support was great and quickly repaired. However, one day after using it from getting it back from Lenovo the fan died and the computer began to over heat. I'm glad this isn't my main computer.Updated: (3 years later) Don't buy this computer. It's too small to handle the heat of the I5 7200U in it. The performance is just awful when it shouldn't be with having an I5. The terrible performance is due to the lack of proper cooling. The fan is very loud and runs full speed at idle. Spend the extra few hundred and get a surface pro.",0
Good speed,0
DOES NOT HAVE A BACKLIGHT KEYBOARD,0
"Maybe hardcore gamers can nitpick this gaming laptop, Lord knows youtube is filled with many opinions about it (this review is for the US version...apparently corners were cut in some markets resulting in a performance hit), but after a month I can say that I think I nailed it on price vs. performance after days of research and given my sub $2000 budget. It has the requisite 16gb of RAM and the 6gb of ram on the 3060 future proofs it for a few years. (I almost fell for the 4gb 3050ti...don't do it). It is very expandable. I immediately added a 1 TB NVMe drive and found it easy to open the case and install. There is room and supplied adapter for another SSD beyond that, or you can take that spot over with a larger battery. RAM is removable. I am not a hardcore gamer so I am very happy...haven't found a game or tech demo that the 3060 can't do at least 60 fps at ultra settings. Most older games run around 120-140 fps. Build quality is not up to par with the higher end business laptops I am use to, but it is not far off. This was a very good buy at $1200.",0
Do not buy from this seller the computer was defective and I returned it and after 3 months of contacting them I am still trying to get my refund.,0
personal use,0
"This Chromebook performs exactly like my wife's older refurbished Samsung Chromebook, which is why I bought it. I had hoped that doubling the RAM would increase performance a bit, but it seems to run exactly the same. Which, to be sure, is great, I had just hoped for something slightly more agile. I would buy again, especially at this price. Excellent for Facebook, email, and video streaming. I mainly use it for online shopping and casting to my TV via Chromecast.",0
very easy to use and fast!,0
"The speed is great. It is light and does everything I need. The missing delete, home, end and other keys means that I have to work a little differently, but not much.",0
I went everywhere attempting to purchase this MacBook. I couldn't even get it from apple since there's no in-store purchasing .. I was able to find and recieve within 1 day via amazon. As for the laptop itself Wonderful ... If you're considering I highly recommend.,0
"The internet here works as fast as a macbook.The computer holds very much info and never loses it.I have not have problems with it.However,it is very small",0
"We've had the Chromebook only a short few weeks, and already we're having problems with it. The Wi-Fi keeps on cutting out, and refusing to reconnect without a restart. A Chromebook without WiFi is pretty pointless. Looking to return.",0
"Really good for the price. Got an Amazon Warehouse used ""like new"" unit and it was indeed new. For $852 a gtx 1050, i7 and 16gb ram on a laptop is a solid deal. Works well 2 weeks after, will update in the future.",0
"Arrived next day, perfect condition. Thanks alot!",0
After 2 weeks of heavy use playing Diablo 3 and counter strike l can say that this machine should be able to handle anything you throw at it. With a cooling underneath the temperature for both the CPU and GPU never went above 43 C. Frame rates consistently above 60 fps. My only con is the screen is sometimes a little dark. When gaming keep it plugged in. Only about 75 minutes of use before you're at 15 percent. At 1600.00 I consider it a good investment.,0
"I bought this laptop both for school and casual gaming and I’m very pleased! I’ve always built my own desktops to spend less for better parts but needed a laptop for school. After looking at some in the $500-$700 range I found this one and after a look over and reading some reviews I decided to buy it. I managed to purchase the Nitro 5 9th gen for $600 + tax. (Sale) decided to get another 8gb of DDR4 and a 500gb M.2 for all my games. The storage that comes with the laptop is more than enough for school work especially with most files being in the cloud. I got a crucial 8GB DDR4 2666 SODIMM for ram and a WD Blue 3D Nano 500GB SSD (which I have installed but have yet to set up)With both of these upgrades the laptop runs great! Now that you know a little about what’s been done to the laptop and it’s intended use (in my case) let’s jump into some pros and cons after 3 weeks of use.Pros:?Good specs for the price?Easily upgraded?PLENTY of ports?Runs great?Full keyboard (takes some getting used to)?Not too heavy?Easy to use temperature/fan software?Good battery life when on power save?Good quality on the webcamCons:?The bottom of the screen is a little flimsy?While gaming the CPU runs 74°C-80°C which is a little hotter than I’d like but to be expected in a laptop?Does need to be plugged in for peak performance but the same goes for all/most laptops?Charge port is on the right side of laptop towards the middle which can be minor inconvenience when using a mouse?Not a huge fan of the red but beggars can’t be choosers and at least it was done well.?Took about a week to come in IIRC but no biggieAs you can see the cons are mostly just nitpicking little things I don’t particularly care for. That’s because overall I’m very happy with this device! There are just some minor things but not at deal breakers. I usually don’t bother with writing reviews this long but I know there are people in the position I was in a month ago. Love the laptop so far and don’t think you will regret your purchase! Unless you get a bad unit, which I can’t speak on because I got a good one. I’m sure ACER is more than willing to replace faulty units. Hope I was able to help with your decision! Best of luck in your laptop search! Will update with any issues or new findings.",0
It is extremely fast and quiet.,0
"Quality was weak, flexible in areas it shouldn’t be. Mine had sound issues where if the laptop was tipped sound would go out and sound bad. Also if you pushed in the middle of the keyboard or by the speakers it would go out as well. Returned for refund.",0
Love this laptop! Apple has always been very user friendly with setup. Amazon had the color I wanted and the fasted delivery!,0
Keys feel great for typing and gaming,0
Fine for what it is but cant put many programs on it all online only.,0
"I just received my helios, I ordered the i79750H 1660ti, 15.6 inch 144hz with a 512 g m.2 ,16g ram rgb option. PH315-52-710BI did suffer from windows crashes upon first sign in. I would HIGHLY recommend doing a fresh install of windows when you receive this laptop, instead of going to a bios flash. It has run super smooth ever since. I did buy it for school/work/casual needs. The main games I have played on it are Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege. They ran flawlessly and the framerates were great on ultra settings. It is highly upgradable with an extra m.2 slot and hdd space.Will update months down the road to see what changes may have come up.",0
"My wife and I both teach and have 11-year-old twins. Together, we have used four Acer laptops, an entry-level Nitron that has been going strong for 4 years; a top-of-the-line Triton 300 with 32gb of RAM and an RTX2080, which has given me outstanding performance for almost 3 years; and a 14-inch Acer Swift 3, in the home for a few months. All perform admirably for school and teaching, including Zoom meetings.Now I am reviewing a mid-level Acer gaming laptop, the Predator Helios 300, with an Intel Core i7-11800H, 16gb of RAM, 512 SSD, and an Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU.It arrives smartly packaged with a black sleeve for portable use. The first thing I noticed is that the chassis is built like a tank. I squeezed it with my thumbs and it felt solid. The membrane keys are typical spongy laptop keys on keyboards. I prefer mechanical keyboards with clickety clack blue or, in the case of Razer, green keys. You’ve got two USB ports on the left and one on the right if you want to hook up a mechanical keyboard. You also get an HDMI on the right if you want to hook up to the monitor. The power port is on the back in the center, a very logical choice, which I like.Set up was a breeze, took about 20 minutes, as I logged in with my credentials, and used Google Chrome, downloaded Spotify, and checked my settings for volume and mic.As you would expect, the Acer boots up quickly and gives you a racing sound. Also for a gamer laptop, you’re getting an aggressive grill in the back of the monitor, which conjures images of a race car grill.I turned on Netflix and watched a documentary on mushrooms and the images were excellent. The sound, even at full blast, was only mid-range, and when I opened Spotify and listened to some electronic pop (“At the River” by Groove Armada), I couldn’t get any loud sound, so if you’re looking for an immersive gaming experience, you’ll need to buy some external speakers. However, the sound is not cheap and tinny. For whatever reason, Acer didn’t tune these speakers for loud sound.Internet surfing, Netflix watching, and software downloads did not activate the fans. So far it has been quiet.You're getting 352 nits of screen brightness, which is good at this price point.Overall, this laptop is a joy to use. It handles Zoom meetings easily. While I’m not a gamer, I prefer gaming laptops for my Zoom instruction because gaming GPUs can handle all the Zoom updates. As my engineer friend explained to me, hosting a Zoom meeting is similar to gaming in terms of technical demands.If you’re looking for a tank of a gaming laptop with an RTX 3060, bright screen, and don’t mind using external speakers when you want to crank up your volume, I can give the Predator Helios 300 a strong recommendation.",0
"Was looking for an inexpensive Chromebook because I was really looking for web browsing and I was really tired of windows 10. I was going to return this item and order a larger screen but I thought I would give it a try. Great little computer that does what I need it to do, which was surf internet etc. Good price as well.",0
"Great screen, surprisingly amazing speakers, unparalleled speed and battery life.",0
the windows update function was set to be off for some reason,0
"Aorus 15 does look and feel a little bulky, weighing a little over 5 pounds and nearly measuring at 1 inch thick.",0
Excelent delivery and product,0
"This is the first gaming laptop I ever owned, although I have owned about 6 other laptops previously. This is a great gaming platform with just a few cons.First, the Pros: Nice sized display with high resolution and a clear, bright display. Sound is incredible in quality, although the volume is very low. Keyboard is crispy, and the backlight can be dimmed or brightened or turned off. Touchpad is responsive although I prefer to use a wireless mouse instead. WIFI has a good strong signal and connections are quick and reliable. Plenty of ports, and built-in cooler makes this a well rounded player. Upgrades are easy to do, and with 2 NVME slots plus a 2.5 drive slot, you won’t be hurting for storage space. The memory can be upgraded to 32GB if you need it.CONS: just a few, and none are deal breakers for me. The first is the weight. Not sure what it is, but this is no lightweight. It’s hefty!! Second, Acer went for some fancy design with the case that has the corners chopped diagonally. It’s not actually sharp, but it can be a bit pokey if you’re balancing it with one hand on your knee while battling behemoths in Dauntless. That’s pretty much all I could find to say negatively.All in all, this is a great laptop at a reasonable price for the specs. It will definitely stand up to whatever you can dish out in your favorite games.",0
love the laptop. got it for my 9yo son for school and ofcourst gaming. he loves it and so do i.great price and produt.,0
Surround sound DTS app in the Armoury Crate software using a headset/earbuds sounds fantastic.,0
Not having good luck with keeping the WiFi running as others have noted. Still working through some troubleshooting. Will update this if I find a fix.,0
So far so good!!,0
Arrived safe and sound.,0
There was an issue with the power cord in the original shipment. The issue was handled promptly and resolved easily.,0
"31 days of use. Only 1 game installed and mostly used for school for my 13 yo son and this is what happened to him in the middle of playing a game. Vertical lines down middle of the screen. He saved for YEARS to buy his own laptop and was SO careful with this thing because it was it life savings. Called Lenovo Ultimate Support, they said someone would get a hold of me in 3 business days. Never called me. I called back and they said the part was on order. Had to call again about 2 weeks later for an update and they promised someone would get a hold of me the following week with an ETA on the order for the new screen. Nothing. On a chat now and am told the parts are not available! This is NOT Ultimate Support. At this point, if parts are not available, send me a new darn laptop. It's 31 days old!!! This should not be happening to a brand new laptop. They also said they have never heard of this happening....but so many reviewers are saying the same thing. They even tried to blame it on us dropping it! VERY UNSATISFIED with Lenovo.",0
Nice laptop. Runs well after the updates. My only complaint is the win updates took over four hours. That's with a good internet connection.,0
"This Laptop is incredible. If you're a gamer who has a budget, I'd definitely recommend this laptop. It's light weight, has a very good amount of batterry life, and can run most games at 80-120+ fps (at least from my experience). The Laptop looks nice and has a nice slim design. The fans are a bit loud, but it's easy to deal with when you're gaming with a headset. Overall, this is a great laptop that anyone could enjoy playing on. It'll also make a great gift.",0
touch screen has yet to worksame for backlite keyboardno inst manualfast but not outstandingken,0
I am not computer savvy at all. I got this computer all set up within 5 minutes (probably less).It has everything I need for a home laptop.And it uploaded everything from my google account.Very happy.,0
I use this product for work and it is great i have not had any problems with it,0
I wouldn't waste my money on this lap top for the following reasons. You don't have control over certain actions. It has Black Outs where it will just goes black then pops back up. It downloads whether you want them or not. NO TOUCH SCREEN. Had I saw that I wouldn't have purchase it. Its cheap very disappointed.,0
"This is the best laptop within this budget. Super smooth, fast and low noise. Asus is also giving warranty extension of 90 days for giving feedback of the laptop. That’s great!",0
They responds with their generic emails and never answer my question or help me.,0
The chrome book is not what I was looking for. It works great and is a little slow. This is more for a child or teenager. It doesn't have the capability I need.,0
Reason for the 3 stars. I’ll tell you. I bought this for a friend who needed a computer to set up a ovh. (Vpn). Unit worked great for the first few hours!! One issue. Would not charge. Ordered a new charger hoping it was the charging unit. No luck. Now I’m going on week 2 waiting for my return credit. :/. $400 stilling in limbo Amazon! (Hahahaaa),0
"Keyboard is impossible to get used to.I work in IT and I have used every laptop imaginable, from MacBooks (worst keyboard) to Dells and Lenovo.The keyboard layout here is just stupid. it's so bad . I pride myself on typing on ANHYTHING, but after six months I am still not able to use this as a laptop - it's basically a weak desktop for me now.The issue: the entire QWERTY letters are pushed to the left for give room to the numbers pad (as if they had to economize size here - the laptop is a tank no one is carrying this around), with no support, so you are left with a narrow are for typing, lots of room to put your right hand while your left hand is suspended in the air.Add the bad keyboard to the practically non existent battery life, the fact that it's extremely heavy and a charger that's heavier than my other laptop - and you got basically something that's not really a laptop .",0
"This was a nice Laptop when it was working. went to use one day and will not power on, Did all the online troubleshooting and still not powering on.",0
Love this awesome product,0
"A lot of these reviews talk about the low refresh rate and how it’s was advertised to be 144hz. The refresh Rate 60hz, but on valorant I had a solid 300 FPS on high graphic settings. I would read the other reviews before buying but so far the laptop is running great and is built very well, and is VERY PRETTY. This is also my first gaming laptop so I wouldn’t know the best, but if you are looking for a well-built medium price laptop, this is for you.

"This by far is one of the best laptops I have ever owned. It is robust and well built. The display is bright and crisp. The touchscreen and S-pan is right on. The keyboard is great. Its fast. It has google play store now which allows you to use android apps. In my opinion this was the deal maker for Chromebooks. Before you could use real (non google) apps they had limited functionality.IMO this is the pinnacle of evolution in terms of light-use mobile computing goes, I've been looking for something like this for years. Samsung did a GREAT job with this.The only drawbacks in my opinion is that the battery life is not great. It is much better compared to a traditional windows laptop, however, I used to have ASUS chromebook that would stay charged for weeks when idle and like 10 hours when I was using it. My experience with this chromebook is maybe 4-6 horus. The bigger issue is that the battery discharges quickly when not in use. I'd be okay with it if once you started using it you only had 4-6 hours, but it is a bit annoying to charge it up, wait a few days, and find that it down to 20%. I would ask that SAMSUNG addresses this...maybe its a software thing burning up battery in the background?Otherwise great machine. Its kind of aesthetically pleasing too, seems like the went for the macbook approach in terms of styling. I do wish that they offered a premium version with aluminum instead of plastic.",0
"Everything I used was perfect. So why 3 stars? I used it and worked OK. When I needed to unplug it once, and travel, in less than 90 min I had to look for a plug.Why do I call it a laptop?",0
"After 2 weeks, this nice looking computer has performed as fast as advertised. I have been working with heavy Excel files but no gaming. Well worth the price for a 17"" laptop with an Intel i5 chip!",0
I will give it some more time I guess but am really considering sending this back. I can't believe how crappy the screen quality is. My 5+ year old fire tablet has better video quality than this thing. The last laptop I bought was in 2010... is it a requirement now that you need to spend $1000+ for anything decent?,0
"The used laptop was in good condition. Everything works. I’m happy with this product, thanks amazon!",0
"Holy c$%p, this laptop is a steal for what you get. It's an ASUS, it has a 10th generation i3 chipset, 8gb RAM and an M.2 hard drive. It needed a little tweaking with advanced power options bc it was glitching. The internet browser was freezing but changing power settings fixed it.. There are Youtube videos on ASUS viviobook lagging and you will find tips to remedy this. 5 minute easy fix that plagues most computers from the factory. This laptop is an amazing deal especially for the price and it would still be worth it if it was 500.00. The only negative to this computer is that the speakers are tinny and you will need to use external speakers if you use the audio frequently. Still...its a great laptop.",0
Gave to Grand kids for Christmas and they were playing on them in 15 minutes. They love this little unit and I can't believe the price for the quality!,0
Great screen and graphics,0
The Laptop I bought is marvelous!,0
"Asus makes a good product but I prefer the Notebook over the Zenbook except I ran out of memory. Zenbook is bigger, faster, more memory, runs hotter and costs more. Why does Zenbook use a bigger SD chip that sticks out the side of the computer than the Notebook using a micro SD that remains hidden?I've had the Zenbook for 3 weeks but used it only once. I'm typing this on my Notebook because it's more convenient.",0

"I was overall impressed by the quality of this laptop. The gaming performance was admirable for the specs, and it felt like a good build. However there are several obvious and some not so obvious tradeoffs.First of all, the 3050 Ti that I tested is an interesting choice. With 4GB of RAM it limits games from otherwise going into higher qualities. DOOM Eternal for example, outright tells this to us. If you have the choice I would recommend skipping directly to the 3060 option. However, I will also comment on how this particular configuration works.Let's get this out of the way, anything lightweight or older will render at 120-144 fps range even with maximized graphics options. For example, CS: GO was going for over 300fps. That being said, let's look at some modern games.Battlefield V is a good game to test different graphics options. It came at a time of DirectX 12 transition, and various options give wildly different results. For example, you should forget about enabling ray tracing. The only way I could get good FPS was enabling resolution scaling at 50%, and one can imagine the overall loss of quality at that option. Actually one should forget about ray tracing with *any game* with this GPU.That being said, for Battlefield V DirectX 12 renders much better than DirectX 12 in game (45 fps vs 55 fps average on ultra quality 1080p). Dropping quality one level will take you to the 60 - 70 fps range. But of course the engine suffers from ""micro stutters"". Even when the game is running at high frame rate, it would drop significantly every now and then. It is really jarring.The game that solves stutters, and runs butter smooth is: DOOM Eternal. It is a technical marvel in engine quality, and easily can in the high 120-144 fps range with ""Ultra Nightmare"" settings. Except for texture quality, which is maxed at ""medium"". Yes, I tried but it won't let you go any further with the limited 4GB RAM. One that that does not work is DLSS, it drop the gameplay to about 30 fps, which is not acceptable.The way they achieve this is with a heavy dose of dynamic scaling. It will fall down to 50% sometimes, but that is only when the gameplay is already crazy fast, and I would not notice it while focusing on the daemons.(Personally I found the gaming performance somewhere between a Series S and the PS5/Series X consoles).The WiFi performance was also pretty good. Without too much moving around, I was able to get over 800mbits from the router.The machine is cooled well, and does not drop in performance when run from a battery. (Of course you need to change the power options to enable that). My concern is the lack of charger portability.The laptop is very picky about the charger, even though it actually charges at 90W, but uses the overhead for active gaming sessions. However other chargers I tried did not work, and type-C, unfortunately is not supported.The lack of proper type-C implementation is unfortunate. Even at 60W, a standard charger would let you carry the laptop only, and not to lug around another large brick.Also it lacks Thunderbolt capability, at least it would not work with my dock, but uses type-C USB. That not only limits future expansion with a eGPU, but it also limits resolution of external monitors on that port. Basically even 4K 60Hz HDR was not working. (The separate HDMI port is of course more capable, this would be more for multi-monitor setups).Another limitation is the lack of the second NMVe expansion port. I have added a closeup photo of the motherboard section. They went all the trouble to design the port there, but did not bother to actually solder it on. This is a major issue, since modern games take a lot of space. After installing 5 games, one of them Solitaire, the internal SSD (512GB) was more than 75% full. I would otherwise add a second one for games. And this would also help with OS reinstalls, where the game dirs would not be touched.A software thing that bothered me was forcing the use of ""Windows Hello"", when the device did not support a required webcam or a fingerprint reader. Getting rid of this is possible, but annoying.But I should commend hp for using standard screws, easy to remove back cover, use replaceable RAM slots, proper cooling and overall nice keyboard to go complete a good package. I might be listing some negatives, however for what it is actually supposed to be doing (gaming) it does it real well.",0
"Full disclosure, I bought this in used-very good condition from Mytrix.This laptop was blazing fast and played Witcher 3 on ultra with no hiccups.. for about 15 minutes until it crashed. I’m not sure what caused the crashes, as it would happen while performing menial tasks such as using Word. On and off charge. I’m bummed because it seems like an awesome machine. If feels sleek and powerful. Unfortunately though, the consistent and erratic crashes make it unusable.I hope yours works.",0

"We opened it up to install RAM (it runs happily with 40 gigabytes!). I have never seen a cleaner, more straightforward design. Truly elegant, complete with a way to replace a range of components (including the battery). The machine works flawlessly - powerful, fast, and capable. I supplemented it with an external keyboard (I like more throw), a good stand, and it also drives external monitors.",0

Dead 6months later. Do not buy this laptop if you want it to last more than a year. I actually own two of these. One that I bought from target in 2018. This one died 1 month ago after I had purchased the second one from amazon. I had assumed my amazon purchase was a new unit. But checking the serial number now to make a warranty claim revealed it was also a 2018 unit. So two of these computers died at just shy of 2 years of life. Not a well made or reliable product. I’m extremely annoyed about my second purchase that resulted in only 6 months of use time. Do Not Buy this!!!,0
"I've been looking at and watching the price on laptops with similar specs, when I finally found this one and the price was significantly less for similar specs. On top of that, the fan can do all of the work on it's own, which I've never found possible with a gaming laptop before. It can get pretty loud though, if you're looking to keep it cool and quiet, you'll need to get a separate fan or something to sit it on. When it comes to the actual computers performance, it comes with some great software to help with any headset you plug it, customize the sound, and tinker with how you want your laptop to feel. MSI is a great brand, this is the 2nd time I've purchased one, and this one is a power house for a great price.",0

"We bought this laptop for our church, for teaching hybrid classes. We assumed it would have a flash drive port, and that was important because our teachers bring their lessons on a flash drive. We had to return this item, which was complicated because it came from a third party vendor. We returned it to Amazon immediately, but months later they sent it back to us saying that they cannot accept the return. We had to figure out how to return it to a third party vendor. Not impossible, and the vendor has been helpful, but it sure was more complicated than I had hoped.",0
I love how lightweight it is.,0
"I have model # 14-DF0023CL, the variant sold at C*stco.The performance components and screen are better than expected for the price. But the chassis build quality and keyboard will remind you it is not designed for heavy use. It’s just fine for non-business travel - a much more functional device than a tablet, for those having higher requirements than web browsing or video watching. You can do real office work or photo editing.Of course, “S” mode can be disabled so you can install your favorite Windows 3rd party applications, instead of being limited to the ones in the Microsoft Store.The reasons this low cost machine stands out from its peers: 1080p IPS display, Intel core i3-8130U processor, upgradeable꙳ M.2 Samsung PM871b SATA 3 SSD drive, upgradeable꙳ DDR4 RAM. Unfortunately, all the common user-serviceable components; such as battery, RAM, and storage drive; are accessed by removing the entire bottom cover꙳.꙳ HP service manual warning: For authorized service providers only. But the adventurous reader having a guitar pick and screwdriver can figure it out at the expense of voiding the warranty.There are 2 memory slots, slot #1 is occupied: Samsung DDR4-2666 M471A5244CB0-CTD. This one is 1Rx16, in case you want to add a matching 2nd SO-DIMM for faster dual channel operation.There is a 2.5” SATA drive bay, but no cables or drive caddy are provided. The M.2 slot supports either SATA 3 or PCIe 3x4 NVMe drives.I upgraded the M.2 drive to a Mushkin PCIe NVMe. Disk benchmarks are attached. While the serial transfer rates are exceedingly fast, the 4K random [low queue depth] are the more important values to consider for common work scenarios. The original Samsung PM871b is actually quite respectable.With laptops, I like to test drive myself. The keyboard action and certain display characteristics are hard to evaluate from specs and reviews. This machine’s keyboard is just acceptable – the layout and size is fine, but the hardware quality is marginal, making it difficult to accurately type quickly. The touchpad works well enough. The screen is very glossy, which is problematic in some work environments, but otherwise I think it’s good. The graphics card does a fine job of driving my external 1440p monitor via HDMI.",0
"Updated review with more detail [after 2 weeks]. ** See additional note re color.I switched to Mac 11 years ago, and for that entire period, I had the same laptop, a Macbook Pro, late-2011 model. After the initial adjustment, it has been a great laptop for all of these years. I used it for school, work, online browsing, a few applications, and streaming videos. I have never gamed on my 2011 laptop. Of course, it slowed down considerably after several years, and software and hardware updates can only help so much with an older model. So, I finally decided to purchase a new laptop, and based on my research on recent macbook models, the price and value was right on this 2020 Macbook Air.GENERAL FEATURES: Switching from a Pro to an Air model is weird at first because the Air is SO thin and lightweight. It has an extremely slim profile. I have to be extra careful when I grab the laptop to move to another room. Like other reviewers have said, the screen extends almost to the edge with minimal bezel, which also means very minimal border, so you are getting a ""larger"" screen. I did not mind the thick bezel black border on my pro and have been used to it for so long, but I took for granted that it actually provided a lot of protection for my screen. The macbook air has almost no bezel, which in my opinion, is not ideal. Let's hope it doesn't drop or get off balance because there is basically no protection for the screen. My older macbook pro has fallen a few times on it's corner or edge in 11 years and been fine, aside from minor cosmetic damage. But the larger edge and bezel came in really handy on the macbook pro when it lost balance and fell off the counter several years ago, but I quickly saved it by grabbing it by the screen and significantly reducing the impact when it landed [luckily not on hard floor]. Obviously not an ideal way to grab it, but it was a necessary save in that moment. The only damage was cracks through the top of my screen from the pressure of my palm, and some minor dent in the bottom of the laptop. Cosmetic damage, but thankfully did not effect the screen light, LCD, or anything else. I do not think the macbook air would survive this, especially how the screen is built.BATTERY: Upon opening the box, the battery life was already pretty high, and I decided not to charge it until the battery decreased to around 10-15%. I was still using my original macbook during the day for work, and the new macbook air during the evening for mostly online use and going through all of the system preferences and settings, and watching youtube in the background. Keeping that limited use in mind, I did not need to charge it for maybe 1 week. Great battery life thus far. I will likely be shifting to use this macbook air for work soon, in order to take advantage of the current OS, higher ram, and M1 chip, especially because I connect to virtual servers, which can take a toll on the ram and processor.SPEED/PORTS/BLUETOOTH: Compared to an older model pro, it has good speeds so far. I already knew that the number of ports have been reduced significantly, and that air has less ports than a pro anyway, so I purchased a thunderbolt adapter and a USB hub in advance to take care of that issue. So far, the thunderbolt adapter works fine to connect the macbook air to my Thunderbolt Display monitor. The bluetooth was able to connect to my ear buds, although pairing did take a bit longer than I expected. The bluetooth preferences do seem to be less detailed/less options than my previous macbook pro.CHARGER: ** In my opinion, the previous magnetic chargers were superior to the current ones. They attached via magnet, the indicator light was red while charging, and green when fully charged. Easy and convenient. The mag-safe charger on this computer requires an additional push to be plugged in fully. This is just like most electronic devices, so it is not a bad feature, just requires an adjustment. It is probably safer for the computer and prevents it from easily coming unplugged. However, there is no indicator light, so you can't tell that it is plugged in and successfully charging unless you look at the battery status in the menu bar, and you also cannot see when it is finished charging just at a glance. You cannot confirm when the laptop is closed or on lock screen. You have to open the laptop, log in, and then check. Big bummer. **MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES: My previous macbook had a great feature: check the battery life at a glance with a quick push of a button while the laptop is still closed. After some additional research, I realized that apple removed the battery light indicator on the macbook pros many years ago, and that airs never had this feature. Big bummer. There is no way to check the battery life on this model without opening the laptop AND logging in, as the battery status in the menu bar on lock screen only shows the icon, but won't show you the percentage until you log in. Not ideal at all.-------Quick review for recently purchased product [during Black Friday]. I will update with a more detailed review once I have used it for a longer period.***** Important Note: If you are on the fence about purchasing the ""gold,"" don't get it. I had a silver MacBook Pro for many years, and I went back and forth for several days about the gold, especially after reading recent reviews and viewing customer images on multiple retailers that said the gold is closer to rose gold. I would disagree and say that the color is actually better described as dark blush pink or dark a reddish-mauve. Definitely not the look I wanted to have, and I regret not purchasing the staple silver, especially as I keep my electronics for many years beyond the 'normal time.' It would be a hassle and a lot of money to purchase the silver instead, since we cannot exchange in-store.",0

"Words can not describe how amazing this laptop is for the money. I used this laptop to complete several engineering projects/labs using MATLAB, created dozens of scalable web applications with databases and servers, and learned how program with this laptop alone. I’ve had this laptop for about 4 years and it is still running strong. I used it for basic functionalities like writing essays for my English courses, taking notes for chemistry courses, working on group projects through zoom, and having fun on YouTube or shopping on Amazon. I also used it for more advanced work like creating programming projects, writing thousands of lines of code in Java, JavaScript, CSS, html, used back end servers and databases like sql + nodejs+ express js, used it for my calculus 2-3 college courses to solve complex problems with python, and many other things. There are days where I crave the extra computational power and speed, but I can never forget how great this laptop has been to me. When I only had $300 to my name during my college days, this was the furthest that my money could take me, and I am grateful till this day. Unfortunately due to the nature of my career path and the increasing intensity of my projects/courses, it is time for me to upgrade. The reason why I am vouching for this laptop so hard is simple: I’ll be starting a career in the tech industry soon, and my job might be very lucrative. While I was at my lowest, money hungry corporations like apple were selling me $1000 tinfoil laptops that I could have probably made in my backyard with the help of 3 Homeless dudes, a $30 budget, and some aluminum foil; While acer offered me an amazing deal for just $250 at the time.So yes, this laptop is worth the buy! I can’t say this is a great gaming laptop or content creation laptop for YouTube , but if I was able to complete some intense coursework with this laptop, than so can you. That being said, here are some cons about it. Although the pros will always outweigh the cons.Cons: poor speakers,Poor-decent battery life,Decent video quality,Ugly laptop,",0
If you want to waste your money and scream at a computer - then this is your computer. I waited a year to write a review to make sure it was the computer and not me. This computer is HORRIBLE.

"After looking at most of the gaming laptops available for $800, this is by far the best mainly for the 512 gig HD which is twice as large as all of the other laptops in this price range. After playing many games and having multiple programs running (multitabbed Chrome, VLC playing movies, whilst also playing games which I shall list shortly), I find that only having 8 gigs of ram (and of course the 4 gigs of video ram), this laptop has very little stuttering/lag while switching between said programs. I was pleasantly surprised at how great it performs with only 8 gigs, that I might not even bother with getting it up to 16 at some future date.The only downside to this laptop that I find after nearly 4 weeks of use is the battery life, because playing a game with only a battery would at best give me an hour and a half of uptime. But honestly, who buys a gaming laptop expecting to play games without it being plugged in you know what I mean? If you need battery life, look elsewhere, but for everything else, this is a great bargain for around 800 US.Below is my list of games and the performance I got with this laptop with mostly max settings:Elite Dangerous - 80+ fpsRome Total War 2 - 100+ fpsNo Man's Sky - 100+ fpsStar Wars The Old Republic (on station with hundreds of players) 120+ fpsCivilization 6 (DX12) 70+ fpsPlayer Unknown Battleground 100+fpsI have to say the 1650 GPU combined with the outstanding Ryzen gives magnificent gaming for such a good price. For 1080p gaming you really don't need anything better. As far as plugging this into a 4k tv/monitor, I wouldn't know, but I plan on doing it in the future if for anything to play some more forgivable games and I will update this review for when I do. But for now, I highly recommend this laptop.",0

"I love this laptop. I am using it mainly for my school work, I do full time classes at university and some are online. I needed something light and fast that I could travel with. If you are looking for something that is a powerhouse laptop at this price point you are fooling yourself. I am surprised I got this good of a deal on a laptop with a SSD in it. I bought this laptop with the mindset that I wanted something that was fast and could do a light work load because I have a powerhouse gaming Desktop PC at home, so I did not need something over the top in a laptop. I also wanted it to be light for travel. If you are looking for something that will run High FPS Games or Adobe products smoothly I 100% don't recommend this PC. This computer can handle simple games, I like to play My Time at Portia and it can run League of Legends, but most potatoes can, so it's not a gaming PC by any means, but you need to check the Games themselves and see the lowest setting you can run them on (Like you should if you are a gamer and wanting a new laptop).The size of the SSD is not the greatest, so if you do not use things like Google doc's that save to the cloud you will be wanting to get an external drive or an SD card. I believe you can install a HDD on here, but am unsure and do not plan to myself. I have a 1TB external drive for if I need to move files between computers and as a general rule of just having my files backed up to several places.Pros:- Boots up in seconds- Runs smooth for everyday light use, Internet Browsing, Watching Youtube, Hulu, Netflix- Plays some games that don't need high graphics cards or processors- SD card slot so I can extend storage if need be- Has an Ethernet Port and a HDMI port if you travel and want to put something on the bad hotel TV'sCons:- The Bloatware, so dumb and useless- No others right nowAgain my review is based on this product at this price point. I didn't expect this PC to run a graphics intensive Game, I would never expect a 400$ laptop to do so. I love that it came with an SSD, the storage is fine for my needs as I mainly use Google Docs for school and have an external drive. I have had no issues with the Wi-fi on the laptop as of yet, I do not expect to. If you are looking for a laptop that will offer you speed and be a great travel companion if you are in college or travel for work, you should get this one.Last thing I do recommend installing a fresh version of Windows 10 so you don't get the bloatware, or you can just uninstall the bloatware through Programs and Features. Up to you, but the bloatware you will get with almost any new Laptop.",0

Will be nice if you can charge with USB-C to allow for smaller charger when traveling.Very happy with purchase and highly recommended.Disclaimer, I am receiving a 90 day warranty extension for my feedback.",0
Very pleased,0
"El video muestra claramente cómo es que el paquete llegó vacío sin la chromebook, es un robo una completa estafa por parte del proveedor, si llevé a cabo un gasto de esta magnitud es porque realmente necesito el producto y lo más pronto posible.",0
Love my new laptop,0
No touch screen. No batter life. Also 'non genuine' copy of windows on the computer.... In order to have actual windows 10 it will cost 200 dollars from the Microsoft store to get a product key. Never buy refurbished from amazon again. I instantly regret it.,0
"I bought a certified referbushed but it must have been like the display model from a shop when I set it up it had a wierd setup process and strange certificate codes from like 2011 im retuturning getting a newer model of chromebook , I suppose you get what you pay for thought a found a good deal since all chrome books are good for is browsing web but this thing is not up to date",0
when i received the laptop it was packaged brand new. i've only had this laptop for a week now and it crashed the very next day i got it. thought maybe i was just on too many windows but i literally only had chrome up and league of legends downloading. i have downloaded steam but the games won't launch. this laptop net framework had errors so i could download directx to play games. now the keyboard back light is not working. everytime i reset the computer i get the asus system program screen. the performance of this laptop is terrible. this shouldnt even be 900. i feel like this is a 400 laptop. i did not think i would have this much issues already. planning to return this,0
"It is small enough not to weigh you down, large enough to have a realistically sized keyboard, and the screen is excellent for writing, blogging or watching Netflix. It is aluminum cased and that not only looks good, it is light weight and sturdy. I am impressed. Good quality for the cash.",0
"After used one year, the keyboard is gone. ""D"" key does not work at all.",0
The computer works great however the USB ports do not work. Computer does not detect devices plugged into ports.,0
"I wanted to replace my old macbook with something that wouldn't break the bank, and this seemed to fit the bill. No regrets at all, as it is a fantastic, light little laptop. Everything worked fine out of the box. I've had it for a few weeks, and have been using Office on it mainly, but also Photoshop/Illustrator/Indesign. I tried streaming video to a Roku and it works well for that as well. I haven't experienced the problems that others have reported with the trackpad or fingerprint reader - both are working fine for me. Battery life has been adequate, but I'm not using it as a primary work computer. The fan can get noisy when doing processor-intensive tasks, but for web browsing or lighter tasks it is mostly silent.",0
After 2 months battery won't hold chargeNow it won't turn on at all,0
It came with an illegal edition of what was represented.,0

"The M1 chip is amazing and a miracle, this little chip can play some of the most cpu demand games around cities skylines it played phenomenal without any lag or freezing. This MacBook Air is very powerful. the downside to it, is that it doesn't have a cooling fan and one cooling fan in it would make a major improvement.",0
"Most products work well at first. My HP laptop lasted a few months before the hard drive died. After a repair, it lasted another 6 months. Now the keys are falling off. Contacting and dealing with HP technical support is an adventure. I am still under my extended warranty but have decided that it makes more sense to buy a laptop that I can count on. It will not be an HP product",0
"Awesome laptop! Super light, super fast, and touch screen to boot! Love it!",0
"I was looking for a laptop with at least nVidia 3060 for a long time. Most of those I found were with a GPU that had reduced power. Well, not this baby! It is a venerable BEAST! I downloaded and installed all new drivers (including BIOS 1.07) and it works like a charm! Anything I threw at it worked flawlessly, full resolution and high/ultra settings.Highly recommended!",0
"Great laptop! Quality, fast start up, great screen, lightweight w great battery life!",0
This thing is a beast. I love it. I bought it based off of positive reviews and this community was right. The fan is loud and battery life is low but that's expected with a dope azz lappie top. I would recommend this bad Barbara to anyone looking for a rad lappy.,0
The way the hinge jacks the back of the machine off the surface its on seems to give something in there like a bottom-firing woofer a little room to work.,0
The screen is great,0
"It's only 1080p, but the refresh rate is 144Hz and it looks extremely smooth just doing regular things like browsing the web or watching videos.",0
"Not the fastest, not the most perfect, screen quality seems to be on the lower end, some RGB is off, speaker also not the best, but happy with it so far for it's price. Totally ok for doing some light work on google drive. Battery life is good, best thing is I can use the quik app for gopro control.",0
"The computer is fine the way it is. The battery life is ridiculous though. Sometimes, my laptop only lasts for like 2 1/2 hours and I'm not even doing any type of gaming. Just normal stuff. Quite honestly, I regret getting it. You are literally paying a little over $900 for a computer that will die on you. I also hate that it gets dirty easily. For example, the smudges on the keyboard. The design on the mouse pad thing could have been better as well. They should have added a button or something where you can disable the mouse pad, that way it's not randomly clicking while you are typing something on the keyboard.The performance is great. I just wish that it had better design and the battery didn't die so quickly. Of course, if you want a better layout, you have to spend a little more money but tbh, again.. there are other designs out there for the same out of price or less that has the same specs and performance as this. You are literally paying for the name ""MSI:.",0
I purchased this laptop as a replacement for my old laptop that was in sad shape. I took the 1TB SSD disk out of my old laptop and put it in this one (I had to purchase a SATA cable specific for this model) When I turned it on it booted Fedora 34 detected all the different hardware and runs like a champ! (I used the 128GB it came with for virtual machines) I never actually let it boot into windows (Thankfully!) however it runs Linux like a champ!,0
"The precision of the touch screen on this computer is quite good, but I can't help but wish for a 3D holographic display that I could manipulate with hand gestures, like in those sci-fi movies.",1

Purchased for my 14 y/o son to do schoolwork while on the road for soccer. Very easy to set up (he did it with no assistance) and easy to use. Great value!,0
"Super fast shipping! I ordered at 1am and it arrived at 7:40pm the same day, I selected free 2 day shipping so I was pleasantly surprised. The laptop worked just fine straight from the box. I just turned it on and signed in to my Google account. It's very simple to use and fits my need for a school use laptop. I love the selection of Chrome extensions and apps. I'm in college and also use this for homeschooling my daughter. I use Google classrooms, which works great on this Samsung Chromebook. It's fast and user friendly. I have an hp desktop I use for gaming and other heavy duty stuff. This laptop is perfect for on the go lessons and homework. It is refurbished, but looks new and works like new.",0
"I bought my XPS 13 in late 2018. This is my fifth Dell computer. I'm a full-time writer, so in the spirit of full disclosure, I should say that I'm on my computer at least five to six hours a day. The battery lasted a year and a half. I was going to replace it, but shortly thereafter one of the screws that held the monitor hinge together broke (a quick Google search told me this was a common issue), and the keyboard lifted off. I had a computer repair person glue the housing/hinge back together, and that fix lasted for about six months. Now the keyboard around the on/off switch is completely loose and raised up about a quarter inch. I once again took it to a computer repair place, and he suggested that I not spend money on fixing it as any repair wouldn't hold. I truly believe the problem with his computer is that it's just too small. It's a shame because the operating system and keyboard work just as well as all the other Dell computers I've purchased. I expect to get three years out of my computers. All my previous Dells have held their own for at least six years at a time. This one started to mess up after the warranty expired. Take away: No more 13"" laptops for this writer.",0
"Every thing works in Linux. When I got it I first tested on Linux live OS and checked all the drivers. Then after testing for a week I decided to commit to it. First I wiped the Windows OS which I never use and made the Linux OS perminant. Then I properly assembled the unit with proper thermal paste on processor and added thermal tapes on other components. Now I get 16 hours on Linux while my laptop always stays cool, quiet and stable. I charge my laptop once every 3 days or 4. Excellent laptop but you have to fix it once it comes messed up. I had to do the same to XPS 15",0
"Very little sound, often headphone is required. Performance/speed also not as expected.",0
The battery holds a charge of only 1.5 hours while watching a video. Slows down very often buggy during robots in Photoshop.,0
"Beautiful screen and playing video games on it is smooth for the most part. It’s very lightweight and keyboard has RGB, great for light to medium gaming, great for school, powerful enough to do most you need.",0
This laptop is the best! So light weight and easy to carry around. Battery life good last pretty long so glad I bought it!!!!,0
"El producto llegó nuevo en su caja, pero al igual que otros que comentan aquí, la pantalla tiene un defecto: le aparecen de la nada rallas horizontales, como cuando se está dañando el flexi o tiene conflictos con la tarjeta de video. Sea lo que sea, no esperas estos defectos en una computadora de 20mil pesos core i7 de 8gb ram. Lo que mal comienza, mal termina, por eso, antes de que estas rallas empeoren, prefiero regresar el producto.",0
"The laptop is a beautiful,super light, and user friendly. I can multi task during my live lecture,take notes, and have my ebook open as well. If your looking for a light and simple laptop this is a great choice. The display is great as well. The only thing is there are no VGA ports so you will probably need a HDMI to HDMI depending on your connections on the monitor. Also there is not a ethernet port if your wanting a direct connection. Overall I am super satisfied with my purchase .",0
"I LOVE THIS COMPUTER, fast and really quiet, the RBG keyboard is a plus. So grateful I was able to upgrade to this!UPDATE: It's been nearly 1 year since I've received this computer and it still is a 10/10 for me. The performance is great, the sound is fine for a laptop, and I have had NO problems with it at all. If you're looking for something reliable this is it. My only ""complaint"" is that it looks a bit bulky but with the performance it gives I really don't care.",0
"I bought this laptop at the end of March of this year, without having used it much until recently. It required Windows updates as well as driver updates. A few days ago, when I went to boot it, all I received on the screen was a ""Republic of Gamers"" logo. I restarted it multiple times, and received the same thing every time. There is no way to access BIOS, and now I have a nice $1500 brick. I will be contacting ASUS tomorrow to get on with my warranty, and will update as the process goes along. To say that I am less than pleased with this product is an understatement.Update 7/29:The SSD failed and was replaced. I've had it for about a week and haven't had any issues so far as I can tell. The warranty process took a couple weeks and if it was my only computer I'd have been far more upset than what I am. I will continue to use it and give a better review after I've had it for some time.",0
"Like the title says, the laptop is fast and works great. I installed more RAM into it which was a little difficult initially due to removing the bottom but now that it's been done once, it shouldn't be an issue to do again once I install a new SSD into it.",0
"I love the laptop, including the sleek look of it.",0
"When the fans kick on FULL blast, wow it is loud.",0
"I've had the laptop for 8 months. I use it for daily tasks as well as gaming, mainly Overwatch. Generally I like it, but there are a few problems:1. It always heats up to 91 degrees when I'm playing Overwatch. I had to buy a cooling system which only makes it go down to 90 degrees. The high temps lead to frame drops in game. from 120s to 30s/40s/50s. When I turn on the AC and point a fan at it the frame drops stop. It's a gaming laptop. Like, come on.2. Usually about once a day either the keyboard stops working entirely or one key will act as if it's being continually pressed, indefinitely. A reboot always fixes these problems, but it's annoying for it to happen on a machine that costs $1600. And it happens a lot. If this happens during an online game, I basically lose the game. Or I lose unsaved work. The same thing happens with the mouse. Either it stops working entirely or it acts like one of the buttons is being clicked repeatedly.3. Maximum 3 hours of battery life.4. Several times the audio has randomly becoming distorted, usually after updating drivers. It makes watching videos, listening to music, and gaming impossible. It stays distorted until it's fixed. I've spent hours messing around with audio settings and drivers to get things back to normal, on multiple occasions.5. The letters on the WASD keys wore off after 5 months of gaming.On the bright side, it's only ever crashed outright once or twice, but you could argue the keyboard/mouse issue--which happens very frequently--is comparable.For a $1600 gaming laptop I don't think the above kind of shit should be tolerated.Edit: the volume on the laptop is also relatively low. At full blast it can be hard to hear clearly certain shows/music on certain platforms.",0

"My son uses a chrome book for school. He had his last one for 3 years with no issues but thought going into high school we would upgrade. Well we have had nothing but issues with it. It won't stay connected to the internet, it runs super slow and now the mouse won't work at all. Not happy with our purchase.",0
"This chromebook is awful. First of all, the charger doesn’t even stay in. Even when I’m level to the group, it won’t even stay in—it only charges if I’m literally holding it into the port with my hand.Secondly, Netflix and Hulu and any other streaming sites don’t work properly. At first, they didn’t load at all. I updated the chromebook twice and finally the videos would load — except, it was SO glitchy. And it’s not because of my internet connection. It’s because of this chromebook. Zoom meetings are also very glitchy and I fear that it’ll crash one day because apparently it’s too much to handle for this chromebook. My last chromebook worked so well with Netflix, Hulu and zoom. That one ate the dust when my dog spilled coffee on it and I thought this one would do well but I was very mistaken. I will be returning this in hopes of finding a better laptop.",0
DO NOT BUY THIS !!! DO N O T BUY THIS!!!! I recieved this product on time with very high hopes. When i opened the box the smaller box (containing the laptop) was ripped and shredded and the seal was broke but because it was referbished i was still hopeful. The laptop turned on the screen was nice and everything seemed nice until i tried to charge it and it wont charge well at all. So i contact amazon to try and get a new one and they cant fix it they can only refund my money.I DONT WANT MY MONEY I WAS A CHROMEBOOK THAT WORKS. very disappointed. Dont waste your money,0
"While gaming, my machine's CPU averaged 90 degrees Celsius which is way too hot in my opinion.",0
item was as advertised. Good seller,0
"This laptop has a LOT of great features. This product would have received 5 stars from me, but it will only get 3 stars because it has a bad wifi card which causes the computer to disconnect from wifi frequently. I connected with Hewlet Packard technical support via chat and received remote assistance several times. So, I spent several hours with HP online tech support, and this was all a waste of time. At one point I was advised that I should reformat the hard drive to see if this would fix the problem. What FUN that was! It didn't work. After that JOY, I contacted HP tech support AGAIN. Every time I contacted HP support, I had to ""reinvent the wheel"" with each technician, and naturally, none of them were Americans, of course. I was finally told that the laptop has a bad wifi card, and so the laptop will have to be mailed to HP for repair. Even with expedited service, it will take at least 6 business days for the repair. I'm not getting any younger, nor is my laptop or the warranty on it. So, if you don't mind inconvenience, frustration, and other misery, then buy this laptop. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and buy a Dell computer instead.",0

"Toshiba Dynabook Satellite Pro C50-J is a high-quality and fast everyday use traditional laptop.CPU: Intel Core i7-1165G7 2.8GHz - 12th generation CPUs around BUT still on the expensive side and i7 11th generation processors still awesome and so fast.Storage: KIOXIA Toshiba Nvme 512 GB SSD - Not the best but not the worst either, This model SSD write and read speed is kinda on the slow side if we compare similar price tag SSDs BUT it is an SSD and it will be much much faster than an HDD.Memory: Samsung 1x16 GB 3200 Mhz Ram - Excellent! Samsung is one of the most trustable brands and they make high-quality memories 3200 Mhz is on the fast side. This is a single 1x16 GB Ram which means if your laptop starts to slow in the future, you can add 16 GB more RAM easily to your laptop and make it 32.Screen: 15.6 Inc 1920x1080 Max Screen Resolution NO Touch Screen and Screen quality is not bad for this price range. Only blacks kinda have a little light reflection from the inside of the screen but I am sure not many users will notice that. Also, for me, no touch screen is the best. Why the world do I need a touch screen laptop? I just do not get it BUT some people like it and even want a touch screen laptop. So this depends on what you like I guess.Case - Material: Hard Plastic but well made and feels goodGraphics Card: Intel Iris Xe - If you are not familiar with the graphic cards, this is an integrated low-profile graphic card and this hardware doesn't use a separate memory bank for graphics/video. Instead, the GPU uses system memory that is shared with the CPU. So that means do not expect to play the AAA games at 60 FPS at all and do not expect this laptop to give you a high-performance video editing experience at all. BUT that is not mean you can not play any game with this laptop. NO, you will not have any issue playing popular games that aren't as graphics-intensive and some old AAA games like GTA V or Assassin's Creed III: Liberation or Baldurs Gate 3 can playable very high FPS. Final Fantasy XIV, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Civilization VI at 1080p resolution and 30 FPS. Even Microsoft Flight Simulator is playable, though only at 720p resolution with low detail settings. Older, popular games like Rocket League, Counter-Strike, and League of Legends easily exceed 60 fps at 1080p resolution and medium or high detail settings. Long story short this graphic card is very acceptable for this price tag.I also put the laptop on multitasking test which is I opened 15 google chrome tabs with some of them playing videos, I opened 5 Word documents, 3 Excel documents, 2 PowerPoint files at the same time, and I move 128 files from the laptop (totally around 2 GB) to one of my SSD external hard drive and laptop handle all of them pretty good. No lag or any weird thing happens.Conclusion: For $899 Toshiba Dynabook Satellite Pro C50-J is worth your hard-earned money. Remember this is for today's date and which is June 14, 2022. In time this price tag must go down and new model laptops will rise. This is how this market goes. Again for today's market HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",0

It has a fast Ryzen 5 2500U APU with plenty of graphics for gaming and videos. It comes with 8GB of DDR4 Sdram and a1TB HDD. Both are upgradable for the future. This is a great laptop for the price.***It doesn't have a touchscreen in case you are looking for a laptop with that feature.,0
I do wish that there was a windows hello enabled camera or a fingerprint reader.,0
"Performs well, and not terribly loud. Marginal gains from overclocking at the expense of a dramatic increase in noise. Display is not quite as bright as I would like for a room with lots of natural light but the refresh rate is a plus. RAM and M.2 expansion is painless, however 2.5 SSD expansion is effectively impossible without finding the proper cable. After calling Acer, they pointed me to a third party that produces the proper cable. Too difficult to navigate their web page so I gave up. I have been through two cables from amazon, and they did not work.It wouldn't be so frustrating if I hadn't purchased this model for it ease of upgrade. I'm sitting at 32 gigs of ram and 1.5 TB worth of M.2. Sure wish I could have a 1TB SSD as an extra storage drive for games I'm not currently playing. COD Warzone alone ate up almost all of the original 512 with the help of windows spyware, I mean bloatware, I mean diagnostic algorithms.",0
Biggest mistake of my life. The computer had problems from the beginning with WiFi. Then it started shutting down just out of nowhere.

"Very light. I was a little worried about whether it would hold up but the ports and screen hinge are still great a few months in. Keyboard layout just a touch different than what I'm used to (MS, dell, etc.) so it took a few days to get used to.Since I use of the USB-C ports for charging and the other for an external monitor, I'll probably look for some kind of dock as a supplement.",0

"I'll start with my primary complaint about this product. Right out of the gate, I was unable to create an account on this computer using my primary gmail account. The system log in does not support my university affiliated gmail account, so I had to create a new account just to get started. Now, many features of the chromebook (calendar, cloud storage) are tied to an account I don't use, and many of my google apps default to that account even in my web browser.If you are fortunate not to face this hassle, you will still find that the chromebook has very little support for anything other that using the web. Software and apps, if compatible at all, are often buggy.Of course, regardless of the problem you face, you can be certain you won't receive support from google. I spent hours trying to get in touch with an actual customer support person (google works hard to convince you they don't exist, but I got a phone number after several hours with samsung), several more hours being bounced around the system between people who said they couldn't help me, and finally an hour with somebody clearly working from a script - after I explained my problem ten times so we could work through all the problems I wasn't having, I was simply told ""sorry, we can't help you with that""The actual construction is lacking as well. I've had this for a few months and already one of the arrow keys sticks.It is light and has long battery - but a cheap tablet will do anything this can with less hassle. If you want more than web browser, buy a real computer.",0
"This is a laptop with a great combination of features and performance at a very attractive price. I play games, but I also wanted a mobile workstation for digital media work - and this laptop is excellent for this. For starters, the screen is really nice. Motion is smooth, color rendition is excellent and the display’s viewing angles give me good flexibility. I use this laptop, and go back to my old laptop - and such a world of difference. Contrast and brightness are great. The screen is an optimum size - balancing usability with portability.Performance is not lacking. There is a “turbo” button which does what it says, but I am finding that I’m not really using it - the default gives me a good balance between performance and battery life. I tested battery life by running digital video editing and compositing tasks and was able to get a bit over an hour with moderate battery saving mode and screen set to stay on. The accompanying power supply is understandably large, given the specifications of the laptop. Cooling is exemplary - there are times when I’m working with graphically intensive tasks that the fan kicks in - but for my needs it’s quite acceptable, and the laptop never gets hot to the touch.The keyboard has a nice feel, and the LED lighting can be left with a tranquil blue or set to other multicolor schemes. There is a numeric keypad - it’s small but still useful. Otherwise layout is fine - it took me a couple of minutes to adjust to it, but it’s good. The trackpad is OK, it tracks smoothly and is a good size. It’s offset to the left in order to line up with the space bar. The laptop comes with plenty of ports, notably Mini Displayport, HDMI and Thunderbolt 4. The computer ships with screws and an interface cable to add a 2.5 inch SSD, and Acer has a helpful online video on how to add it. Sound is OK - it would be better if the speakers were upward facing - it works for watching online streaming media, but there is not much low end.This laptop offers great connectivity, expandability and a really nice display. Performance is better than any laptop I have previously owned. It looks low key (which is great), so it doesn’t call attention to itself - which I like. I can’t really find much to fault here - performance belies it’s affordable price - given all that is included. Having a portable graphics workstation is great.",0

"The Asus Zenbook Ultra-Slim Laptop is everything I wanted.I purchased the 8th gen i5 core and is by far the best laptop I owned for such price.It's very slim, works super fast, and that touch-screen login is just AMAZING.The fan sometimes briefly makes a loud sound you're running too many apps, but that never bothered me.The battery time is by far impeccable. This thing lasts me 8-12 hours depending on the apps I'm using and the brightness setting.The screen is a bit flimsy and not as sturdy as most laptops (as in it kinda shakes when you move it around, but not to the point where it's a flaw in my opinion.)I'm just completely in love with its design and everything about it is delightful to me.",0

The battery life is pretty good - I could bring it to school and use it for a whole day without charging. The only issues I have with this laptop is that the scroll is very sensitive (but you'll adjust to it after a while) and that the laptop speakers are fairly quiet. Otherwise it's decent for what I have to do on a daily basis (e.g., word processor, a bit of light programming/coding).",0

"I've owned the MacBook for almost a month, and everything is working perfectly with the exception of one issue. The battery?life?is awful. I use it for 30 minutes, and it uses up half of my battery. It drains as well when it's not even on, I can close it at around 50% and then open it again a few hours later, and it will be on low battery. Furthermore, the MacBook Pro I previously owned could go around 2 days on a full charge. So Just keep that in mind if you decide to purchase this pricey Mac.",0
The screen is really bright and you can see more definition than either Ace,0
"So far, this laptop is performing wonders. The first game I got up and running was League. Setting up the laptop was easy and there was no need for downloading any extra drivers, just the typical Windows updates. The laptop did have to be plugged in if I wanted my frames to be godlike but that's to be expected. I am content with my purchase and if need be, will edit this post and update those who are second guessing themselves!",0
"The Samsung XE520QAB is not my first Chromebook household purchase (purchased one for my son who is in elementary school three years ago), and I'm a teacher who utilizes Chromebooks during classroom instruction often; thus, I'm not new to Chromebooks. I hope this review helps buyers who are new to Chromebooks or who were skeptical about replacing (or in my case partially replacing) their primary computer (in my case, a PC laptop) with a Chromebook.The skinny (summary): This Chromebook is fantastic! It is fast, has excellent battery life, and can handle the majority of my daily work and personal computing tasks. Another great feature/function is that it communicates seamlessly with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. If you are looking for a mid-grade (most tech vloggers consider this a mid-level machine, but I don't know why because it has all of the bells and whistles of most top-level machines for a much lower price), then this is the machine for you. I would suggest you purchase a case and a micro SD card (I bought a 128 Gb card). However, the 64 Gb onboard storage combined with 100 Gb Google One drive cloud space (free for one year with purchase) should be more than enough space, I like having the peace of mind of having extra offline space available if necessary. I have watched movies and screencast with no problems from this Chromebook. If watching movies or listening to music directly on this device, I suggest using headphones or Bluetooth speakers since the audio from this device does not have a dynamic range. Playing games on this Chromebook in TABLET MODE is great! Games function exactly as they do on my Note 10+. Since I have a Note 10+ and have owned previous phones from the Samsung Galaxy Note line, writing with the stylus/S pen on this Chromebook is no different. I will warn it is very small/slim and will take some getting used to, but it writes extremely well on this device. If you pair this device with web-based apps and apps from the Google Play Store, you should be able to complete the majority of computing tasks you complete on PCs/Macs.**The remainder of this review is just more personal insight into how this Chromebooks completes tasks compared to my current PC.**This Chromebook will probably NOT FULLY replace your PC/Mac... just yet. I use Adobe products for photo/video editing. While there are Adobe apps you can purchase/download from the Google Play store, they do not have the full range of functions/capability of their full-version counterparts available on PCs/Macs. Chromebooks, while this one, in particular, has a powerful processor for its OS, do not have graphics/audio cards that support full range photo, audio, and video editing.Now, if you don't require a computer for advanced functions such as media editing, then this Chromebook is definitely for you! As a teacher, I can complete all work-related tasks such as email, document editing (both Microsoft and Google). I primarily use Microsoft, since the majority of the faculty and staff in my district have not fully jumped on board the Google bandwagon. Both office suites allow offline usage after initial sign-in. I have experienced only minor formatting problems when using Microsoft office on my Chromebook, but its nothing that renders a document completely unreadable or warrants complaints from readers on the receiving end of the documents. If I could wish for one app that would complete my work cycle on a Chromebook, that would be an app to edit my Smart Notebook instructional files (if you're a teacher who uses smart whiteboards, this could pose a problem). Other than that, I can manage since I don't need to edit/create those types of files often.Personally, I use my computer a lot for paper crafting, sewing (embroidery). I own a Cricut Maker, and a Cricut Explore Air 2, Brother Scan n Cut DX, and will purchase a Silhouette Cameo 4 shortly. I have only used this Chromebook while operating my Cricut Maker (you can assume the same functionality for a Cricut Explore Air 2 as both machines use the same app). I will update this post once I thoroughly test the Brother Scan n Cut DX and the Silhouette Cameo 4 (no promises for the Cameo as I don't think Silhouette has an android app for its machines; the Scan n Cut is a mostly stand-alone machine with a web-based app client, so it should work just fine assumingly). Using the Cricut Design Studio Android app from the Google Play store, I was able to complete projects. You can slightly see the vinyl cutouts I made to customize the front panel of this Chromebook in a picture above. I did run into an issue of connecting to my Cricut Maker. I prematurely tried to connect to the Maker using the Bluetooth settings menu of the Chromebook instead of initially connecting within the Design Studio app, which may have led to connection problems. The devices connected eventually, and I have not experienced any further issues with the Chromebook relating to my Cricut Maker.",0
I don't think anything like video or photo editing or machine learning should be attempted on this.,0
Keyboard is soft and nice,0
"This is access to the internet, it is not a notebook computer. But within its confines, it works well.",0
"I was quite intimidated before I bought it as I’ve never owned a gaming laptop. It’s powerful, stays cold, runs flawlessly. Even the fans aren’t even that loud. I’d even consider it overkill for many games. For reference, you’d be running minimum 130 fps at max settings for rainbow six siege. If your hesitant like I was, it’s definitely a safe bet to go with the acer predator.",0
"It has all sorts of different colors you can pick for the keyboard lighting and alienware logo, which was a nice feature.",0
Every thing is good so far,0
Good purchase with discount.Save 200 dollars and quality is the best.,0
Not worth the cost. We struggled with it from the beginning. Our pain points:1. Internet connection constantly turned off/on. Had to troubleshoot multiple fixes manually.2. Laptop freezes up running more than 1 app at same time. Windows SVC also bogs down performance. Hardware is just too primitive to be useful for anything besides web surfing.,0
"Great computer for traveling and gaming. Its' a bit tricky to set the 3060/70/80 graphics card as the default instead of the built in Nvidia graphics chip, but at the end it all worked out.",0
Material is cheap.,0
"The XPS 15 models have been the top of the line for Dell for a few years. This year seems like no exception and Dell has gone one step further with the amazing high resolution screen (higher than 4k!?) and the great build quality that is s step up from previous years.I was happy to see that they went away from OLED screens even though I really like them overall, they really don't work that well for lighter gaming or for color accurate work. They can be very good, so don't get me wrong here, I love OLED's, I just think they have more tradeoffs than you want for a laptop / work machine.This machine and its high specs are nearly perfect. I did upgrade to 32gb of ram and my understanding is that it can take up to 64 gb. (maybe 128?)The bottom panel is a little harder to remove than previous years, but not hard. Look for some dell based videos or a youtube video showing you how before you jump in.I was also very pleased to see a second NVME slot , but disappointed that it didn't come with the heatsink that the stock drive comes with. I guess you will either need to apply your own heatsink material or order another one from Dell. At this price point, those details should be included (IMHO).The machine has all the needed accessories including a full sized SD Card slot.All in all, the fit and finish on the new 15 inch Dell XPS is amazing and the updated / refreshed look is all positive while maintaining a winning form factor / build quality / design of the previous versions.If you are in the market for the best PC / Laptop you can buy, this is one for your comparison list.",0
Im in love with this computer the speed of the ssd is incredible psa i would recommend if you use a lottt of space to upgrade with a nv2ma for highers speeds and also try to get a larger battery the one included its good but could be better having in mind the hardware it has,0
"When I game and the GPU is in fact working hard, the laptop gets VERY hot, as does the power brick. I don’t have a flir so I cannot check the actual temps but it is hot to the touch to the point I worry about the longevity of the components inside.",0
"I have owned this 6th gen x1 carbon for little over a year. I had some random times when the area to the top left of the machine was very hot, abnormally so. I got a stop code error a month ago, and a few hours before that the laptop started to overheat a bunch and run very quickly out of battery. I turned it off and on again and it fixed itself. Flash forward a month, it does it all day long agian but this time it runs itself into auto kill mode. I power cycle'd 5 more times before I resolved the issue, and this time i watched ""speedfan"" and noticed the cores were just fine in temp, it was my HD that was HOT. After the fact, my HDMI nor two type C ports work for connecting to displays, although the power cord still charges the laptop. I think i'm FUBAR, but as of this moment i bought a wireless adapter to try and creating a work around. that is until the next overheat session happens and this time my entire graphics card blows up! haha just kidding, but serioulsy lenovo plz send me a new laptop at this point. I had the screen replaced in December 2018 and now this?",0
I will review the star rating in a day or two after i get sorted out the size of battery overlapping the SSD drive port. I just have no idea if i got lucky or not. Did i get a larger capacity battery that kills the expansion port for a SATA drive? It would be absolutely helpful to have that in the item description.,0
The charger of my newly bought laptop is making incredible noise and I couldn't get any help and they don't send a new one either.,0
Excellent laptop for gaming and everyday use,0
Love my chrome book..its perfect for the small things i need to do for our business...,0
"This 17"" screen is beautiful and fits in the footprint of most 15"" laptops.",0
"What a great deal this Legion 5 is. The display is as good as the display on the back of my dslr camera. I am not a gamer so cannot attest to anything gaming related. That being said it is an excellent choice for programs like Adobe Lightroom, Topaz and any of the Luminar software programs. Before I turned my laptop on I upgraded the RAM to 32gb and added a 2TB ssd for storage. The laptop boots to desktop in 10 seconds which I found impressive for the price. Battery performance is poor to say the least and I keep mine plugged in all the time. By poor I would say 3 hours unplugged is pushing it. This laptop is also Windows 11 compatible.",0
"I bought this laptop for my husband for his 65th birthday. His laptop was 11 years old and was on it’s last leg. He was afraid to buy a new laptop because he thought things had become too techy in the past 11 years but this one is perfect! The screen is crystal clear and the keys are large enough for his big bulky fingers. He plays word games and does puzzles, explores websites, he emails,,spends time on Facebook, checks out his sports, neighborhood stuff, etc… and if he wants to explore more, he can. It’s super fast and stays connected to our wifi with ease.It’s perfect and the price was SO right!! Oh, I also purchased the insurance plan just in case. That too is a great deal and great idea, in my opinion!5 Stars!",0
there are the usual ports you would expect to find.,0
I bought two of these for my daughters for Christmas. They both love them and do everything that they need. Fast shipping and very good price. Very satisfied.,0
"Como lo dije en el titulo, simplemente espectacular, todo perfectamente, el producto llego en perfectas condiciones ademas de que venia bien embalado, muy satisfecho con este producto y el vendedor. (Tras 2 semanas de uso)",0
"MSI came highly regarded by many of my colleagues. So far I am not disappointed.The body feels sturdy, and the screen is beautiful. The keys are a little soft, but sure I will get used to it. The RGB keyboard is a nice touch.",0
This is an excellent Chromebook. I LOVE everything about it. Mine came with a black keyboard. Highly Recommend.,0
i lov it so far,0
"I bought this laptop because i read the reviews and the specs for the laptop looked well. However, a few days into using the laptop i got a message saying that audio service has stopped working and its looking for solutions. This is too soon to have an sound problem, Do not buy this product.",0
"Not sure what happened but everything is great but my touch pad bottom right corner is sticking up, I just had this laptop for a week, I’m thinking sending it back for a replacement. Anyone has this problem. Thanks",0
The RGB keyboard is also beautiful and very responsive.,0
Best gaming laptop. nice processor Intel Core I7-9750H.multi-colored keyboard backlight.a lot of usb ports both sides. not too heavy.Best laptop for that price!,0
"Great build and price like everyone else says, but it comes with its set of problems for sure. The battery life is non-existent, good lucking playing anything except solitaire for more than 45 minutes to an hour. It runs super hot, can only use on a cooling pad or it is unbearable on your skin or clothing. Also after 2 years of ownership, it pretty much doesn't run any games as it overheats usually within 15 minutes, even after running fans on max, with a cooling pad and suction for hot air add-on can not cool it down. Basically have an overpriced chromebook now. So now I need to buy another laptop, will be trying another brand or getting extended warranty.",0
"I downloaded a program that is almost too much for this machine....but it handles it just fine, even with crappy rural internet. It's so lightweight too, but doesn't feel cheap or like it's going to break. It's quick on startup due to ssd and is very responsive. Very happy with my purchase.",0
It's fast and very responsive. Just what I wanted to replace my old laptop. I had a few questions and the J-Tech was very responsive. I would definitely buy it again. Boots in 15 seconds and Word runs in 5 seconds.,0
"The font used for key labels is weirdly futuristic, and at the cost of legibility.",0
Very slow laptop. Hardly used for only 2 years and is now completely dead!! read the forums this is VERY COMMON!! total piece of junk I will never buy lenovo again!!!,0
I purchased this nice little chromebook for a back up. It's made of tuff material and quality parts. Since I'm now on Facebook I use it every day. Easy to charge and keep clean. I'm a Samsung fan and it was an easy getting it shipped from Amazon.,0
Make sure you get the one with the 3060 or higher graphics card. I have the 3060 card in mine and it runs just about every game I want it to on the highest settings with minimal to no lag or skipping.,0
Super slow. Glitches. Waste of money,0
It's a nice Chromebook for the price I paid it does what I needed to do,0
"I haven't purchased a new PC in a decade or more and this is the worst PC i've ever purchased. A PC built in 2018 should be able to play youtube videos without lag.i installed Cog an app to view system info and the CPU and memory usage has been maxed, even when nothing is running.i uninstalled a half dozen extensions. closed all extra apps and the thing still can't keep up.what a piece of poop",0
"I have had my computer only for a week now but so far so good. Windows 10 was a bit goofy setting up. I called Lenovo and they wanted about $70 to have someone help me finishing set everything up. I did a few reboots and was able to do it myself.I’m not 100% sure I would recommend this to a beginner computer user, but I think I would to a fearless computer user.Nice big screen and the keyboard has more on it (than my computer I am replacing) including 10 key pad. My previous computer had a very small computer and was very comfortable for me. This keyboard is a little more spread out so it may be more comfortable for a man’s hands.Anyway, does what I need it to do.",0
No touch screen,0
"This laptop has amazingly good build quality, and is very snappy to use.",0
"After a month of using this laptop for normal college uses, the keys get stuck which creates the backlight look poor. The keys are still pressable, just the backlight looks horrible.Battery life is okay, lasts about 4 to 5 hours for normal uses and some photo editing. Gaming on this laptop isn't recommended unless you want to always be plugged in. The battery life can range from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours before it states you need to charge",0
"This is my second Acer Chromebook. It's lightning fast, easy to set up, minimal connections and no unnecessary hoops to jump through to get it working. Very happy.",0
The computer was defective on arrival. All functions appeared to work except I was unable to insert the micro SD card in the multimedia micro SD slot. It appeared that the micro SD tray was not aligned with the slot in the case. Both the supplier and Amazon provided good service getting the computer and arranging for it's return and my refund.,0
"I'm on my third time using the computer and the 'e' key already fell off, a piece of the clip broke. I've never had this happen with a laptop before. I assume this is a sign of build quality. Trying to find a replacement key for the exact model is proving difficult. Very disappointed.",0
"Compre el equipo para la universidad, y la verdad para lo que lo ocupo, esta excelente ya que requiero tener vario programas algo pesados abiertos.El rendimiento para juegos es bueno, solo que es obvio que no te correrá juegos modernos a alto rendimientos, te pueden correr en calidad baja.en conclusion, es un excelente equipo si tienes planeado comprarlo",0
trackpad is loose and rattles when touching.,0
The build and design quality are exceptional,0
it wouldn't even turn on when taken out of the box,0
Everything looks nice except the TOUCHPAD for my laptop is Not sensible at all and always follow false instructions. It caused weird stuff pop out continuously.,0
nothing like getting a deal from amazon on these latest generation products.,0
The computer was safely packed. It loads fast the only thing is that it dies pretty soon.,0
"There's is a direct problem with this model, the CPU overheats to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, EVEN IF the fans have either the correct settings OR are on high all the time, even with excellent ventilation this model will kill itself",0
"Yo soy estudiante en linea y puedo decir que es un gran articulo, llevo en perfecto estado y funciona de maravilla, la pila no se agota tan rápido como yo pensaba, No se traba, no se alenta, la verdad me gusta muchísimo y la super recomiendo.",0
"Excelente equipo de alto rendimiento, con un arranque del sistema operativo entre12 y15 segundos; cuando en mi otro equipo tardaba hasta 3 minutos solo para el sistema operativo con la misma versión de Windows 10",0
gran producto,0
Great for a busy life.,0
this looks to be an amazing laptop once it releases in June but do yourself a favor and buy it ANYWHERE ELSE but HID for cheaper,0
I love everything about it,0
"Good screen. Good processing power. Absolutely useless online. The wifi adapter drops the signal multiple times a day. Even when other devices in the house are online and the Lenovo says I have a connection it will not connect. The only remedy is to stop what I'm doing and reboot...and this does not always work, but sometimes requires 2 or more tries.",0
Great deal at the time,0
Only thing is that the fingerprint reader probably only has like a 75% success rate.,0
The camera did not work when purchased. Its cheaply made,0
Excelente pc de acuerdo a su costo.,0
"I chose this chrome book because it is advertised as coming with an ssd hard drive. It does not, it has a eMMC hard drive. I am charging it now and have not used it yet, so I have no idea how well it will perform, but I am greatly disappointed that once again Amazon has misrepresented a product",0
"*Actualizado. Aun pienso que es muy buen equipo, muy veloz en el arranque y el audio genial, además de una apariencia simple pero agradable. Excelente para remplazar una computadora de escritorio, si estará conectada la mayor parte del tiempo, ya que la duración de la batería es media (con un uso que considero ""de oficina"", la batería parece durar entre 3 y 4 horas). El ruido de los ventiladores no es molesto cuando no hay calentamiento interno de las tarjetas, pero con juegos, además de que se calienta demasiado (la probé con Civilization VI), los ventiladores encienden a su máximo y da la sensación de que se fundirá el procesador o la tarjeta gráfica. La pantalla es buena, se trabaja muy bien con el teclado y el touchpad exelente.",0
"After a rugged delivery process (Canadian address bad wrote) the package arrive in good shape, the PC works beautiful.",0
once the heat kicks in there will be frame drops.,0
"Had a dell, nothing but issues thanks to amazon customer service to help me get into this ASUS, it’s absolutely perfect, fast, and pretty much does it all from a business standpoint, it’s beautiful and very well made aluminum all the way around! Can’t go wrong here! Thanks again amazon customer service!",0
Like the laptop but the trackpad came out to be defective and Amazon is not ready to replace this item for the lower price which I had bought during the Prime Deal. Hence giving it a 2 star for the worst customer service until now from Amazon,0
I bought what I considered to be a “Rose Gold” MacBook and it’s absolutely beautiful. It works just as well. I’m just Mac’ing away with course studies as well as my business. Now I can work at home or take it with me wherever I go. It’s light weight and the resolution is amazing. So much better than the laptop I was using.,0
"When first got it running the computer was just what I expected and worked fine. The price and specs were a clear indication of how fast this computer would be; so no disappointment there. I purchased this laptop to have something small that I could go online and do school work and write papers - simple browsing and word processing. I even bought a 128GB micro-SD card to load the programs I needed so I would not use up the 32GB. PROBLEM IS, Windows 10 just killed this computer with updates I don't want or need. Best I can tell, there is no way to upgrade the RAM or HD. The thing was utterly useless less than a month after i got it. DON'T waste your money, save up and buy a grown up computer.",0
"Other then battery life this thing is awesome. No complaints, lightning fast, never had a single problem with anything as of yet. Would like the battery to last more then a few hours but it could also be everything I have running on the computer. Overall I would recommend this to my friends and family",0
Genial,0
Me vendieron como nuevo pero es reacondicionado. Lamentable,0
Not what I was expecting but a good machine nonetheless,0
"I received my laptop today and I’m really enjoying it while learning it, the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the speakers are rather disappointing and not as good as the ones on my iPad Pro. I placed the laptop and iPad side by side and the iPad is louder and clearer. Set up took about 10 minutes, getting all of your apps is rather difficult, much easier on mobile devices. The screen is bright and big, watching YouTube, Hulu, espn and Netflix were great once installed. My social media pages operated well, and most importantly the speed in operations is fast as my iPad. Had trouble linking my phone to this laptop but I’ll keep trying, next I’ll test how easy the printer set up is and come back and update my review. But I would recommend this product you just may need some external speakers to get total satisfaction out this unit. Update; connecting to printer was a breeze. Battery life was 6 1/2 hours of continuous play Binge watching Netflix.",0
"Was overheating playing Battlefield V and Warhammer III. Core temps all reached 90s+ consistently but core #2 and 3 got up to 97-100 regularly as well. Also the W key appears to be failing. It consistently stopped working while playing games that required keeping it depressed... In Battlefield V I would stop running and died quite a few times from it. Overall this laptop is very nice, but i cannot believe the temps, I have tried all different cooling profiles, and have always had it sitting on a laptop cooler running full blast as well. And the the w key acting up has me pretty nervous too. It could be software related but i am not taking a chance.",0
it seems as a very nice well constructed unit.,0
Very fast great performing laptop at a reasonable price. The NVMe hard drive is a huge upgrade from my previous laptop that had a SATA hard drive.,0
"El producto viene segun lo especificado en la oferta (sin sorpresas), agrego que si mantiene un excelente control de temperatura a pesar de colocarlo en maximo rendimiento, muy poco ruido; pero considero que para mi necesidad lo requiero con una mejor tarjeta de video y mas RAM.El articulo llego antes de la fecha estimada y muy bien protegido.",0
The computer is really thin and that is what I was looking for a gaming computer,0
"Excelente, muy rápido. Le pienso poner un disco adicional y más memoria, pero aún así como está, me fascinó.",0

It's working for my business so far. Love being able to open apps easy.,0
"Lightweight, bright, excellent graphics.",0
"Love the size of this computer, but it takes an act of God to get the keyboard to work with any degree of ease.",0
"El display es impresionante, sumamente rápido en todo, la calidad de construcción es excelente y el performance en gaming es sumamente bueno, levanta cualquier juego que le pongas, eso sí, no es una 2080Ti, no esperes correr todo en ultra a 4k, pero mueve cualquier juego en medios-altos a 1080p a más de 60fps.la batería no es muy buena, pero no es para nada un factor que me importe, ya que generalmente yo la tengo conectada siempre para jugar.el procesador es sumamente poderoso para cualquier tarea, y hasta el tomacorriente es pequeño y estético.",0
This was a xmas gift for my fiance in philippines. She receieved it with a flickering screen and movies and videos playing with a pixelated screen. Even when using an hd movie that i gave her came out pixelated. Netflix that streams in 1080p also comes out pixelated. Not sure the issue or if it needs a graphics update but this has become a hassle. Wish it came in working condition,0
Awesome. 10 hours battery use with brightness in half. Open a lot of tabs without noticing any lowering in perfoemance,0
Very good laptop for gaming and general use. My only complaint would be the speaker volume is a little on the underwhelming side. Very solid otherwise.,0
"So far, after 5 weeks, I'm pleased. Item is as described... no noticeable blemishes or damage and everything works as expected.",0
"I was able to get 150fps+ on medium settings consistently in Valorant, Overwatch, and COD Modern Warfare, which was a huge upgrade from my old 60 fps laptop. Noise and temperature have not been an issue except when running on the highest settings for a long time. Only negative is battery life, which isn't great, but my laptop is almost always plugged in anyway so it hasn't been much of a problem for me. Overall, great purchase for the money and would highly recommend for someone looking for an upgrade.",0
"LA COMPUTADORA LLEGO UN DIA ANTES DE LO PREVISTO, FACIL DE CONFIGURAR AL IDIOMA ESPA?OL. ES RAPIDA PARA EJECUTAR SOFTWARE DE OFIMATICA Y TRABAJOS EN CASA. SE CALIENTA UN POCO, PERO CON UNA BASE ENFRIADORA, TODO BIEN.",0
Great laptop.,0
Great performer and excellent build quality.,0
Overheated in hibernation mode. One day it wouldn't boot and it was red hot in HIBERNATE unpluged. Who would know? Used it only for streaming less than 2 hrs a day. Apparently a known issue per Acer site.....unbeknownst to be.... first purchase no issues. This was inferior. Contacted seller the offhanded me to Acer who doesn't reply. Seller won't reply. Guess they know. This is a quality and safety issue. It could be a hazard you don't know about. Very concerning.,0

"Wi-Fi wack-a-mole, fix one problem and another pops up, the only game you get to play with this gaming laptop is to figure out why Wi-Fi is not working today, and then repeat tomorrow. If I wanted to be tethered to the internet via Ethernet I would have just got another desktop. Very disappointed in poor performance of a so-called gaming laptop.",0
"Pues con el producto todo bien, la Laptopo llegó correctamente empacada y es justo lo que viene en la publicación. Sin embargo he enviado mensajes en reiteradas ocasiones para que me realicen una factura y no he tenido respuesta. Sigo insistiendo esperando obtenerla pronto.",0

"From graphic speed to processor speed to hard drive capacity, I couldn't have made a better purchase. The Rose Gold is beautiful. This converts to a tablet with the stylus included - it switches without hesitation. It is a bit heavy, but only by ounces.",0

It's such a delight to play on.The only things that I would complain about if forced are; the speakers are not fun to listen to. I choose to connect to Alexa via Bluetooth and play sound from her. The power port is just in a clunky place and although they've tried hard to minimize it, it's still ""there"".",0

"I was so excited when I bought this laptop. I have used Lenovo products in the past - key point past - and found them to be great. This model was problematic from the start. First I had to pay about $100 to get the bloatware removed. Second, the cursor started jumping around whenever I type. This happens constantly. I researched the issue and head read that it is caused by low quality frames for laptops. Third, programs randomly open and close. This does not happen as much as issue two, but it is still annoying.",0
"Like: Metal casing; hi-def screen with very thin margins; runs and starts up fast; back-lit keyboard; light-weight; decent battery lifeDislike: Fingerprint scanner is encouraged during user orientation, but only works 30-40% of the time; speakers are pretty weak, topped-out audio is drowned out by just a little background noise; charger is short",0
"Very fast!The laptop works great, and everything loads super fast. 10/10 would recommend",0
Did not work properly took forever to power on went completely out after 6 months,0
"like everyone else say, you can ear parasite noises from the speakers.other than that, works perfect",0

"I am glad it finally came, took longer then advertised for shipping. Came with everything as advertised. No broken seals.",0
"Was trying to purchase this laptop but multiple listings appeared. FYI, the other listings are from third-party sellers or distributors. Nothing wrong with third-party sellers and if you want to purchase from a third-party seller that is up to you. If you try to go to other listings and go under the ""Buy Now"" buttons, third-party sellers will have a section that says ""ships from/sold by"". This listing does not, so it is sold by the actual Dell store. Also, if you can, buy this laptop when it has a discount. I bought it at an unfortunate time and the price dropped $200 after it shipped. I was able to return it and repurchase with the discount.",0
The display is very good.,0
This computer is a lightweight computer. It runs very well. The keyboard is easy to type on. It does not have a VGA port and only has one HDMI port. Very happy with it. Came pre-installed with a bunch of software that took time to delete.,0
Worked well... For a while...,0
Un computador que excedió mi expectativa a pesar de confiar plenamente en todos los productos Apple.Me sorprendió gratamente al recibir un portable que VUELA y tiene una presentación FANTASTICA,0
"Bought this for my girlfriend because she always rents one from her school, and the ones the school loans out are pretty dated. This is perfect for keeping up with her projects and work assignments. She loves it!",0
Product was great. Runs fast and can handle games. Only had if for a few days and now the screen is black? Keyboard lights up but nothing on screen. I’ve tried turning it off and back on. And tried just waiting but nothing.,0
The labels on the keyboard wont come off and will ruin the whole laptop usage as your hands will stick and it wont come off.,0
Bought to replace my husband's that the keyboard went out on. So far he really likes it.,0
"The graphics on this machine are simply out of this world, making my gaming sessions incredibly immersive. However, the keyboard leaves much to be desired, with the keys feeling mushy and unresponsive. I dream of the day when they integrate haptic feedback into the keyboard, providing a tactile response to every keypress.",1
"I am going to go about this one a little differently. There are tons of reviews and information on the Macbook Air out there. No point in repeating them or disputing them, after all they are someone's point of view. I am going to come at this as a window user and a skeptic.First I heard about the Apple Silicon back when Apple debuted the M1 chip. I think anyone that is being honest has to admit this is impressive. The battery life and performance combo is great. As a windows user who has never owned a macbook and who thought the Macbook Air was unattractive was not going to jump ship over the M1. I do not like Apple's walled garden approach to their products. I still thought the under 1k starting price was impressive for what you get.Fast forward to 2022 and Apple redesigned the Air and updated their M1 chip now calling it M2. I decided now I was going to purchase my first Macbook ( a small sale helped as well).Initial out of box experience was not great. I bought the starlight color because I am tired of so many boring PC colors out there and when taking it out of the box it looked more silver. I have long had a problem with AppleID (using Apple TV+) and had to revisit this frustration again. The update took over 30 minutes (Hello windows). The trackpad was awful to use. Of course there was the whole unfamiliarity with MacOS as well.My second day was much better though. I found how to adjust the haptic touchpad. I became more familiar with the OS. During the daytime the Laptop had a more light gold look to it. I downloaded google drive and Edge. I was generally feeling better about my purchase. Below are my thoughts.Reality: The battery life and performance claims are slightly exaggerated. The battery life is good but to hit this high numbers you have to use it a certain way. Using Edge browser for instance, with google drive enabled does produce a battery life in the 9-10 hour range that is well within some windows devices range. Performance is real though with this being the fastest device to open ESPN website which is notoriously more demanding than most.The build quality is great with a sturdy feel and yet still thin enough. Most of the time it appears with a lot of manufactures you get one or the other (build quality or weight).Myth: The display is really nice, but not any amazing OMG nice. Plenty of other laptop makers have better displays. Also while I thought the 2020 Air was unattractive because of its chunky bezels, the bezels on the 2022 model could still be shrunken on the side a little more. The notch does not bother me in the least.Myth 2: Windows laptops are obsolete? No, there are better looking window devices out there that have better screens and a better design. Also you can find them a good bit less expensive when on sale. The issue is most of them struggle to put forth such a complete package.Value: I know they increased the price by $200 which is a lot without them increasing the base specs to match. I got the base model and I am aware of the single nand performance of the 256 SSD. It is not as big of an issue as some make out and for everyday people (basic computer needs) it is meaningless. I got my model on sale for 1099 total with taxes (sale with pay for the taxes promotion). I feel that is a good price for the specs. What I am not okay with is the absurd pricing that occurs once you add in more storage and memory. This will quickly go up. Just my viewpoint but whenever a non-gaming pc costs more than a powerful gaming pc it is too much. Keep it $1200 or less for this one.MacOS: still learning it, so I won’t say yeah or nay on it just yet, but it is a different animal to windows. I do not like the way to activate the backlit keyboard, as there is no shortcut key, and it has to be activated through a menu.Conclusion: There is a very short list of devices that hit it on all the critical parts of a device and the 2022 Macbook Air M2 does it. My understanding is that Apple keeps their design language the same for a while so buying this model you should not have to worry about a big redesign making this one feel dated anytime soon.Competition: The Macbook Pro itself would be something to consider if you want more performance but the same OS and build quality. Windows has quite a few competitors with the HP Spectre, Dell XPS, Lenovo Yoga, Asus Zenbook, and I am confident the Surface Laptop 5 will be a stunner with good performance, battery life, and 120hz refresh rate.Why is the MA2 a top choice for most everyday people? It is the value of a complete laptop with a good display, battery, design, and performance. Windows has so many choices and it can be hard to pinpoint which one to get, so that makes this the laptop of choice for most provided you are okay with MacOS.",0
"This is the first gaming laptop I have owned. I absolutely love the performance of this laptop, all the games I've played so far it runs with ease. Cant wait to see how the new Intel 6 core 8th gen i7 does with rendering. The speakers are honestly impressive for laptop speakers, witch is really nice not needing to pull out headphones every time wanting to listen to music. I also love the over all look of the laptop. Nothing too flashy just nice brushed metal finish and some red accents.The biggest downside I personally found about the laptop is the plastic underside. It's WAY too thin. It feels like I'm going to break if i push too hard on it with my finger. Would have rather had a slightly heavier laptop with thicker plastic on the bottom or brushed aluminum finish as well.All in all I'm very happy with the laptop and continue to stay an MSI fan.",0
Whoever thought to use this charger was a complete fool. The chromebook charged up the first time we used it and then refused to charge after that. Then the charger tip broke the day after. Used another charger from a another samsung and that doesn't work either. Worst purchase we ever made. I am going to contact Amazon and see if we can return. Disgraceful.,0
Good product and quality. Satisfied overall with chromebook and fast delivery!,0
no teman si la rompe,0
Very beautiful machine! I love this thing so much! I can run everything on high resolution and it stays cool! Love thos machine!,0
this was a very fast delivery,0
the fans work great at dispersing heat and the where the vents are on the back rather the below or on the side are advantageous to the cooling system and I never ran into heating problems.,0
Battery life could be better but other than that I love this computer!!,0
"I rarely leave reviews for any products, but this is one I feel compelled to comment on. Within a few months of using this computer, it became progressively slower and would overheat when running more than 2 internet tabs. After a year, I was no longer able to use the computer for simple tasks such as a Zoom meeting. The battery life is also poor, and currently I cannot use the computer without it being plugged into a charger. I would highly recommend spending your money on a different laptop. I have since had to buy a new computer and I don't think I've ever regretted a purchase more than this computer.",0
"I'm still learning the ins and outs of using a Chromebook, but it was very easy to set up and start using. Using GoogleDocs is limited compared to Word or really any full-up word processor, but I will figure it out soon enough.",0
I really enjoy this laptop,0
I returned it. I had issues with the battery after two weeks of having it,0
Pretty good computer,0
Perfect for school! I am totally love this laptop.,0
"Battery barely lasts an hour unplugged, every newer game freezes up the entire computer.I wouldn't recommend this to an enemy. Biggest waste of money I've ever spent.",0
"I'm not a college trained computer expert by any means so I can't tell you about the different specs or anything like that, but I've been using laptops since dial up was first popular. I've tried many brands in different price ranges over the years to give me experience to fall back on and I have to say that so far, this little economy priced laptop has pleasantly surprised me. It powers on quickly and has been able to handle everything I've thrown at it. That says something because I'm a multitasker and always have a bunch of things going. It handles multiple browser windows open, videos playing or music playing (wear headphones cuz the speakers aren't great) and my favorite writing program all at the same time without bogging. The battery is even decent. On a full battery I made it six hours before I had to plug it in to charge. Not bad. No, it doesn't measure up, head to head, to my other non-Windows laptop, but I don't expect it to. I got it mainly for surfing online, Facebook games, watching videos, and for homeschooling my grandson. All those things it can do with ease. The main thing I miss is a backlit keyboard. It doesn't have one. So what I'm trying to say is if you're looking for a good economy priced laptop running windows 10 that will let you browse the internet, watch a few videos, play simple computer games or homeschool your child, this laptop is a good fit. If, however, you're looking for something to play the bigger more powerful games or do intensive photoshop, you might want to save up and invest in something more powerful. It's a good basic beginner laptop that can be upgraded with more ram and a bigger SSD or HDD if you need the extra space and have the money to spare.The pictures are in low light and better light so you can see the screen is nice but nope, no backlit keyboard. I personally give it 4 stars.",0
"The touch pad is a bit persnickity, it doesn't always respond promptly.",0
"Easy to start, powerful system. At the beginning window's Cortana will help u to set it up, that gonna take around 10 minutes. After everything is set, just update the Nvidia Driver's and Armoury Crate from ASUS website. I tried playing Fortnite, all settings was on EPIC. My previews laptop was with GTX960m, but that one is like 5 time more powerful than it.",0
Watching videos and movies,0
The best way to surf the web. Quick and easy.,0
Fully charged battery only lasts 2 hours,0
didn't have windows 10 loaded so it took me longer to set up,0
"I tried two different types of DDR4 sticks to expand the memory and both failed. It can't boot after installed it, no any display even the logo... pls help advice.",0
Great computer especially for the price of $599. Boots so fast. Not a ton of space if games but there are slots for additional hard drives. I already added a tb hard drive (Sabrent Rocket Q 1TB NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 Internal SSD High Performance Solid State Drive R/W 3200/2000MB/s). I plan to add RAM at some point,0
son loves it,0
nice laptop. fast and gets job done. light,0
"If you are using the M chip for the first time, be advised that many programs that run on intel chips will not work. As of this writing there are no ""work arounds,"" except for iTunes. You will need to have a mouse to efficiently use the interface. And C USB hub will allow access to work of previous versions of the OS. It is very fast machine. The migration assistant did not work properly for me and corrupted the operating system requiring professional repair. It will take some time get used to its new features that I can use. I am not a gamer. I mainly use word processing for educational purposes.",0
"This laptop is amazing! Very portable and powerful. No issues with it at all. I've been using it for Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier Pro and After Effects. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a powerful, thin and lightweight laptop.",0
This was a great Cyber Monday purchase. Works great and delivered on time.,0
My husband uses this daily. It is very fast and he can share and upload real estate docs fast. He went from a windows 10 laptop and he is happy with this model. Very fast and can add a lot of programs if he needs to. I don't know if he will add microsoft office later.,0
"My previous laptop just up and died with the blue screen of death. I had purchased the same brand - ASUS - for my father back at Xmas and he loves his. Super fast, great screen resolution, plays movies and music with great picture and sound, different model, his is a 15"".So I got myself one.This is fantastic! I might eventually add more memory, but what's on here is more than I need. It did come with the 'linkage' you need internally to add more memory.I don't game, so can't answer that question for anyone, and mine is NOT a touch screen (thank god!).Picture is super clear, good crisp colors. If you do graphic design and such, can't speak to that.Sounds are great, no echo or tiny qualities.Screen goes all the way to the edge!!!I don't have a problem with the keyboard color, yes it is just a few shades darker than the keys themselves, but it is back lit which helps. I type for a living so if you hunt and peck to type - this is not going to be for you.The power button over on the top right of the 10-key pad is a nice placement.The way the lid slides under the base gives it just that perfect ergonomic lift that really helps with typing.Plenty of ports for things, power plug is very low profile and unobtrusive (and long!).I surf the net, watch movies and youtube, work in a chat feature (like Teams). Pretty boring. But this suits all of my needs and then some.Setting up the internet was super easy.The only minor minor minor draw back is a lack of CD/DVD component, BUT - you can get an external CD/DVD drive for next to nothing and plug it in with a USB.If you just need a good basic work horse laptop and some extra oomph - this is a sure ticket to get.Would I recommend it for children, college students? Absolutely.Add more memory or an external drive if your college student is working in astrophysics, computer coding or a medical program and you're set!Will absolutely buy this brand again.",0
"I bought this laptop for photo/4K video editing and music production. The price for the specs is crazy. If it's good for gaming, it's good for anything else.Likes: POWER. Scores high on benchmarks. Is fast and snappy in real use. I connected it to my 49"" Samsung Q70R and it ran Death Stranding in 4K on max settings at 70 FPS with DLSS set on Performance.Yes, with V-Sync on, smooth 4K60 is possible on this laptop without turning down eye candy if the game supports DLSS. Without DLSS, it obviously becomes a slideshow, since 3840 x 2160 is a crazy resolution for a modern game even with an RTX 2080 Ti. At 1080p with DLSS set on Quality, FPS get as high as 130s.Dislikes: SCREEN. The black levels are abysmal. It's the worst laptop screen I've ever owned. I thought my 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 was bad. The screen is so thin, just touching the lid shifts the black levels to a greenish hue, and positioning it also causes a shift.The colors are nice, though, and in other than dark scenes, it looks decent. It's not very bright, but it's plenty for daylight use with a window behind. Oh, it came with no dead pixels or bright spots, so that's good! Viewing angles aren't impressive, especially for an IPS panel. I'm so unhappy with the screen, I would return the laptop if it wasn't for the high value, for how gorgeous it looks and how compact it is.Keyboard looks better than it feels. Keys are tight, but could use a more clickety feeling. I'm not into the RGB craze, but I have to admit the light show looks beautiful. My favorite config is Roulette. Mentioning RGB, I built a Ryzen 9 3900X system months ago and the CPU came with an RGB fan. I was annoyed by it at first, but once I changed the stock light show, I can now appreciate how my case is accented.If you're anti-RGB like I was, this MSI laptop has some civilized light schemes. It's not retina-burning lighting. Give it a chance.Battery is just OK for portability when using it for normal tasks. You don't get a powerful gaming laptop with a hexacore i7 10750H and full RTX 2070 to play unplugged from the wall. Makes no sense.Build quality and fit and finish is very nice. It's a budget gaming laptop, but this isn't budget-feeling at all. You just get a plastic case, not machined aluminum.Software-wise, it comes with a Norton antivirus trial, which I promptly deleted. All the other apps are non-intrusive. Whatever bloatware it came with doesn't stick out, but I uninstalled them. I also uninstalled all the MSI apps to rule out any potential funky business/performance issues.It's my first MSI laptop and I highly recommend it. I will revise this review if something bad comes up. I enclosed a few benchmark scores. This thing has a lot of power. It could replace a desktop/tower PC.EDIT - The first thing I did with it was download UserBenchmark just to see how it compared to my Acer Predator Helios 300. The speakers would make a loud popping sound on the Sphere GPU test, invalidating the benchmark and not yielding results.That never happened to me before with my other computers, and made me suspect that it was audio-related, so I stopped and disabled the Nahimic service, and also uninstalled the Nahimic app. That solved the issue and I finally got all my scores.",0
"It started out great, but a week after I got it the operating system went haywire. A powerwash got it operating, but did not restore all functionality. I returned it for credit.",0
"Un equipo muy fluido, agregando una memoria RAM en el compartimiento que trae, un disco duro extra y quitando el modo S (de manera muy simple), queda un equipo para el trabajo diario.El dise?o es muy bueno, cumple lo que promete, el único problema es su teclado en inglés, sin embargo, te acostumbras.En menos de 30s ya estás trabajando con él. Por el precio es un buen producto.",0
"Purchased it, modified it and now it's worth the money.",0
Love this! Bought it for my son and he enjoys everything about it.,0
"My model is this: Acer Predator Helios 300 PH317-52-77A4 Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i7-8750H, GeForce GTX 1060.It is a beast of a machine when hooked up to its power supply, but as soon as it's unplugged, it drops to like less than half its GPU power and locks itself to 30 fps (at least in World of Warcraft), while I get upwards of 90 FPS on high settings when plugged. Dunno if this is configurable but I couldn't find any obvious solution. Other than that, its an amazing laptop, I specially love the screen on this one. Keyboard is a little stiff, and needs some getting-used-to when gaming. I personally have a half-keyboard that I use with anything I game on (see attached photo), so that's not a big issue for me. Also, If you're looking for a laptop bag for this one, you should get an 18 inch bag, because this is quite large for a 17.3 inch laptop. The fan can get a little loud when gaming but not to the point where its annoying. I personally love the overall build quality of the laptop, and if it weren't for that FPS drop when running on battery, I'd definitely give this a 5/5. It comes with a 1TB WD blue hard drive, which I instantly switched with a Samsung SSD, no issues there.",0
I found myself often pressing it by accident when I meant to press the delete key which is right next to it and of a similar size.,0
"not meant to be used as a gaming lap top. it runs off chrome os so that means it is not set up at all like windows. all apps and tabs are on the bottom screen panel, there is no additional number lock keypad in the bottom right corner like you're Originally used to so no high expectations for a singular use lap top. Meant for single tasks such as school with bare minimum task preformance. Though i am impressed with the preformance of such a compact notebook.",0
Screen quality is a 50/50 for me I had a faulty screen and got my laptop replaced....sucks though because it was brand new and had screen issues. Be careful with this one other than that the computer has been great and been meeting my demands. Battery life isn’t great but it’s a gaming laptop so expect it.,0
"It includes so many desirable features, including a wonderful back lit keyboard.",0
good,0
"I read a couple online review articles claiming this machine gives the biggest bang for the buck. Should have listened to the reviewers here who reported slow machines, but no, I chose to favor the positive reviews. When I plugged this thing in and finally got it going, I simply could not believe how it drags. It's slower than the mid-range Lenovo laptop I got in 2011. It's slower than the high-end Dell I got in 2003 (on which I replaced the hard drive and reinstalled W7 - but still, please, it was 2003!). OK, so I knew it would be loaded with junk. I removed what I knew was OK and spent two days researching whether it was OK to remove some of the propriety stuff Acer installed. It's still not much faster. I know how fast it SHOULD be because the very same day I received this one, a friend asked me to help her set up her new Asus laptop - same size, almost exactly the same other specs. Hers was lightning fast, as fast I would expect in a brand new laptop with plenty of power. This may be one of the worst $529 investments I've ever made. My time is worth more than the days I've spent haggling with this beast. If I were more techy, I would have followed the suggestions to reset to factory specs. But since the OS is already loaded with no backup disc, I was reluctant in case I somehow erased Windows 10.",0
"I love the way it looks, the colors, the sleekness. I love the way it feels with the steel screen casing. I appreciate the ventilation. Has enough ports for USB and HDMI. Though I understand the special cooling system is so important and a great feature, I don't enjoy how loud it is and it seems to come on when I do not expect it would. I'm sure that can be adjusted, I'm still learning. I'm not too keen on the big clicking the mouse pad does. But I'll probably get an external mouse eventually. This is my first gaming laptop and I have zero regrets! I love playing with the different keyboard light options. The screen with all of my games, such as Smite, Fortnite, Call Of Duty, and more look fantastic! Thank you MSI and Steel Series!",0

"Update --- I was finally able to get through to Microsoft that I did NOT want their ""S"" version. I was able to go to the normal version of Win10 and life is good again. Be careful with ""S"" version!!!!The computer seems fine. I have not used it much yet but setting things up was pretty easy and it seems to work just fine. The problem is that it comes with Microsoft Win10 S. If you don't know what ""S"" is (I didn't) it means that Microsoft will not let you down load things that Microsoft does not like or that is in competition with Microsoft. I have tried once to turn off the ""S"" with out any luck and I am waiting on Microsoft to get back to me. Do yourself a favor and find a laptop with out ""S"" on it!!!!! Microsoft SUCKS",0

"2021 Update: Despite the problems, it's still working pretty good. Apparently, most laptops have cheap built-in webcams that don't last. Did not reinstall Windows. Bought a usb webcam at Amazon. No problems since. Moving this up to 4 stars.2020 Update: I've had this laptop for almost a year. Had been working great in every way. Gave it 5 stars. Even though I'm a desktop guy and only use the laptop occasionally, the hardware all of a sudden is not working properly. Webcam can't be detected, backlighting doesn't work... everything is going kaput. Researched this on HP's website and apparently I'm not the only one who gets ""camera can't be detected"" messages. HP's solution: Reinstall Windows. Reducing to 1 star.Original Review: Love this laptop so far. It's really well-constructed. Everything works. Nice big display with adequate resolution (1920x1080). The backlit keyboard is really nice. Can toggle that on and off. Even the keys on the top row with all the controls have tiny red pilot lights to show whether something is toggled on or off.

Presently it hits the sweet spot between price and superb M1 chip performance. The M1 was a revolution, while the M2—at $300 more—is merely an evolution. If you can find it on sale in the $800 range, this is indeed the laptop to choose, folks.",0
"The battery life is great! Maybe the most redeeming quality. I personally like the way the backlit keyboard feels (layout and key travel). Performance is also great with the 8th gen CPU and SSD. Boots up and off in less than 10 seconds. Very portable and sleek looking.CONS:There are TWO very big cons I have!!!The screen has good specs for the price and it shows it. HOWEVER, the screen FLICKERS very often. Ive tried resetting the drivers and even deleted ALL foreign apps the laptop didn't come with. Still happens and it's only gotten more frequent. The TOUCHPAD stutters and STOPS RESPONDING every 15-20 minutes. Using the laptop is very difficult with this flaw.",0
Muy liviana,0
Great product and quick shipping!,0
"This laptop is fantastic. Been needing a new laptop for a while and I did a ton of research into a quality one with a good GPU, CPU, screen, and thermals. This one performs excellently on all of those and is the best gaming laptop you can get for $1,500 or under IMO.Keyboard feels nice, I like that the trackpad has dedicated buttons.The only con would be that the battery life is not ideal, but it's a gaming laptop and does well on everything else so I can't really complain. Lasts about 2.5 hours if not plugged in and not playing games.Play games like LoL, overwatch, CS:GO all on highest settings and it's super smooth. Would definitely recommend at this price.",0
Nice and compact for easy travel. Great for School work!,0
"My son loves this gaming laptop, everything about it.",0
"El screen es, según mi opinión malo, se ve como si fuera un equipo bien barato y no lo es a pesar q la compre en b friday por 750 pero por lo demas no esta tan mal por eso estoy cambiando mi primera calificación",0
"Besides the 80w 3070 switcheroo that msi pulled on us, my particular laptop had a fault in the cooling system. The copper plate that goes over the cpu die only makes 20% contact on the left side. The right side is completely angled up. In order to alleviate this, I placed a 20mm x 20mm x 1mm copper shim between the cpu die and the copper plate of the cooling system.Now it makes full contact, but the cooling is still kinda meh. Even with a -65mv undervolt and a cooling pad, I couldn't sustain the full 4.2ghz clock speed during testing, instead it drops to ~3.4ghz. Still, I got a cinebench r23 score of 10955. Not nearly as good as the 11800h in the mp66 version of this laptop. One dude on reddit received a score of 14603 with a 4.4ghz all core overclock, so that's a testament on how powerful the 11800h is.Some positives: the 80w 3070 (that's the target tgp, 85 is the tgp limit) performs similarly to a desktop 3060 and has a bit of cooling headroom. I personally got an undervolt-overclock of 1530mhz @ .700v. If you're up for it, you could probably flash the vbios with a more powerful 3070 mobile chip. Just make sure to clamp down on the voltage if the tgp of the vbios is 115w+.Also, the chassis has enough room to put thick heatsinks on the nvme drives.Overall, I think I'm gonna try the msi mg66 with the 125w 3070 since videos on line show it has better cooling.",0
"After a month of waiting my laptop finally came! I was so excited! While trying to get everything booted up the screen would continually go to black. Thinking this was a fluke I continued, but I was wrong. After finally getting all of my preferences set the computer would continually go to sleep. It’s easy enough to wake up. You press a button and then enter your pin. But it just keeps going to sleep on me. Sometimes after 10 minutes of use. Sometimes after five seconds of use. It’s basically unusable in the state. I had to call customer service several times to get a hold of someone who could speak clearly enough to help me and even they suggested to just get a refund directly from Amazon.I really hope I’m the only one this has happened to. If you get this product I hope it goes really well for you. The times that it worked it worked great! But the constant shutting off was enough to make me want to pull out my hair. Awful experience.",0
"It’s a great product if you want a Chromebook and don’t mind that every application is web based. My son called it a “giant portable phone, passing itself off as a computer!” It literally operates like our cell phones, do include needing to download the android version of MS applications. You can use Google docs; however, you can’t use any word processing applications unless you’re connected to the internet. It also lacks certain familiar keys on the keyboard, so you will need to Google the keyboard shortcuts. The Chromebook was frustrating to me. Thank goodness Amazon let me return it!",0
"These little Chromebooks are pretty nice for the money, but they have less customization than a Windows computer. However, Linux apps are allowed (IF your Chromebook has the memory for all the downloads). These dont allow everything to be saved and/or loaded from an SD card, so memory can become an annoying issue.All-in-all I love my little Chromebook. I use it all the time for college and to play music. The blutooth works perfectly and connects right to my phone. There are some features that need to be added, and from what I hear they will add more flexability in future updates. The battery life is a nice plus as well",0
"La computadora me ha parecido increíble hasta ahora, me encanta, he trabajado muy bien con ella hasta ahora, solo me ha presentado cierto desface en la pantalla cuando estoy muy atareada en realidad no se cual seria la razón pero del resto se ha comportado muy bien, los programan ruedan muy bien. En líneas generales el comportamiento tiene 18/20",0

"being a fan of asus for many years i bought this with hopes that it would be as great as my other products from them, and it sure is. solidly built, this little zenbook is fantastic. lightweight and super fast it handles all a normal user can dish out with ease.",0
Pretty good product. One time the screen kind of went crazy but that hasn’t happened in a few months. Overall so far so good,0
I don’t love that the power connection is on the side of the device.,0
"This laptop should never come with anything smaller than 12GB RAM. But if you do get this with 8GB ram, buy ram and add it. 8GBs make it impossible to run multiple programs or even one game and chrome without significant frame drop and lag.The ultra-fan setting works pretty well despite how loud it is.The laptop will let you run most online mmorpgs at 30 FPS with medium settings. Will barely run graphics heavy games like Tera, BDO, and most AAA games.It does however, work pretty decently for F2P games like CS:Go, TF2, Valorant, LoL.The camera is absolute garbage whether or not you can get a decent webcam software and comes preinstalled with a crappy program that will almost seem like adware.Battery life is decent and the computer doesn’t get too hot with general usage.",0
I bought the GL65 leopard and I love it. Works awesome and is super fast. screen quality is awesome and games run smoothly. Laptop feels resilient and of high quality. The only thing I would say is a bit of a downside is the battery life. If you are going to play a big title game then you'll get maybe 3 hours tops on a full charge. I myself use always use it with the charger nearby so that's not really a problem for me. The fan can get a little loud when playing big games but I wouldn't say its bad. All in all for the price and the quality you get this is a good buy and I gave no regrets.,0
"Affordable lightweight laptop, with a ten key. Easy to use. Love it",0
"This computer is user-friendly and easy to set up, but the weight is a little too much for my liking. If they could use lighter materials without compromising on durability, that would be perfect.",1
Grandson loves this,0
Attention. This computer does not come with an SD card.. you can’t download things,0
"Very well built and with an elegant design. Good processor, very fast. Quiet fan operation, cool keeping in palm rest area.I was surprised by the fact that it came with an ""HDD Kit"" (connectors), to expand the storage capacity with an internal HDD disk (I asked Asus and they replied that a HDD or SSD of up to 1 TB can be installed, to expand the capacity storage).Asus customer service is very good (it comes with MyAsus software that makes communication very easy); is one reason I bought this brand. Two years ago I bought an Asus 13 ""Notebook, I had a software problem with the keyboard lighting and in a few messages they guided me on how to solve it, until now I have never had problems again.I sincerely recommend this Notebook.",0
"This laptop may not have all the bells and whistles that other more expensive computers do, but it gets the job done at a more reasonable price. It is very quiet while operating and is super lightweight and portable. Meets all the basic needs of a student.",0
"Came when it said it would, everything was exactly as specified.",0
"This is a great computer great for multi-tasking. I am very pleased, thank you!",0
"I hate this laptop with every fiber of my being. The screen quality is weird and lacks clarity. I'm assuming the lack of brightness is supposed to be easier on your eyes, when in reality my eyes are straining. The mousepad is incredibly unresponsive and finicky, one moment doing nothing, the next moment I've somehow zoomed in. There's an ill-placed search key where caps lock should be, so that's fun to bump and suddenly derail my entire essay. You can't resize icons. I can't for the life of me save anything to my desktop, only pin it to the shelf. I'm not sure if I can return this waste of money, but lord I'm going to try.",0
Will not accept Windows or any other software.,0
The problems of this laptop are as follows: not able to wake up from sleeping mode; restart suddenly without reason...so I had to return it.,0

"After a few days of use, Overall performance of the laptop is great if you are looking for something good enough to at med/high settings 144The material is likely made out of plastic( If I'm wrong, at least it feels like plastic).Still need to test more games. But there is one thing that is pretty terrible and expected, battery life seems to drain more then usual.It's no surprise that gaming laptops drain battery quickly compared to normal laptops, But it seems like this laptop drains alot faster than usual. Currently I am using the stock factory settings and haven't changed anything within the settings, so that could my issue. but for the average person that doesn't know much about tweaking settings, this is expected.Also note some of the hardware is a bit outdated but not by much.I'll still need to test this laptop out in the next couple months to see how it holds up.So I'll be back to update this review.If you can catch this on a deal like I did on prime day( less then 1000 buckaroos), Then it may be worth it.",0

"I was duped and I don't want the rest of you to be. I have no idea how this is STILL rated one of the top laptops. There's a glitch every single time I try and use it. I spend more time troubleshooting this laptop's glitches than I do getting my actual work done. It's a $2,000-$3,000 piece of trash. Of course, I thought things would get better and that the problems were because I wasn't used to the laptop yet. Nope! 3-ish years later and it still encounters the same problems over and over as well as brand new ones. Every. Freaking. Day. Do not buy.",0
Like it - disadvantage - buy and spend time for installation of the windows 10 pro.,0

"Bought in May 2018. After about 20 minutes of use, the trackpad gets erratic and stuck; requires constant rebooting.Dell replaced the very noisey fan and also replaced the SSD.Dell serviced it but the trackpad problem continues to plague the unit.Am tired of spending hours with Dell Tech Support!",0
This chrombook words very nice .,0
It is sooooo in another level from other devices. Wouldn't change it for nothing else,0
Most games look like irl and have a very great frame rate speed. Not all game need turbo or extreme mode to run flawlessly which is nice.,0
"This laptop is everything I was hoping it to be. Not many complaints besides the batter life being kinda short but it doesn't matter since I always use it when plugged in anyway, I also don't have a real use for the rgb keyboard but it's pretty to have. Overall a great gaming laptop for the price.",0
"I liked the small form factor and sleek outward appearance of this laptop but have been disappointed with the performance, battery life, and how noisy it is. I can live with the battery life and performance issues, but the noise is really intolerable. I was replacing my old ASUS 17 inch laptop and wanted to order reasonably high end specs, but even though the specs are higher end than my old system, it barely seems faster, and at times there are inordinate delays in responsiveness. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised at the short battery life of the system because there isn't much room to fit a battery in such a small package, and that actually isn't that big a problem since I mostly use the system at home and can reconnect to power whenever I need to, but its still disappointing. I seem to get 3-4 hours from a full charge. The really annoying issue is that the cooling fan seems to run noisily when I am barely doing anything with the system, and once it starts running it doesn't want to stop unless I turn the system off. I regret purchasing this system and I haven't even finished paying for it yet.",0
"It is very stressful for me to get new tech, being a more ""experienced"" person. My last phone had me wanting to throw it into large vats of water or stomp it with both feet and I did return it 3 times before finally managing to semi-adjust to it and I now have a so-so relationship with that piece of frustrating technology. So, when my Mac Air started to circle the drain I dreaded getting a new lap top. When my son recommended Chromebook I was skeptical that it could be as simple as it sounded to set up and use. But I was totally amazed!!! I had the lap top open and I was logged in with gmail in 5 minutes.Anything that I have needed to do has been easy to google. The screen quality and sound are both better than I had with the Mac but it was pretty old. The simple set up, speed and use of docs and downloads has been easy and I didn't have to buy software extra like I did with Mac. I also found connecting to my HP printer was much easier than the process to connect on my Mac.For me to transition from a Mac to the Chromebook was very smooth. This screen is so much larger than my Mac and has taken some getting used to. At this price my husband has encouraged me to get a smaller one to carry when we go somewhere but I am adjusting to this larger size. I thought the large size would be a viewing plus and it is. It's heavier than the small Mac and that is the adjustment. I use it for basics and work- banking, contracts, etc and I am very pleased!!! I will add that I never liked iPhones but did like my Mac Air but like the Chromebook much better so far.",0
bluetooth and wifi just don't work and the screen freezes until it gets back to a working temp.,0

"This is a great little computer. I use it daily for working in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Premier. It will also run Left For Dead 2 really well but not GTA V or Far Cry 5.

"I first want to start by saying that this was my first laptop purchase for personal/work use in about 5 years, so a lot in terms of CPU performance has changed since Intel 4th gens. Anyway, on to the review. This is a great laptop, the one I purchased had the 256GB SSD with Win 10 installed on it. Super fast boot speeds even from a cold boot. Upon using it I had read in the reviews here on Amazon that some drivers may need updating to get them to work properly. Sure enough my backlit keyboard was having trouble getting going and the touchpad, wireless NIC, and audio needed driver updates as well. No big deal, just head to the Asus support site and look up this model of Vivobook. After using it for about 2 weeks now, I have only one gripe about this specific model (I don't know if the others have this issue too) it's with the Caps lock key. There's no LED light or on screen notification when you hit it. I was stunned there wasn't something built into Asus's framework that would make up for this, but I guess not. A way that made it not as bad was going to accessibility under keyboard settings and enabling sounds when special keys are hit like Num lock and caps lock. Now it's not that big of a deal in the grand image of the laptop but still an annoying object to deal with. It shouldn't detract you from purchasing this too that's why I'm leaving it at 5 starts.Pros:. Nice backlit keyboard. Backlit LED screen 1920x1080 clear quality. Keyboard is fine to me (others said there's give but I am coming from a Lenovo flex 2 that had way worse bend and got used to it). Battery life holds up maybe not 8 hours but about 5-6 with decent use (I'm never far from an outlet anyway). Fingerprint sensor is awesome! One of the best features in my opinion. Little bloatware, get rid of McCaffe ASAP (Avira, Avast, ESET, Bitdefender) I'd even say Norton just put something else on for security. Room for expansion, has a M.2 SSD slot taken up and room for another 2.5' storage piece (just got a 1TB SSD for data recently to take advantage of this). 8GB of RAM is more than enough for what I want in this laptop but you can expand up to 16GB if you want to I supposeCons:Disassembly is tedious, looks up a guide before you start prying at the back panelOther than that good luck, it's an awesome work laptop and should be reviewed as such.",0
El único detalle que le veo es que viene en inglés y por consecuencia no tiene ?,0
Nice product,0
When the product arrived there was a slight dent in the side. Originally didn't think it'd affect the product but the laptop would make loud clicking noises whenever music was played. Graphics were also very poor. Would not recommend product till these problems are fixed.,0
Cheap and good.,0

The keyboard and display are great.,0
The battery life is more than satisfactory and lasts for several hours doing productivity tasks/Web browsing without video.,0
"You can't beat the styling, battery life and performance for the price.I got this while I was learning how to program for school.I've been doing some photoshop(GIMP) with it as well as Blender and haven't had a problem. I play HoTS and Hearthstone on it all the time, and some Minecraft(playing Project ozone Lite right now with my wife).Has trouble running WoW but plays most games I throw at it just fine, Don't Starve and Factorio etc.Only down side is that I wished it had more ram.I'm learning Unity3D right now and the 8gb is kind of the bottleneck.",0
"Fast processor, lightweight, and small size.",0
"had this laptop for around 3 weeks now and it is running very well. almost every game I have runs extremely fast. definitely recommended.pros:- i7-10th gen processor and a full RTX 2070 GPU- 144hz display- great keyboard- very sturdy- comes with a program that monitors the laptop and allows you to overclock- can change to a battery ""eco"" mode in the built-in program that prolongs the battery life greatly (game performance is really bad while in this mode though, so its only good for light work)cons:- battery drains really quickly while gaming- fans can be loud but this is the case for all laptops around this price range- mediocre speakers",0
My freaking laptop came to me broken the screen was all messed up there was no protection no foam support or anything just 2 cardboard holder peices,0
My MacBook M2 chip Midnight was the best laptop I could ever have. This was my first MacBook don’t expect the MacBook to have a touch screen or bar because it doesn’t if you do videos or editing this is a great laptop Thank you.,0
it was a gift and my grandaugh loves it.,0
The product description is very unclear. In one place it says 0 disk storage and another refers to 7200 RPM Drive (Hard Disk??). What is offered in terms of storage? Reluctant to buy without clear information.,0
"This laptop is really fast and the battery lasts really long.The battery lasts me about a week with just one charge and I find that crazy.There is not fan noise and this doesn't get hot.The quality is really good.. I mean the way the laptop opens with one hand and the smooth closing of the lid is really smooth.The screen isn't the best but its still really good.This laptop has the M1 chip, fastest chip on the market.This laptop's bench marks are off the roof.It's great for casual use like, watching movies, using word docs and excel sheet, coding and video editing.I wouldn't recommend gaming even though basic games will do just fine.",0
I've only been using the Chromebook for a few days. This is a great unit for all your basic needs. It is convenient and lightweight. A full charge battery life is approximately 14 hours.,0
Perfect for my daughter in high school / college classes. Didn't break the bank and does its job.,0
Before purchase anything watch my video. I bought a laptop. But laptop’s keyboard doesn’t work. I spent a lot time for this freak machine.,0
Muy buen equipo,0
"This laptop is my first, and great for what little I do on it: social media, email, games...things like that. I'm over 70 and got it up and running myself, although my 20 year old grandson did all the technical things for me. He loves it, so it must be good. It doesn't have a touch screen so I ordered an Acer wireless mouse. I'm happy with both the mouse and laptop so far. I can't comment on the battery life since I use it only a couple of hours a day.",0
"It's cheap and fast enough for basic internet crap. It is really, really, really horrible if you learned how to type years ago on a normal keyboard. Every time you try to type the letter A, you get a google search box because everything on the keyboard is off center. There are no home, end, delete or cap lock keys. Every time I use this machine, I want to throw it out the window or hang myself. Spend the money and buy a Windows machine....",0

"I bought this laptop and didn't feel like I should review it until buying a similar product, because the HDMI port was malformed and I could not attach my Mixed Reality headset.I have succeeded in attaching my headset to a different laptop, so I know it wasn't user error. The laptop itself is fast, hot, and blew me away at how fast it installed Unity3D and related dev tools. Should it have had a working port, I would've kept",0
"I only kept it a short time, but only because it's size. It was too big for my taste, but a good size for husband.",0
"Absolutely impressed so far.I got this laptop 10 days ago. Been testing and running every app I require for gaming and doing my work. And it has been flawless. **RTX 2070 graphics at this price is a great deal**Pros:? Screen: For those of you who haven’t used a 144hz screen, you will not be disappointed.? Graphics: RTX 2070 and i7 … WOW? Design & build quality: o RGB Keyboard, the lighting has different modes. The keys are really smooth and I like the font of the letters on the keyboard. It has a number pad too (really wanted that). o The screen is bright enough. o The aluminum finish looks and feels nice. It’s strong and well made. o The track pad works well. o NO HEATING UP ISSUES (MAJOR PRO).Incase it heats up, the ‘cooler boost’ does its job well.? Weight: Not heavy compared to other gaming laptop. Makes it much easier to take it around.? Gaming: I mostly use this laptop to play Steam games like Counter Strike, Rust etc and it is super smooth.? Work: I also get my graphic design and video editing works done and the super-fast response whilerendering my work is amazingly helpful.. saves a lot of time to be honest.Cons ( but not so bad ):? Battery: Battery life is not great. It last only for 2 – 3 hours, but I always use it while its plugged in.? Charger Port: The charger port is placed in a weird spot. Like its right in the middle , gets in the way of the mouse sometimes.? Speakers: The integrated speaker sound is barely audible, but since I use a headset it’s not much of an issue.? Fans: The fans get loud while playing games, ( headset solves the issue for me , AGAIN ).? Aluminium finish: The aluminum finish gets fingerprints easily, so got to keep cleaning with a fiber cloth.Overall:Pretty Impressed and quite happy with my purchase so far. Since I tend to use my laptops for both work and personal use, I use the laptop for almost the entire day and so far I’m loving everything about the MSI GL65 Leopard.At this price I don't think you can get a better machine than this gem. This is by far the best choice for a mid-range gaming laptop.Thank you MSI/Amazon for this amazing deal!",0

"Sturdy construction vs. my 3 year old Asus which didn't hold up well. Unfortunately,the battery/time left reporting system was inadequate even after I sent it out for service and they replaced the motherboard . If their C'book reports 100% charge , there should be 7-9 hours left, not 4-5 which I consistently got.I don't expect it to be exact, just not misleading. I have 2 Samsung cell phones and 1 flat panel Tv all of which are great..as an engineer by training, charging and reporting time left should be a minor issue..very disappointing for a Samsung product.The prior Asus Chromebook didn't have this problem.3/22 update The time left reporting battery reporting feature seems to have improved somewhat i.e. after the machine ""warms"" up the time left will improve at lets say 97% charge from 5 plus hours to over 7 hours(but just over). I haven't seen 8 hours left at 100 % charge under any conditions. Again, I don't expect the measurement to be exact, but they must be sensing battery temperature as it warms up and using software to predict time left on charge...maybe the battery has to ""cure""? Response time is still a bit slower than the old Asus it replaced, but again the Samsung seems to be of sturdier construction.",0

"I got this chrome book and kind of liked it. The monitor is fairly big and very sharp. Though chrome is limited at a few things, I love how quick it is. I open it up, it's ready in a couple of seconds. The problem o kept having is that it kept dropping my wifi signal. When it happened, there was nothing to do other than restart it. It wasn't all that bad, because restarts are fast. After a while though, it just happened too often. I read it is a common problem with hp chrome books so I was left with no option but to send it back to Amazon. I'm ordering an acer one and keeping my fingers crossed.A couple of other things I didn't care for about this Chromebook were that the screen was actually a bit small for me. Also, the speakers are facing from the bottom, which works well on a hard surface, but if you lay this thing down on the couch or rug, or even on your lap, it's pretty hard to hear it.",0
"I bought this laptop over others because:* The RAM is clocked faster than other laptops in its category* The solid state hard drive is connected over the PCI bus, which gives it much faster I/O* The laptop has 2x2 advanced ac band wifi* The price is very reasonable (I spent about $1200 in 2019)I was pleasantly surprised that* The processor thermal condition is excellent, almost no thermal throttling* The screen is gorgeous* The touch screen and digitizer are accurate and pleasant to use* The fingerprint sensor is lightning fastThis laptop is special because the data pipelines inside it are all fast, there are no bottlenecks.* Storage (SSD) is M.2 PCIe* RAM is high clock speed* Processor is fast with plenty of cache* Network interface is high bandwidth with two wifi chips working tandemBasically, this is a fast puppy. The MX-150 NVIDIA graphics card is a nice bonus, but it will only let you play low-end and legacy games.",0
Best laptop ive ever owned. Perfect for any type of gaming. I havent found one that it cant run.,0
The laptop kept crashing and giving blue screens of death from day one right out of the box. Couldnt fix despite doing all necessary updates and troubleshooting. Ended up returning to get a refund because i didnt want to even bother trying to get a new one after that.Edit: almost a month later and i still have not recieved my refund. Could not be more angry or disappointed in this experience,0
It was great for six months and then one morning it turned off and never turned on again. Maybe it overheated? I was using it on a table with a tablecloth...,0
"I was looking for an alternative to my Full-ATX Desktop computer that I could take with me while traveling (I will have a bit of free time during my travels) and so I found this laptop as well as the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro. Ultimately I ended up going with this laptop as it was nearly the same internals with the added benefit of being available on Amazon (12 months 0% financing).So far this laptop has been nothing but extraordinary. I am able to play New World on max graphics and my laptop actually performs better than my desktop, and my laptop is running on WiFi. Amazingly enough, I can run league of legends at 400 fps, which is obviously overkill, but is worth noting.If you are looking for a quiet computer, this is not the right choice, but you already knew that. The fans definitely seem like they are going to lift the computer off your desktop, but I usually play with headphones/a headset on, which blocks out 99.9% of any ambient noise, making the fan noise a non-issue. On the topic of fans, I appreciate having a toggle for the fan speed - you can press Fn + Up and the fans will instantly turn on full blast to cool down your computer significantly. This is quite nice after a long gaming session where you want to throw the laptop in your backpack and not melt it to pieces with the blazing internals.Overall, love this laptop. Would recommend.",0
"Works fine, but super slow",0
Cumple con lo que se requiere; buena apuesta por el precio.,0
"This laptop offers too good of a performance for its price. If you are deciding whether to get it or not, stop. Just get it.",0
"I bought this for work to replace my Samsung Book 9. It cost a bit more to get the 8th gen with 16bg RAM, but I am *very* pleased with it's performance! It is easily three times as fast as my 2014 era laptop. More importantly it doesn't get hot. I also tested this laptop with the Sonnet Breakaway Puck eGPU via Thunderbolt 3, and they work beautifully together on my external monitor. The fingerprint reader works well, but if you have it in clamshell powering an external monitor, it's annoying to have to open it in order to scan your fingerprint when you log back in. I think that can be disabled though. With the upgrade to USB 3 and Thunderbolt, this laptop doesn't have an old style USB A port. But it came with an adapter. Overall I love this thing!",0
"i should have bought a 15"" a bit heavy for traveling..having guy come out for expert setup.so i will have further review later..so far great speed .. not a big gamer though..so dont know how it would be if i was a heavy user..do ur research on that subject..",0
"The screen bezel is super-thin, yet they managed to fit a camera on the tip edge.",0
like chrome book,0
"The cooling system on this computer is top-notch, it runs as cool as a cucumber even under heavy load. But the glossy screen is a nightmare in bright light, it's like looking into a mirror. I long for a matte screen option that eliminates glare and allows me to work anywhere I want.",1
Me encanta el producto muy practico muy versatil ademas muy facil de usar simplemente puedo decir que esta exelente el producto,0
Set up was very easy and straight forward That also had tips to help you out if you weren't use to Windows 10,0
"It is a beautiful machine the runs a lot for a long time.e without getting too hot (as many other machines do). Great touchscreen in a lightweight, very slim form factor to support tablet like use. The downside is that their chat based support is slow and can't look outside the box when troubleshooting (in my case a bad speaker driver). I'd love to see a machine of this caliber running the MAC O/S. It should come with a pen.",0
Touchpad doesn't turn off with bluetooth mouse,0
Perfecto para home office.,0
budget option for gaming,0
Silent mode is unusable. Its too slow for me,0
"I bought this laptop at COSTCO on a black Friday special. It is everything I wanted except for the S mode. If you use Chrome or LibreOffice you will have to leave the S mode. It took me about 45 minutes with technical help from Costco, Hp, and Microsoft itself to get rid of S mode. Would give the unit 5 stars if it wasn't for the time I had to spend getting rid of S mode. The battery is ""built-in"", so that could be a problem in the future.",0
The touchpad/screenpad never worked right out of the box. Spent over an hour on the phone with ASUS tech support plus a couple more trying various things I found on the internet but wasn't able to get it to work. Very disappointing. At least the Amazon return process was easy.,0
After 6 months of light use the screen goes completely black and wont turn on,0
Fast and looks good. Worked like a charm out of the box and has been used 4+ hrs daily for past 4 months. It's a great laptop for the money. The SSD that allows the quick boot of windows is awesome.,0
In the description it said 365° rotating screen & it doesn't,0
The keyboard broke with in a month and now the sound went out! I’ve it two months!,0
"I have been a die-hard Dell user since 2004. The last 2 Dell laptops didn't last 3 years before slowing down and making funny noises. So I did a lot of research and decided on this Acer. I'm so glad I did!I might change my mind on value for money after I've used it for a while, but the material quality is top-notch except for the keyboard. The arrows and weird, up/down small and left/right are larger. I don't get that. The Delete key is very small, too. Everything else is about the same. Picture quality is the best I've seen--ever.This is a 2017 product that has i7 core. Dual core product.The WiFI connection isn't lightning fast as advertised. I have 5G internet and a 1500mbs modem, and brand new router that is 750mbs, but the most I can get is 422mbs--my old computer was about 350-380mbs. So it is an improvement, but not much. Keys are not backlit, but I can live with that.However, I can't believe the picture clarity. It is awesome!!! I do book covers, editing, and digital painting/illustrations and the quality of the screen resolution cannot be beaten. I also have macular degeneration and this is the easiest on my eyes that I've ever had before. This right here is worth the money I paid.",0
this is so versatile that I found myself using the touch screen and voice instructions frequently,0
It's a super computer in laptop form. What more could I want!? Fantastic form and function. Buy one.,0
"Lo compré para usar en la oficina. Aquipo rápido, lo he usado por más de un año y no he tenido problema alguno. Muy contento con la compra. La pantalla muy nítida. Quizás un punto a considerar es que la autonomía de la beatería no es muy larga.",0
"We bought this Lenovo Chromebook for our daughter (mandatory at her middle school), and the battery failed to hold a charge and the Chromebook won't operate unless plugged in. We sent it back to Lenovo for repair and it came back with the repair ticket stating the battery has been replaced. In the meantime, while it was getting ""repaired"", the warranty ran out. I contacted Lenovo to let them know the Chromebook battery is still not working properly and they informed me the warranty has run out, so I must contact a local service center and pay for repairs. I contested the warranty claim, since it still had the same problem as before, so therefore it was not fixed and it should still be ""under warranty"" with the original repair claim date. I was given another phone number to call, which subsequently does not work. I'd stay away from this particular product and Lenovo.",0
"Upon receiving the laptop I booted it up and within 2 minutes it froze. Thinking it was a fluke I rebooted the machine and it froze up again. I've managed to reinstall windows, update drivers and nothing. This thing freezes within 2 to 5 minutes of startup if you're lucky. sometimes i can't even get past the login screen. HP has offered little to no help for a machine that is essentially bricked out of the box.",0
"a good graphics card, tons of RAM, decent SSD and it's lightweight.",0
"It is light weight, has a touch screen, pencil and everything you could possibly want.",0
It really has fine metal finished chassis and I love the way it looks.,0
"De batalla,hubiera estado perfecto tuviera la letra ñ,pero de ahí en fuera cumple con las expectativas.No decepciona la marca.",0
I purchased this for coding so its perfect for what i need.,0
"I have been building my own PC's for gaming since the late 80's. Granted in the last 10-12 years my system builds have become a bit more budget minded due to having a family and other responsibilities. This laptop has everything I would want in a new desktop build and probably more than my normal budget would allow. The screen is amazing, the RGB keyboard is hypnotizing (according to my wife and kids) the power of the CPU&GPU is extremely good. Everything I have thrown at it has run great 100+ FPS. I also really like the MSI tool for adjusting gaming mode, I was able to run it on silent playing Assassins Creed Odyssey with barely a hitch in the graphics and not a peep from the fans so my family could watch TV and not hear fans all night. Even in normal mode with the fans allowed to adjust automatically my son's comment regarding the fans was ""This laptop sounds like it's talking where your old laptop was screaming"" lol My only critique is the screen has a bit of light bleed at the edges when it's at max brightness but this might just be mine. I haven't contacted MSI support yet to find out if this is normal. Overall I am very satisfied with my choice, I looked at several other gaming laptops in this price range and kept hearing how good the MSI was and knowing MSI has had a very good reputation for a very long time it was't hard to make the leap.",0
"This was the second time I purchased this chrome book. Last was was several yrs old. I like it so I bought the same one and recieved it the end of February. Recently, the beginning of May I used it in the morning and it was fine. Later I turned it on and had some difficulty with the screen being distorted. There was no physical damage to my laptop and know reason why it should have an issue. I Contacted support who recommended sending my Samsung Chrome book to them for diagnostic repair. They recieved it and can fix it for a charge and claiming it is not covered under warranty. I had it less than three months and due to no fault of my own it does not work . I have always purchased Samsung products but will no longer. A very disappointed and dissatisfied customer.",0
I am returning this laptop. It is advertised to have Bluetooth and doesn’t. I have to have Bluetooth. This is now going to be such a hassle to return and have to order another laptop......after checking to make sure that the seller’s description is accurate!,0
The shipping was fast arrive a day faster,0
I am no expert but I am very happy with this computer. The only complaint I have is that the sound is inadequate. It is very difficult to hear unless I use Bluetooth or headphones.,0
"En mi factura esta especificado que la laptop poseía teclado retroiluminado, pero a la hora en que llego no poseía dicha característicaEl equipo es excelente por lo que cuesta, ligero, bonito, buena pantalla y práctico para transportar. Perfecto para trabajo de ofimática o laptop para universidad (que no requiera trabajos pesados).Lo que si recomendaría es ampliar e almacenamiento y pensar en un futuro ampliar la memoria RAM ya que posee una bandeja disponible",0
"Las especificaciones son muy buenas, lamentablemente venia muy mal configurada y he batallado demasiado con ello. Ya can 3 reinicios de fabrica y Asus no cubre esos problemas porque son de software, he tenido que buscar ayuda con un técnico para poder reparar todos los problemas que trae, lo único que falta es que pueda detectar la cámara ya que a veces funciona y la mayoría de las veces no funciona. Fuera de eso es excelente su rendimiento y al correr los juegos (después de arreglar muchos problemas).Soporte técnico de Asus hace responsable a Windows.",0
"Battery life is false first week it was dying with an hour of use. screen sucks, so dark and unclear. Stopped working right after the warranty won’t turn on or charge, and they refuse to give me a refund or any help. Save your money, go with another company!",0
I love this product. It is really good for surfing the web and doing internet duties. I am nursing student so I just need a small online notebook that can help me with my online practice questions and Samsung Chromebook does the job. I am very happy with my purchase. I just wish the speakers were a little louder. But overall very happy!!,0
"El problema es la baja calidad de la cámara, esperaba algo mejor.",0
Bought for my wife for Christmas. She seems to really like it.,0
3rd time buying this laptop and its awful keeps freezing up and it's not as fast its suppose to be not buying anymore electronics on amazon anyone was hoping it would be good ha ha its not !!!!,0
this system is the noise when in full-on gaming mode,0
Good,0
"Very disappointed as i just got my device and i got an message as you see in picture. If seller gets back to me and fixes my problem i can change the review, all depends. Will update.",0
"I am not a very demanding computer user - just some web surfing and shopping, so I figured this computer would suffice, and I have been very happy with ASUS products in the past. But this computer is constantly bogging down, due to the CPU and the RAM being maxed out, according to the task manager. It has great battery life, and is very lightweight, but I wish I could at least put more RAM in it. Alas, it is not possible to upgrade the RAM due to the fact that it is soldered to the motherboard, according to other reviewers. I wish now, that I had bought a model with a better CPU and more RAM.",0
"No me gustó, que la batería da únicamente 3 horas, yo uso Photoshop, illustrator y ya con eso se agotaron los 8GB de ram, pero del resto es un buen equipo",0
great product!!!,0
"Honestly, this laptop is great. I got this for a really great price, and it was between this and the dell xps, so i bought this (kinda regretting that buts its a-okay). The first few months of using this were fantastic. Battery was relativel good, the display is crisp, and the build quality is superb. This all has one problem though- the fan. The fan is so loud, it's insane. It just randomly turns on when I do super light tasks, like watching netflix or just deleting files. It got to a point where I have to use headphones to drown out the sound. Not only is the fan loud, but it's also so inconsistent. I can be playing games like minecraft or destiny and it wont run the fan, but then when I do light tasks it roars like a jet. it's just too much.",0
"Good prices Good quality,I am using ASUS TUF Dash F15 (2022) 16GB 500SSDand I upgrade it to 32GB ram (16GB x2) and 1TB SSD (500GB x2)It has 2 slots for SSD and 2 slots for ram which is very good for upgrading. And easy for installation.But when you are playing games (even in turbo mode), the temperature will become very very high.",0
"So, I bought this laptop a month ago. Overall, I liked the laptop. The screen was just good enough, the keyboard felt good, the biometrics worked well and the trackpad also worked well except with some minor scrolling issues here and there. But, the problem however is that the laptop turns off automatically from time to time. It is so annoying. However, it turned on everytime it automatically turned off.But, just yesterday(10/19/2018), it turned off and hasn't turned on yet and I had so many of my files saved on that laptop. The customer service told me to try different things, none of which worked. The best thing to do was remove the battery and plug it in again and I did not want to risk doing that. So, I just returned the laptop with full refund since it had not been a month. I liked the laptop so I might buy it again, but it is at a higher price now, and I have to go through the hassle of waiting for the new laptop again for a couple of days and setting it up again and praying it does not die on me again. So, it is a good laptop but certainly not a trustworthy laptop.",0
"As per the ad, it states it comes with Windows 10. I ordered two of these and they both came with Windows 11. My apps do not work on 11. I am an American living in Mexico and had to pay shipping and import fees so that returning was not an option. I had to pay a technician here to do a complete install of Windows 10 because the roll back option had expired. I would avoid this seller.",0
"this laptop is awesome, the weight and power and look is outstanding!",0
"found it complicated and deprecated quickly. The purchase price for me was 1000 saw it at 90 less 2 months later now it's almost $200 less. Don't feel too good about this,",0
"I've had this laptop for over a month now and I am very impressed with it's design and performance. First of all I think it looks very nice; it's thin, sleek and has thin bezels on the screen. The i5 processor paired with the SSD and 8 gbs of RAM gives a very smooth experience, and it can even handle some light games! I've tested Dead Cells, Bastion, Minecraft, and Torchlight 2, and they can all run at 60 fps with some tweaking. The fingerprint scanner is much better than what old laptops used to have. It makes logging in very convenient and fast, you can even add multiple fingers! One issue is that the face unlock feature (Window's Hello), doesn't seem to work for me, but it's not really a big deal IMO.If you're looking for a lightweight laptop for school, travel, or work I highly recommend this Asus!",0
"I have to say that i was pleased with what i got. I never bought a renewed product before. With the kids home from school because of the corvid-19 quarantine we needed another laptop for schooling. There isnt a scratch, nick, or blemish on it. The cord looks brand new. It works like new. It comes with a 1 year warranty which is great but i also got the extended warranty. Its pretty fast but a small screen at 14 in. Size doesnt seem to make a difference for me considering its for my 8 year old son. It may make a difference to others. I know its a hit or miss on the quality of the product you get when its renewed. I got lucky and I'm very happy with it.",0
"It is worth the money for it. It has eveyrthing I was looking for: speed, storage, screen, etc. Good machine",0
Never stayed connected to the wireless. I would need to constantly reboot this to get it connected and no other device in our house had that issues.,0
"Neat and shiny, great gift.",0
Love it. Everything I wished for in a laptop!!,0
Slowest computer ever!! It takes 15 minutes just to get on a site and I can’t accomplish anything on it. I guess you get what you pay for but it’s all I could afford at the time.,0
Love this laptop it's super fast and loads faster then any previous computers I've ever had. It's a great buy.,0
CPU and GPU keeps running hot. Gotten Blue Screen of Death after 2nd day playing on line. Would not recommend for a real gamer. I am not and just started playing with my husband. Have cooling pad and all. Just mailed it back to Amazon today!,0
The carter didn’t work at all thanks,0
it was the larger than typical touch pad.,0
Seemed like a nice unit but the microphone quit working within the first hour of use. This rendered the Google assistant much less usefull. Item was returned.,0
"After reading multiple reviews on several laptops, and trying my luck on this 5800H 3050 Ti, I'm so happy I made the choice!Plays for fornite at 260-300fps, the display is absolutely crisp as anything I've ever seen.Nothing to complain about with this rig.",0
"Just to be certain, this is the Ryzen 7 4800H processor 16GB ram ddr4 and 512 SSD - I put a 1TB ssd in it m.2 - the 144fps IPS screen is soo nice! 1660 TI handles anything ive thrown at it!! its beautiful!! buy it",0
Fans sound like a jet engine about to take off when the cooler boost is activated,0
"Sleek design, awesome keyboard setup, exceptional graphics quality and sound. This is a great gaming computer as well as everyday work as a graphics designer. I am very impressed with the overall qualities and features this computer gives me. I highly recommend and would buy again.",0
"Aunque en los primeros días me tiro un reinicio raro, luego no tuve ningun problema a la hora de usarla, corre bien en juegos como Valorant, Spiderman, así tambien en programas de Arquitectura como D5 Render, Lumion, Autocad, sin ningún problema si tuviera que ponerle un pero es el almacenamiento pero eso se soluciona usando el slot de ampliación, tambien destacar que ninguna ram esta soldada, es decir ambos son reemplazables sin tener que prescindir del dual channel de ram",0
"Great product. The battery could last a bit longer and it is not as light as computers made today BUT, this thing is really fast and is able to run many programs at once. If I could give it 10 stars for Value for Money I would",0
"I purchased this for $1,399 from and it was a direct Amazon.com purchase. This was a graduation gift for my son, and for the price, and features included this was the best deal I could find anywhere! I had purchased my son an MSI laptop roughly 2 years ago which was my first MSI purchase and he has been happy with it's performance, so at this price and knowing that it would perform well for him in college (with a little gaming on the side LOL) this laptop was a steal! The 144Hz display is noticeably improved from the previous laptop's screen, and the RTX 2070 has already allowed some seriously cool gaming on the highest settings! Anyone for some Raytraced Minecraft?!?! Apparently it gets a little hot when games are using the hardware to it's fullest... but that seems to be expected on all these current gaming laptops. The bottom has plenty of open mesh area to allow dissipation but probably makes for a hot lap... recommend a lap desk of some kind, maybe with it's own cooling fans. The keyboard is more seriously cool tech, Steel Series provides full RGB lighting per key with amazing preset effects. Looks amazing!!! If you can find this laptop for such a low price I would highly recommend it!!! P.S. I now see this is already sold out from Amazon and priced much higher from other sellers.",0
"Bought this for my mom, she’s just barely learning how to use it. I love the fact that it’s easy for her to use and she doesn’t feel lost.",0
Definitely a good buy! I work from home and it’s all I needed!,0
"I have had my new MacAir not quite two weeks and it is even better than I expected. This one is with the new M1 chip and is an upgrade from my previous Mac....which I loved. Faster, better, more battery. What's not to like. And frankly the price for the machine is a bargain. I do not use my Mac for gaming, heavy downloads, large graphics so can't comment but is why the Air is a perfect choice over the Pro. Transferring files etc from my previous Mac was a snap and now I have my ""old"" Mac on the M1 so everything works better. I was a bit surprised everything is the same size and weight....but that's likely because I didn't look at those specs before purchase. One sweet thing about the Mac is it comes about 70% charged so just open and start. If you are considering a Mac or have one and are thinking about upgrade just do it. And Amazon made it easy....arrived in two days.",0
The price for performance here is great.,0
"I bought this laptop and have been using it for about 9 months. Immediately after I bought it, it would start blue screening while in use (almost always due to kbclass.sys despite the fact that the keyboard is built-in) and then would not start up for 2-3 days. The manufacturer has blocked resets and I can't reset the PC from the cloud, from a USB device, or from the local file system.Don't buy this laptop.It breaks and is unfixable.",0
I had this machine less than a week when the boot sequence wouldnt launch. Got errors all the time. Mostly due to corruption of files because the machine over heated. In addition to the errors after having it for less than a few days I get an error saying my memory was full?I returned the item the next day.,0
Wouldn't stay connected to the internet. Confusing to figure out. I'm going to stick with my tablets.,0
"Wifi keeps disconnecting otherwise, a good value",0
"Excellent! Slim, fast and light!",0
They did a great job building this mini machine,0
"I was very impressed with the MSI Leopard laptop. The 144hz screen is the best 15"" display I've ever seen on a laptop and it was able to handle all the games I threw at it with ease (Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Heroes of the Storm, World of Warcraft). It's also very light and comfortable to carry around.For the price, you're not going to get a better gaming laptop that's this portable.",0
Purchased for our son for online school. Great for after school is done he has his own gaming laptop. No issues at all so far with this model.,0
"Great little computer for a casual user. Highly recommend if you're simply using for web surfing, email, music, etc. Also has the added bonus of now running apps from the Google play store.",0
Muy buena inversión a un precio bajo en comparación a otros equipos con menos capacidad. En cuanto a juego corre de maravilla con los gráficos al tope. Para due?o gráfico es una bala. La recomiendo 100%.,0
best seller and good product,0
"The impressive computational power and speed of this computer are undeniable. It handles heavy-duty software without breaking a sweat. However, the battery life leaves a lot to be desired, barely lasting through half a day of work. How revolutionary would it be to have a self-charging feature that harnesses thermal energy from the device's heat output, converting it into power?",1
Absolutely LOVE this laptop.,0
"The power it packs on the size, temperatures and weight it has is astonishing.",0
"I would take a bullet for my Lenovo X1 Carbon. I love this thing. If it was a dude, id be gay with it.",0
this computer has a great battery life and it is just like every other computer just smaller size and it is a great brand name. i will do an update in couple of months i have had this for only 3 days,0
ok,0
i got this for my mom she likes it and says its very nice,0
"While CPU appeared fast, graphics and overall performance did not equal the sum of the parts as I expected.",0
I’ve been wanting a MacBook for the longest and when I came across this I was very suspicious about it but read the reviews and gave it a shot!! And so happy I did even tho my first one was stolen from Amazon but I called right away once I was alert my package may have been lost and they was able to send me out another one with no problem so I thank Amazon for that!!!,0
Headline says all,0
"Pedí una computadora que ya no estaba en existencia, pero el vendedor fué muy amable al contactarme y ofrecerme otras opciones.Es una PC de segundo uso, trae todos los programas básicos instalados y de entretenimiento, el cargador no funcionó y solicite otro el cual me llegó rápido. Buena atención a pesar de todo",0
perfecr screen and fast worked,0
Been very surprised by the quality and power. Only complaint is you have to have it plugged in or the graphics and processing power sucks.,0
"The way the replacement unit behaved, makes it a likely and very uncomfortable possibility.",0
"My brother loved this laptop. He loves playing online videogames with his friends around the world, and he had burned out so many other laptops because the heat. The cooling system is kinda loud but you wont even hear it when you're playing, specially with good headphones. So far so good ! .",0
Battery NOT great. Everything else about it is good.,0
Received my laptop 5 days ago. The only thing I noticed so far is that the right speaker works and the left one doesn't. Hopefully I can deal with it instead of the hassle to send it back.,0
Battery won’t charge having to send it back for repairs,0
Good value for money. I bought it as a machine for my teenage child to do homework and study with and its pretty good.,0
I can't figure out is how to change the keyboard from breathing lights to a solid color lol,0
"Excelente, es muy rápida justo lo que necesitaba",0
This was a gift for my daughter. She raves about computer. It fits her needs for college. She takes it with her to school and is very thankful for this gift.,0
Description of product said ‘touch screen’ which turned out to be a false statement. Had to return the computer,0
"Simplemente muy buna, no calienta mucho, lo utilizo para edición de videos pesados desde 4k y no se me ha quedado trabado, trabaja muy bien, su sitema de enfriamiento por ventilación son muy bueno, el audio de calidad, envolvente, no se me a alentado desde el día que lo he comprado, todo funcional, su diseño muy bonito y elegante.",0
"Awesome computer... Already upgraded, installing two m.2 SSD's and a 2.5 SSD giving me 6Tb of onboard storage.Only thing it didn't have was a SD card reader",0
So far so good! Very fast.,0
I'm a serious gamer so the hardware gotta be top notch,0
"Compact, extremely light and portable. This is the ideal travel buddy if you just need to keep in touch and be able to conduct virtual transactions on the go. It is a fast little machine, and even though it is tied to Google Chrome, it is not as limiting as I thought it would be. Connects to internet anywhere, allows me to stream video and audio content with ease.",0
"Very nice machine. Fast. A little on the noisy side but it is a gaming laptop, win some lose some. I like that it has an extra m.2 slot and an open SATA ssd bay. Did not like mine came loaded with Windows 11 instead of Windows 10 like stated on the purchase page but I'm just being picky. Sa far as performance it's good enough for almost any game. This will run ( for me at least ) Crisis 3, Witcher 3, Doom Eternal, Portal 2 and Universe Sandbox 2 on max settings and maintain 60fps (as high as my tv goes) with no issues except for the eventual fan noise. Even has a button to turn the fans to full speed on command. I have run Novabech to get some real numbers and the results place the performance of my laptop between the upper level of midrange gaming desktops and entry-level high end gaming desktops. So, I'm satisfied with the purchase.",0
the camera is a little dissapointing given the current technologies.,0
"For the value, clarity, and functionality this computer is the best purchase I’ve ever made.",0
"Before I start, I must say I am really impress with the delivery speed. I ordered this laptop (sold by Amazon and delivered by UPS) the night of Oct. 3rd, and it was delivered the morning of Oct 5th... and I live across the border in Canada! I had originally hoped to get the blue version from Taiwan, but it had been out of stock for weeks, so I got the black one from the States instead.The laptop body is very well built. Slim and full aluminum body, circular metallic pattern and ASUS logo that lights up when turned on, the glass trackpad and fingerprint sensor, ultra-thin bezel, perfect. There are four speakers: two on the sides, and two from the bottom front, resulting in loud and crisp sounds. Hinge resistance is just right as I can open the laptop single-handedly. Screen brightness is slightly darker and feels cooler than my last ASUS laptop (K43S) from 2011, but this is more comfortable for my eyes.Keyboard has slight flex, but sturdy, not as bad as some video online shows. I checked the lightbleed and found there is little to none for my machine, that's great. I do not really use SD cards at all, so the micro SD is a non-issue for me, but some people may not like this design. Performance wise, it's blazing fast. As a graphic designer / full stack developer, this is a perfect machine for my everyday professional work. As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say much about how this machine performs in gaming, so I will leave for others to review that, but for a light gamer this is more than enough. I have not get the time to see how ventilation works under heavy load, but with only two arrays of small vents at the back I suspect it may not be too well.I do have a couple issues with it though. First, the power bar is a giant brick. I did expect a powerful machine to have a bigger AC converter, but the size of it (about three iPhone7s stacked together) still startled me, and it weights about half kg. Second one is a bit troubling: the machine makes some small buzzing sound when some processes are running; it could be the coil whine some people are talking about. It's not loud, but it's audible in a quiet room so I might want to open it up and check one day.The issues aside, this is a very good laptop in terms of quality and performance. This is the laptop of choice for me this year, and I would definitely recommend it for professional users (though probably not gamers).",0
Love it great price and as advertised,0
"Amazing. Its super fast, I can turn in on and be in a game within 3 minutes. The battery doesn't last long on its own but that doesn't bother me",0
"I received an RMA number, but was told it itll be 3-5 business days before they unbox it, and another 10-30 business days for in-house turn around time.",0
Can't even run Netflix,0
"Used it for an apk, and one app. Crashed after 3 months... Very unhappy with product",0
"Not a bad laptop but it depends what you need it for. I needed mine for college and it’s not compatible with Microsoft apps (word, excel) so I needed to return. Otherwise worth the $",0
"Lightweight, great battery, used it for school work, I would buy again",0
"This is an exceptionally well configured laptop for general use plus gaming, video/photo work, and demanding applications. If you work with exceptionally large spreadsheets, like to have 40 tabs open in Chrome, edit videos or photos at an advanced level, and like to relax and game when you can -- this is a fine choice.The system was very nicely packaged and boxed. Setup was quick and easy. This was my first experience with Cortana assisted setup and it was mostly positive. Basic setup took about five minutes. Later it took another 20-30 minutes for all the windows updates to apply, but everything was fairly automatic and worked flawlessly (you have to start the windows updates yourself, which is good). The system seems pretty clean, not loaded with junkware which is great!I tweaked a few power settings to taste and that was about it. The power button does ""sleep"" by default and I left it as is. Though I normally prefer my power button set to shutdown, I left it this way because of the location. It is located right where the DEL key would usually be, so I thought better to leave it set for sleep in case I hit it accidentally (it functions instantly when pressed). Sleep and wake is nearly instantaneous.The screen is sharp and clear. Text at the recommended 125% setting is very readable. The maximum brightness is not as bright as some notebooks I've owned, but seems sufficient for normal indoor use. Not sure about bright sun, could be an issue there as screen is reflective. But that is a minor thing as I rarely use my notebook outdoors.Having a big 512GB SSD is wonderful (I've only had 256GB SSD before this) and 16 GB of RAM is also a big plus. Rarely would anyone ever need more than that. This makes for snappy disk reads and writes and no worries about memory cache and flushing. The SSD has 445 GB free out of 475 GB, normal for this size SSD and windows 10. The SSD is a Samsung which is a highly rated brand and very fast.In my opinion, the 1080p panel is a great fit, especially if you'll be gaming. Although the 4k panel has better color gamut and higher res, the Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti is much better suited for the 1080p resolution. Also, I find the 1080p resolution to be more realistic for everyday work. Viewing angles on the screen seem good and the brightness and colors look fine as well. The 1050 Ti can drive it well for moderate to high gaming (and even Ultra with some games). Almost any 2016 game will run great and most newer games will as well. The Nvidia driver is 376.20 and seems fine. I left things as is for now. [Note: Hard core gamers will want a 1060 or higher card, but this card is fine for me and makes gaming very pleasurable. I have owned many high end gaming rigs in my day. These days, I'm happy just to have fun and not obcess over maximum performance. YMMV.]The fan runs nearly all the time, but is almost inaudible until you are very active. Then the sound is a typical low fan sound and not objectionable. (Silent is always better, but if the fans are going to run, I'm glad they are steady. I've had laptops where the fans cycle up and down all the time and it was very annoying.) I could hear no other noises of any kind in normal use (Have not stress tested yet - will update when I do.) The touchscreen works very well. The keyboard also feels good to me (I'm not a touch typist, however I do type fairly rapidly). No problems with flexing at all. [Note: If you press fairly hard you can make it flex very slightly at the top, but in normal use, I see none.] Layout is mostly standard with a few quirks like the power key and a large Fn key in the lower right.Then you have the truly excellent i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz quad-core processor which blazes and will Turbo-boost to 3.8 GHz! And all of this in a very attractive case. I have always thought Asus made very nice looking laptops and this one is right up there with the best. It has nicely beveled edges and everything feels very solid. No hot spots, everything very cool under normal use. A nice looking rig in my opinion. It even has an illuminated logo! :)I was very happy to see the glass-like (not sure if it's glass or not?) track pad - I love them. So much nicer. And the illuminated keyboard is well done (you can set various brightness levels) and a must at this price point. Then there are the very good speakers and the very generous selection of ports, especially in such a thin notebook.The array of ports on this thing is simply excellent. Getting two USB 3.1 C (Gen 2) Thunderbolt ports is exceptional. While I would have preferred a standard SD card vs. the microSD card (note the description here on Amazon is confusing, but it is microSD, not SD), that's minor and not a real issue for me. (I have several USB 3 card readers on hand.) You also get 2 USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, and an audio jack. Everything you need.The Nvidia GTX 1050Ti with 4 GB of RAM is an excellent choice for the 1080p 15.6"" screen. It can handle this resolution well. It's overkill for most daily activities (and indeed you will often be using the internal Intel GFX vs the 1050Ti), but will be very welcome when you get into demanding apps and games. With about twice the power of a 960M this thing is no slouch. I need to drive external monitors on occasion and the 1050 Ti will be a big help with that, also.Have I mentioned how thin this monster is? For the amount of power you are getting, it's amazing that they could squeeze it into such a thin chasis. The screen hinges work great, easy enough to open, but still stiff enough to support touch use. And it's interesting that it supports the ASUS Pen, a nice plus. I don't have one (yet), but that could add a nice touch later for photo editing, painting/drawing. and such.So, an excellent notebook with many nice features. I will be running more tests and exploring it in more depth and will come back and update this review with my findings as I go. But my ""out of the box"" take is - wow! - fantastic! This thing is pretty much my dream machine, it has everything I've wanted in a great package. It's a very balanced configurationUpdate: Rewrote parts of the above to add more info and clarity. (#2 - a few more updates above.)Update: Battery life -- I have not run a full test as yet, but based on my early use, I would say 8-10 hours is very reasonable to expect for just normal use. I would imagine that will decrease if doing anything that fires up the Nvidia 1050 Ti for long periods. I will have a better take on this in time and I will come back and update based on more experience ASAP. Right now I see 8 hours as almost certain, so will have to see how far above that we can go.-- Here are my best estimates for battery life. These are just educated guesses, based on my light use so far, but I think they should be pretty close. I will update if any changes as I have more experience.---- 8-12 hours mixed use (web browsing, movies, some gaming, other normal uses)-- 8-10 hours movie and video watching-- 3-5 hours gaming or heavy loads-- More than 10 hours light use, web browsing, email. editing documents/spreadsheets, and such-- Note: Since sleep and awaken are very fast, using sleep judiciously could extend these times easily.This is, in my opinion, outstanding for a machine this powerful. I'm very pleased with the battery life I'm seeing.*** Geek Notes: ***The GTX 1050 Ti is about 1/3 faster than the previous 1050. It is not VR ready, you'll need a 1060 for that.The Intel i7 7700HQ supports hyper-threading with up to 8 threads at once - it's an excellent performer.Some people obsess about throttling. I used to also. I don't anymore. My days of spending hours to get a 10% performance increase are over. I'm content to just relax, enjoy, and be happy. The plus is a cooler, lighter, thinner, nicer overall experience vs. a thicker, chunkier, hotter, noisier beast with short battery life. I'm OK with that. [Feel free to disagree, I had a lot of fun tweaking rigs myself, in the past, and understand the need for speed.]",0
Great Laptop works well does everything I need it to do no problem ! Great Seller would do business again !,0
Keyboard lighting is nice.,0
Beautiful piece of tech. BUT MY FAN IS ALWAYS SO LOUD even if I'm just browsing the web. Its so annoying. Didn't notice til after the return date.Edit: Rubber feet got removed 6 months later. What a waste of an expensive laptop.,0
"It's smaller than my last one, so it fits my cooling board. I love that the keyboard can change color. The screen has no glare which is amazing. Never had a laptop that didn't have glare. My games look fantastic, it's almost like starting a new game. I haven't done a lot with is yet, but its worth the money. Very happy I didn't go with the other laptops I was looking at. This is by far the best one I have owned. I love how loud it can get. My last laptop even with the sound all the way up I can't hear the games or shows. Very happy with this laptop. It loads things very fast which is nice. It's much lighter than my last one, so it's easier to move around. Not big and bulky. Very excited to have this. It has an extra fan you can turn on and off if it gets hot as well.",0
"I loved my laptop.. unfortunately I most likely broke it some how while cleaning the fan due to high fan noise. I read the fan sound was loud.. but decided to get it anyway since I'd be able to run it at silent, balanced, or turbo mode .. after a month or two, the fan would run high for no reason even on startup..for hours... Didn't even run anything .. only had my games installed and no heavy usage .. so eventually I tried resetting to factory setting like the Asus tech suggested - worked fine for about 2 days and continued to run high and loud.. tried it again but didn't work... tried going in to bios as well.. exhausted attempts, no success... so my review is at 3 because of the fan noiseLoved everything else about it.",0

Worst computer I have ever bought,0
"4 stars instead of 5 because with my first order, within the first 2 weeks, it would spontaneously shut down. Now if I hadn't bought this on Amazon I would have been in trouble. I packed it up and sent it back for another one. They even let me keep the dysfunctional one until my new one arrived. With the replaced one it has shut itself down only 1x so I don't even count that. Of course, as you saw, it's a Chromebook so it comes with all the simple functuality of that. Does it's job, simple to manage (I'm 64 and only moderately tech savy). Definitely recommend it",0
"The plug has bright blue light that never goes off. It is nice to be able to find the plug, but it never shuts off and it is so bright, not something I would want to keep in my bedroom. It is a mild annoyance.",0

Biggest piece of junk ever. Waste of money,0
"I wanted to like this laptop, and initially I was excited to use it. Immediately upon opening the shipping box I noticed that it was labeled on the physical laptop that it ran windows 10 in S mode. What this means is that any function, download, or App that is not curated from the Microsoft Store will not run in the computer. One can turn off S mode pretty easily but it negatively impacts the speed and performance of the laptop. The specs that the laptop advertises are generated when using S mode, so when turning off S mode, the qualifications the laptop sold you on, can be incorrect. I do not want this feature, and my problem is that this feature was not displayed accurately or, well, even at all on this store page. Had it been mentioned and accurately advertised that this computer ran in S mode, I would not have purchased it.That by itself wouldn't have warranted a review, but this laptop at the time of me writing this, is less than 24 hours old and I'm being notified during the boot sequence that a broken fan (90B) is being detected and continued use of the laptop will result in possible system failure (it will break the system). The fact that this laptop shipped broken, with an obvious fan issue, pushes me to attempt to get a refund. I didn't want to spend time on this, I have enough already in my day but I can't waste money on faulty products and can't spend more to fix something that should have been 100% functional when it was shipped to me. This is probably an unusual event for these laptops, and honestly if it wasn't for the broken fan I would have been content, but again, can't throw money at things that should have worked on reception.",0
great purchase.,0
"I love it so far!!! It feels like a sturdy build, and I really like the thin screen bezels. Good sound, haven't tested it on really game intensive stuff yet but I'll be doing so shortly! I really like the RGB here too. Definitely a huge step up from my previous laptop.",0
"Pros- Good configuration i7 with large FHD screen- USB C with charging and external display and this price point is good- 512 gb SDD and 16GB RAM is a plus- works fast, no issues so far- 1 year warranty gives me peace of mindAreas of improvement- outside look and feel is like budget laptops not aluminum- click pad is just ok- webcam is basic",0

My great grandson uses this for online schooling. Perfect. He is very happy.,0
Shipped fast and exactly as advertised! Definately recomend.,0
The CPU and GPU don't seem to get to hot and the fan noise is tolerable.,0
screen is horrible. but great laptop,0
My old Chromebook was getting old and this is a replacement. Glad I did. This new one is better. Five year old electronics generally have a better new edition.,0
There has to be a problem with the operating system.,0
"As a chromebook it is absolutely worth every penny. After an update of the OS (check for updates before you setup everything as the update deletes all the settings you have made) one can also install Android apps. However..... here comes the crux, ONLY from Google Play store!!! If you want to install Android apps from other locations or business apps, the device needs to be put into developer mode. For the tech savvy this is not that difficult, but has a number of drawbacks when placed in developer mode; 1) Every time the device boots, there is a large warning screen that the device is in developer mode and thus not secure. This screen incurs 30 second delay. 2) The device is no longer in secure mode. 3) If you do switch it back to secure mode, it ""power washes"" (factory reset) everything.However, I did read some rumors recently that Google considers to come with an update that would allow Android apps to be installed from non-Google-Play stores without developer mode.",0
It discreet . It doesnt scream gaming from miles.So you can easily use it for the office also.Very fast very powerfull.The only downside is that its heavy. I put it in my backpack with the power brick and its heavy.But this is what you get for a powerfull gaming laptop.Overall i would suggest it with no second thoughts.,0
It can run most of my games pretty fast. I hope to continue to try Acer’s products.,0
Fast and eaay to upgrade,0
The laptop is pretty good for playing games however the biggest downside to this one is that it gets very hot and you'll notice the heat during long gaming sessions and the fan is VERY loud so wear some headsets because you'll have a hard time hearing the game with the fan blowing and keep it plugged in as the battery life isn't long if left unplugged.,0
The per key lighting is awesome.,0
"I was looking for a cheap laptop and was swayed by online reviews to give the Chromebook a try. This was the easiest computer set up I have ever experienced. I opened the box, plugged the Chromebook in for about 30 minutes, hit the power button, logged into my Google account and that was it, set up was done. It is everything I need for computing on the couch that my phone can't do.",0

"Disclaimer: I bought this at walmart in store, not amazon. I'm not faulting the vender, just the manufacturer of the product.I know a bunch of you guys are raving about this product because you had it for years, but the newer ones do not last long at all. I had it for 3 months (the date it was made was 12/16, I bought it 02/17 and it wouldn't work on 05/17). I took excellent care of it before the battery would no longer charge. There's nowhere to buy the battery either, unless you want to go straight to the manufacturer and buy it for $50. I was thinking that I wouldn't need the warranty when I moved so I tossed it, before I had problems with it. That was a huge mistake. If you decide to buy it, keep the warranty. I'm not sure how they deal with fixing or reimbursing their products. I just don't want anybody who buys this from amazon thinking amazon is purposely sending faulty product. I've read countless reports on the newer ones having battery problems, so it's not just me.",0

The keyboard was silver and the letters on the keys were white so I could not see them. The picture of the computer on Amazon had a black keyboard with white letters and backlight. The backlight on the keys kept going off. I gave up on it and removed my info from it and sent it back. Shipping too and from has been very slow. I am waiting for my refund.....",0
I have now purchased TWO of these laptops and neither worked. Screen flickering when not plugged in to the point it's unusable. I have done trouble shooting but this is ridiculous for a computer I haven't even gotten to use yet. Constantly logs me out when its not plugging in. Completely unusable. Screen flickers even when plugged in. I have done all the trouble shooting possible and the fact its due to a ERROR IN THE DESIGN due to the ram door is unacceptable for a computer that costs this much. DO NOT BUY. You can do better. Very disappointed.,0
"I am not a tech guy but this is a much better computer than my old one.I generally use my computers for email, surfing the web, zoom meetings and school.This Acer computer has performed beyond my expectations.The wifi connection is quick, applications always open fast.I really like the lit keyboard for working in darker areas.The finger scanner is great for security, works perfectly.The body is made of metal not plastic like my old computer, the hinges aresolid.The screen is fairly good looking, colors are bright and no problems with dead pixels.I am not a fan of the windows operating software as I have used Apple in the past and really like it a-lot.As usual with windows this computer comes with bloat items that I have no interest in using.The speakers are not great if you are wanting flawless sound from music or movies but that is to beexpected from a pc is this price range.This swift 3 is very light and easy to carry around the house or take on the go.",0
"I purchased this laptop to replace my 2016 Acer swift 3 ultrabook class laptop. I got this laptop because it offers far more performance and upgrade paths than my previously laptop.So far here's what I likeThe boot time is very fast takes a few seconds.The keyboard is great, there is no flex and typing feels great. The keyboard back lighting gets sufficiently bright and allows for 3 brightness toggles.The internals of this laptop allows for a lot of upgrades. I purchased the i5 model and the after opening the laptop I found an empty hard drive bay and an empty ram slot. The screen can also be upgraded if you don't like the TN panel. I plan on upgrading my screen to IPS in a few days since it seems like a fairly easy process.Also this laptop is great for gaming. Since the screen has such a high ppi you can pretty much leave off AA and get 60 fps on high settings on all games. Even demanding games like battlefield 1 run great.Fan noise while gaming isn't too loud and the laptop doesn't feel hot. Having the extra air intakes on the bottom of the laptop helps a lot with thermals.The screen also gets pretty bright. You won't have any annoying screen reflections when using indoors and is even fine for some outdoor usage.Here's what I don't like about this laptopThe track pad definitely has some issues. Out of the box I couldn't use two finger scrolling since it kept getting confused with the pinch to zoom gesture. So I had to disable pinch to zoom entirely. Now it works about most of the time but not 100%. Also sometimes when I'm using the track pad it'll just stop responding to my finger an the mouse cursor will stay in place. This is pretty annoying and happens a lot more than it should. Also to top it off the track pad just feels really plasticity and cheap.The screen is a TN panel so the colors look pretty dull and the vertical viewing angles are horrible. However the viewing angles from the side are almost as good as IPS.Overall I'm pleased with this laptop and would recommend it if you looking for a thin and light gaming laptop. However this laptop isn't perfect out of the box, you gotta be willing to take it apart and upgrade it to get the best experience.",0
"One year after purchasing, the screen on this laptop completely died. Have been told the internal wires were inappropriately or badly placed. The computer still works, but the screen doesn't.

"I'm an IT guy so having a machine that is powerful but agile is important to me. I upped the RAM to 32Gb of DDR4-2933. Since it does not do XMP, DDR4-3200 will not run full speed.

"Runs fast, boots up almost immediately. My only issue is that the screen is really bad.The main issue with the screen is viewing angle. I think some other people have brought up that many of the positive reviews are of the previous model year (same model, a year prior) which had a much better screen. Viewed from below perpendicular it gets dark very quickly. Viewed from above perpendicular and it washes out almost immediately. View head on and the top will be dark while the bottom is bright and washed out. Using the home screen and bright apps it's not too bad, but trying to watch videos it's unbearable.",0
"A lot of gaming laptops are very flashy, with RGB lights or other gimmicks. This looks like a chunky but non-nonsense laptop but is also a decent entry-to-mid-level gaming machine.Gaming on a laptop is always a tradeoff. There's always a balance that must be struck between power, price, and the ability to shed waste heat, and being in a portable factor only complicates things.The tradeoffs here aren't major, but there are some.The graphics card is good, but not high-end. You will be able to play every current game I can think of, but you can't max all the settings. That's expected on any gaming laptop.Price-wise, this machine isn't at all bad for what you get. As soon as you start to add gaming components to a laptop the price shoots up dramatically, but HP has kept costs down by avoiding the gimmicks other manufacturers throw in their machines. (Compare to a Dell Alienware, for example.)Instead, they give you things you can actually use. A nice, oversized trackpad. A backlit keyboard that has a decent feel and a numeric keypad, and a screen with good (but not amazing) brightness.There are a few oversights, in my opinion. There's only a single USB-C port, and the A ports are limited in speed compared to the modern 3.1 standards. This is a failure to think about the future that I would have thought wouldn't have been an expensive upgrade to include. At the very least, a USB-C port on each side would have been nice. Also, a fingerprint reader would have been great.The SSD is undersized for a gaming machine. 512GB is fine for a business-class machine, but a handful of triple-A games will use up most of that space too easily. And there's apparently no second slot, so you have to go to the trouble of replacing the base drive if you want to upgrade. A second slot would have been a no-brainer on a gaming laptop.Those issues aren't enough to detract that the machine is a good deal for the price. The build feels solid (though heavy), and even when the fans are running at full speed they're not distracting.The sound quality is good. It's not audiophile-grade but it's loud and clear. The screen is quite bright for a laptop. The high refresh rate is the draw for gamers. Viewing angles are okay.Battery life - well, you're not going to actually do much gaming on this machine when disconnected from power. Honestly, I haven't run a test, but if you're actually using anything that pushes the GPU up, you're going to drain the battery extremely quickly. When you're not gaming, battery life isn't great either. I haven't run the battery all the way dead, but after only 1 hour of very light usage (and near max screen brightness), I was already around 50%, so my guess is 2 hours tops, and even less with any serious usage.This laptop is fairly heavy, and the power brick is big and bulky too. (It has to be since it's rated for 200 watts.) You can't charge off of USB-C. (I tried with two different 100-watt PD power supplies, and the battery was still discharging while the machine was idle.) So this laptop isn't even close to an all-day machine without bringing the charger, but that's expected in a large-screen gaming laptop.The caveats in this device apply to most gaming laptops.The shortlist of the biggest pros and cons:Pro:No flashy gimmicks.Solid, (but not stellar) gaming performance.Decent price for a gaming laptop.Solid build.Fans operate at a reasonable noise level.Cons:Ports are lacking.SSD is a bit small for a gaming-focused machine, without the option of adding a second SSD.Heavy and you will need the bulky power adapter if you actually travel with this (which is a common fault in all gaming laptops.)",0
"Refurbished business use laptop, does the job so far, solid and a little on the heavy side but works.",0
loads pretty quick and runs the programs I need pretty smoothly.,0
"I was very happy with the laptop for almost 3 weeks when the screen didn't wake up after sleep mode. After turning it again the problem persisted so I contacted Lenovo for warranty. The problem is apparently I don't have coverage because I bought the computer in US and now I'm in another country. The computer can be a good machine (maybe I just had bad luck with a unnusual defect) but It's a bad experince since I'm still trying to figure how to return, change, refund or make the warranty valid. 0 for customer and warranty support from Lenovo.Update: Then the next day its working again, hope was some software issue.",0
"It works for what I do, so I am very happy with it.",0
"Hasta ahora muy buen producto, llegó bien empaquetado y antes de lo previsto",0
"Es una computadora ligera, delgada, con un color muy bonito y llamativo, su monitor es de lo mejor, es antireflejo y no lastima la vista. El Windows 11 instalado me agradó, la rapidez es aceptable, no la he explotado al máximo pero creo que no me decepcionará.",0
So far this computer works great ... i am happy with my purchase,0
"This is the shortest time I've ever had a laptop before I had to buy another one. After two years and two weeks, the keyboard hardware crashed. Between the cost of repair and the wait time to get it fixed, I ended up buying a new laptop -and of course I went with a different brand. I liked it while it worked.",0
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She puts all her school apps on it and does her home work,0
Bought this laptop before my last deployment. Worked very smoothly. Battery life is very short however but that's expected for a gaming laptop. I can get about 3 hours of casual browsing and streaming videos 100% battery. I can get about 1 hr of gaming on low settings before having to plug it in. Worth the buy.,0
"Although the colors on this product are not vivid, that is a minor problem compared to the sound. I have checked all settings for increasing sound and have them on max; however, even with earbuds, the sound is quite low. I have looked into getting help from Asus in case I am missing something, but they want you to sign up for a program that they charge for. What???? No thanks.",0
"Just got the computer last night. Seems pretty good besides one small, but very often used feature: the speakers. They're so quite and so poor. If you've ever got a keychain bluetooth speaker as a RiteAid impulse buy for $8, you've gotten better sound than this computer. Ugh... is deleting all my already imputed info, then boxing it up, printing a label, and shipping it back worth the lack of speaker quality... Just maybe!!",0
This one has one the highest performing 3060 in the market right now.Performs on par with most 3070 laptops due to it being 115w vs some 90w 3070's out there.Arous Control Center is a mess and the AI features are annoying as hell.It detects Visual Studio as a high performance tasks and revs the fans up 200% ridiculous.Everytime you launch a game it goes into gaming mode and shifts your keyboard to rainbow puke.Give yourself some time to set it up correctly or disable it entirely.After some tweaking i was able to set control center to my liking.Battery life is great considering its a high performance machine.,0
"El producto llegó en tiempo y forma, cumple con la descripción del vendedor, considero que es una laptop que cumple con la calidad y precio. Estoy satisfecho con mi compra",0
Great for my 11 year old,0
Great customer service The guy helped me to decide which other chuwi product can I get for me,0
"Looks really professional, you can take this to the office without catching glares.",0
I purchased this item for my 15 year old granddaughter to use in class. We were both disappointed on Christmas day when it did not work. I purchased another PC at Best Buys because she really wanted the PC. I have since returned the subject item and have been refunded. Thanks.,0
"The laptop I got was a windows 8 model, not a Windows 10 pro model as advertised and was not in English. I had to have my tech upgrade to windows 10 and formate it to English. If I was not pressed for time, I would have sent it back. Will update on how the laptop runs...",0
"The good first:Price. This is a very affordable laptop for what is included.Speed. I use this for graphic design, photoshop, and some light gaming. It can do pretty big photoshop actions faster than my more robust desktop computer. It is a very fast little machine.The bad:It gets hot. The laptop itself doesn't feel hot, but the CPU pretty consistently hits 60 degrees Celsius doing mundane tasks like checking email. After gaming for 10 minutes, both the CPU and GPU can creep up to dangerously high temperatures. As some other reviewers have stated, it might have to do with poor thermal pasting.The keyboard and track pad suck. I use a USB keyboard because the one on the laptop is nearly useless. The track pad is overly sensitive and often while typing the cursor will jump around because I hovered too close to the trackpad.For the price, I don't mind the issues. It is very capable of doing the kind of work I previously could only do on my desktop computer. So for my needs, it's more than adequate. I definitely don't regret this purchase.",0
"This product is originally listed for $549.00. Sure I didn’t pay that, but this product is in no way worth the listing price. I wish I would have gone and gotten one with a bigger screen too. Overall, it was kind of a letdown....",0
"La marca ya es garantía, buen dise?o.Se está usando en México y no confirmé que el teclado estuviese en espa?ol. no tiene “?”.Buen precio.",0

"I am overall very satisfied with my 2020 Apple MacBook Air purchase. Every works smooth and no problems so far. Powerful laptop. For now, I highly recommend.",0
my machine isn't even displaying my RTX 2060 in device manager,0
Specs are amazing and everything else about this laptop is worth every penny,0
I m happy with my purchase,0
"The laptop work great the screen looks great , but the battery life even on just video playback is at most 2hs not even close to what is says on the description",0
"Bought this for my 9yr old daughter that is homeschooled, she works online for core subjects. This laptop is light weight, keypad lights up. Was in very nice shape, it's more than fast enough for our needs. Arrived as promised.",0
"I use it for EVERYTHING: business, personal & even my children’s school work! It had been an absolutely amazing tool for us!!",0
The packaging was very professional and neat. The only thing I noticed right out of the box is that the front right fan is making a vibrating noise and the battery life isn't that good. But overall the computer is very sleek and clean and quick,0
"This little computer Rocks!! Super fast and does everything I need it to do, and I have a job in the tech industry so, ya.",0
"Perfect CPU and GPU combination, powerful enough but not super hot.",0
"The laptop's performance was alright, what was expected given the price of the laptop. But the screen showed issues since I first turned it on, it seemed that it was not plugged in correctly or it had gotten loose from the other components. Screen would go black while the system's online and it would need to be restarted multiple times to fix but even so it would not get fixed sometimes. I would say avoid buying ASUS TUF products, their products will work at first but always show problems on the long run and in some cases in the short run as well.",0
Exceeds my expectations! Decent upper midrange gaming beast. I'm completely satisfied.,0
The plug broke in the machine... for the second time. Sending it back and won’t ever buy a Samsung because over and over they cheap out. Will be sending back as soon as I can get to UPS.,0
Excellent laptop for its price. Back to school top,0
"I was so excited to get my ""PREDATOR"". I grabbed the Amazon box, opened it up and viewed my first bona-fide game system of this kind. Like a kid in a candy store, I could not get to my new experience fast enough. After opening up my holy grail of gaming systems, charging her up and hitting the on button....... I waited....... And Waited....... And waited....... Finally, she fired up and came to life. It was like having a lightning bolt rain down on you, yet, land gently in your lap. It was intoxicating for about five seconds. That's when it turned off and never started back up. I called The Predator Premium Service line to ask how this could have happened and what to do next. Sadly, ACER told me, ""um, I'd call AMAZON, they can help you better then we can at this point"". HOLY SMOKES PEOPLE. I just needed a little PREDATOR love. Finally, I called AMAZON and was helped in the way that only AMAZON can help. We'll see what happens with round two.",0
"Small, compact and perfect for my 2 teenage boys!!! They do a ton of online homework and this is perfect for them. Highly recommend for homework use no matter what the age!!! Easy to take with and do homework on the go too!!",0
product quality,0
Love my Flex5. Has performed superbly. My only concern is the battery died after 2 and half years.,0
Not a touchscreen,0
Amazing laptop,0
Wifi stopped working on the laptop.,0
Nice screen but doesnt work very well,0
"It runs The Sims, Magic, Adobe illustrator, and steam games without any lag. My siblings use it for remote learning and have no complaints. Not too big, not too small. I'm very happy with this. Battery is decent, if I'm browsing the internet I'll get 6-7 hours, if I'm gaming or using zoom I'll get around 4.",0
This laptop is half the weight for about three times the power,0
"I got 2 of these for my son's. 1 works great. The other terrible. The HD fried and required mother board repair, and the graphics also had been a chore to get working properly. I tried contacting the seller but no answer, had to take it to a repair shop.",0
"Estuve buscando varios días un buen equipo, tenía distintas opciones, pero de forma inesperada me apareció éste, y decidí optar por él.El paquete llegó en orden, bastante rápido. Es un equipo increíble, el precio muy bueno también. Estoy muy agusto con mi compra, 100% recomendada.",0

"I had a lot of trouble using an RCA version of a book but this Samsung Chromebook works wonderfully on Wi-Fi. Haven't tried to use it any other way I am able to use the Windows 10 products I am used to, and the Chrome products I am used to, and they sink perfectly. Samsung has a lot of speed compared to the RCA product that I had so much problems with.",0
"This is a stunning machine. Perfect for email, research and media machine. 10/10.",0
"If you ate looking to download external software, DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER.I bought this Computer for my father for Christmas, for him to use to digitize old VHS Tapes. I did not know that Crome computers WILL NOT Download any External software.I returned it to the NEXT DAY.",0
"Elegant, sleek design, gorgeous 4K display and it's very powerful for an Ultrabook.",0
"This is really a high quality machine. The price I paid almost reflected that quality, but I snagged it when an incredible deal was running. The m3 processor is more than enough power to do regular tasks that anyone does online plus all the productivity work that is needed in a workplace. My wife is a teacher and this was purchased for her, so most of this feedback is from what she's said as she's used it.First, let's talk about the display. It really is a beautiful display with accurate-enough colors. It gets a little over-saturated in some situations and under-saturated in others, creating some awkward hue on backgrounds of darker movies or webpages. But those are only noticeable while objects are moving (or when you're scrolling) and there's a lot of action on the screen. It gets bright enough for most situations and in the previous Pro model I wondered why it got as bright as it did. Watching reviews it seemed like you almost don't need to use a lamp to lighten a room, just turn the display face up and turn it up; that should be plenty to light an entire bedroom.Second is the quality of the material. The device feels like a brushed aluminum or other metal material with some plastic in some places. This is about right for the price, considering an even better quality of material would get you easily spending $900+. The keyboard feels fantastic and the touchscreen hasn't had a single hiccup yet after about 2 months of use.Third, let's talk about functionality. And, before we begin, let's remember this is a Chromebook. This wasn't purchased to play the latest games or sync with Microsoft or Apple services. It's a Samsung product running a Google operating system, meaning that it's meant to work with Google services. That said, it works wonderfully for Google Drive (word processing, spreadsheets, etc.). This item is used almost exclusively to do lesson planning, grading, research, and other tasks that a teacher would do. For that, it's perfect. The only real issues we've had entail poor web design and a lack of websites switching to HTML5 instead of Flash.All in all, if you're wanting the performance of a Google Pixelbook and similar functionality then you won't be disappointed. If you want to get a loved one a computer that will really allow them to use the Internet without too much worry about viruses, then you're making a good purchase. If you're intending to get a laptop that can run Android apps without too much of a ""herky jerky"" experience, then you're making a good purchase. If you're wanting a computer that can run Photoshop, render 4K videos, or anything like that, then you're better off with other products.",0
"I purchase this Chromebook for school, and I am loving it so far. I easily set up all the same apps I have on my Samsung that I would need, as well as the apps required for my online courses with no issue. The quality is very nice. It was a little slow out of the box, but after updates and installations were said and done, it cruises through everything without issue. My only gripe is the touch screen sensitivity. Unless I'm using the pen, the screen doesn't always recognize touch. I have had to touch the screen multiple times on a few occasions in order for it to register that I'm clicking something. I have also had issues when note taking with the pen where my arm will touch the toolbar at the bottom of the screen while I'm writing and open other apps or zoom in/out of what I'm doing. An annoyance, but it's not a deal breaker for me. I'm not sure if there's a way to hide the toolbar, but I feel that would solve my issues. The casing is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but easily wipes off so no harm no foul. Overall I would recommend this device.",0
"Unable to connect to WI-FI. And it has a problem just like this. In other words, I can't use it on campus at all. I'm getting it returned. Hope next one wouldn't be like this awful.",0
"Quite nice laptop. Arrived in its original package with all all the stickers and the power brick. Been using & testing every inches of it since 14 June 2022, absolute amazed & don't regret buying this laptop at all. Totally worth the money I spent on this laptop.About the thunderbolt port, didn't get the chance to test it yet. About the screen, there is not much bleeding, the color & brightness is ok, however don't update to the latest intel UHD graphic driver as it will render the screen color & brightness totally inaccurate, had to revert back to the old version. The performance is incredible, didn't test the MUX switch yet. The keyboard & touchpad is quite nice, everything placed perfectly, the RGB & its brightness is quite nice, sad that it doesn't support per-key RGB.Runs a little bit hot with the fan a little bit loud when doing stuff like gaming & other things that requires high processing power, but that's OK, It is bearable.Had an issue with the microphone as was too loud & inaccurate in the receiver end, had to use an earphone with external mic. Thought it was a hardware issue, but after a bit of research, uninstalled the C-Media Audio Driver & reinstalled all of it through My Asus software. Easy process & now works perfectly.",0
"Great battery life. So easy to set up. The picture is incredible, my partner wishes is gaming laptop was like it.",0
In Battery Saver Mode you're looking at 3.5 hrs of life.... Will need to upgrade to 80w battery unless you are planning on keeping this thing plugged in all the time or use in short bursts. Unfortunately the 80w battery seems to be sold out everywhere.,0
"This is truly amazing for $1,000. Runs most games great and is high quality. Don’t miss out on this",0
"This is not a bad laptop considering the fact that you’re getting a design very similar to Apple’s MacBook Pro. They couldn’t come up with something else other than making something looks almost exactly like a MacBook Pro. Asus is getting worse every year. Few devices I bought last year, were disappointing.",0
i am a student and i use heavy software and even thou it has ''just'' i5 i am very satusfied with it.,0
"This is a great gaming laptop that has incredible specs (16gb ram, RTX 2070 & high refresh screen) without having to empty out your wallet completely. I've been able to run a lot of high FPS games so far without issues and can't say enough about how good the games look.Besides your gaming needs, the laptop has the capabilities of doing anything else you normally want from a laptop.However, as with most gaming laptops, if you plan to push the specs to their limits, you probably want to keep the laptop plugged in or the charger close to you.",0
"i've only had this laptop 2 months and its already messing up,it doesn't want to turn on and just shuts off by its self.",0
"Looks great, works great, is lightweight and portable, and gets the job done.",0
Nice laptop for the price,0
"This product met my expectations. I use it to run software for my Laser Engraver. i bought an external Docking device that allows me to have more USB ports, and an Ethernet port as well as a few more.",0
"For what I need, this is perfect. I have Zoom meetings on it and the screen quality is great. Watching a video the resolution is 1080hd. The camera quality is 720hd. Far and beyond better than my old laptop that died after many years of use. Since it does not have a built-in CD/DVD player, it is very light weight. I just purchased an external drive which is quite inexpensive. Glad I bought this.",0
"- Very good build materials, doen't feels cheap.- Keyboard feels pretty good for a Laptop and it's full RGB- Fans aren't loud during gaming- Battery it's good enough for non-gaming tasksI just love it.Would recommend",0
"It’s overall pretty good but when i just got it there’s lots of random bugs like the keyboard backlight is on but my screen is not functioning but after like 10 min it’s fine and when i charges it wont charge and then i realize u have to customize it, overall aurous’ system is very weird to use but the laptop overall is good",0
"The screen on this laptop is great. Sharp, clear, and the thin bezel is slick.",0
Did not receive instructions of how to navigate through the different options and does not have touchscreen capabilities.,0
Tons of preinstalled bloatware.,0
This laptop works but cannot handle photoshop and multiple monitors and the biggest issue PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS: the 16GB of RAM cannot be upgraded. You are stuck with limited capacity because the motherboard cannot be upgraded past 16GB ram according to the HP documentation. It works and runs fine but if you want to do multitasking or streaming or real gaming this IS NOT THE LAPTOP for any of that. It should not be called a gaming laptop.,0
I love this laptop. It’s so lightweight and easy to use. I do a lot on it for work and school and have had no issues with storage capacity and it’s super fast. Great resolution.The USB port only sometimes works which is annoying. I’ve done some research and not sure if it’s a trend with this type of laptop or what but you have to hold down to power button to almost trip it back into working. I don’t often use my USB so I haven’t gotten it fixed yet but it is a concern when getting a laptop online since there’s no in person tech support to bring it to.,0
I had this chrome book in my classroom for three month and it completely died. I do not recommend this computer.,0
It was just what I needed,0
"For a few days was a nice Chromebook, then doesn't start or power up again, don't buy it, and is not a cheap Chromebook, is USD200 exactly what this is. First and Last Time I bought any ASUS device, next time I will buy DELL That always have real GLOBAL WARRANTY not only US WARRANTY and I forgot the Chine ASUS junk",0
"This thing is fast. Its got the bells AND the whistles. Best purchase I have ever made on Amazon, hands down.",0
"The Nitro 5 feels like a quality laptop. It feels perfect for a slightly above entry level gaming laptop. The only complaint and why I didn't give it 5 stars, is it runs pretty hot. I recently replaced the stock thermal paste with high quality paste meant to handle even extreme setups. It brought the cpu temp down about 8°. Diablo 3, The Witcher 3, FFXIV, etc.. All runs at a decent temp on higher settings. FFXV turns my Nitro into a supernova at medium settings even with the new thermal paste (will frequently spike to 93°-96°). Other than that it'll play any new game on the market at medium graphics with a decent fps and it'll play most games at medium to max settings at a good fps. I'd recommend replacing the stock thermal paste asap.All in all, for the price I would highly recommend this laptop. Just don't expect to be playing something like Cyberpunk higher than medium with anything higher than 30-40 fps.",0
this is a fine laptop that very much swings above its weight class it runs cool and silent when in any day to day use. When gaming it handles it shockingly well although the fans get a bit loud when its working hard. all in all I cant imagine there is anything in this price range that outshines it.,0
"I purchased this to replace my 13 year old Asus laptop which was used for general web surfing, social media, emailing, photo retouching, and Word/powerpoint/excel projects.This HP is everything I needed, and more! Windows 11 is much more user-friendly than Windows 10. The speed at which this machine operates is phenomenal. It starts up quick, and holds a charge for at least 8 hours.Best of all, it's lightweight and thin, so traveling is a breeze.Bonus: it is bluetooth compatible, so I can make/answer phone calls and check my text messages with my phone in the next room.Another bonus: numeric keypad!The only thing that would make this laptop better would be a back-lit keyboard, but I'm not sweating the small stuff.",0
"I got this pc for like 580 and if you can get it for that price definitely go for it.Vibrant screen, cool design and cute keyboard backlight. Battery life isn't that great, but you're supposed to play games while it's connected so, no issues. It runs Dota2 on medium/high perfect, I limited it to 60fps and it almost never goes under that. It runs Overwatch on medium/high perfect at 60fps. I am often moving cities and countries so, this pc really came in handy, it's not that heavy, it is pretty. Welp I feel satisfied in general. I'm just looking forward to upgrade the ssd storage but for now. I am pretty sure 256 is enough because I don't play that many games. For the price I got an entry level gaming laptop that fits my needs when I'm traveling. If you made it this far then I recommend you to check your needs, if you're willing to have an entry level gaming laptop this is a good deal (for the price I paid)",0
"Computer is running horribly slow and now won't shut off. I could normally take the battery out but even pressing the reset button, it stays ""on"" without the screen Turing on. Avoid. I. Glad I have insurance and a chance to return.",0
"Gorgeous, functional and very powerful laptop",0
"My particular job requires the use of many VMs running all at once, so I was really keen on getting a laptop with an i9 processor. Looking in that market, anything with an i9 is easily $2K and onward. I picked this laptop up on the recent Amazon Black Friday deal for $1,649.99 which was an absolute steal! I'm a big fan of the sleek black thin look (which is not common among some of the other gaming laptops like Alienware) along with the option to disable the extra lighting (it looks great with it on). It's just a personal preference of mine to not have my laptop look like a Christmas tree in a professional work environment. I just threw MW2 on here and it runs maxed out with a solid 60 fps throughout. This truly is an all-in-one package for me in terms of work and play. I went out of my way to upgrade my ram to 64 GB for the purposes of running multiple VMs and it runs fantastically. My only caveat (but this is common now-a-days with these manufactured laptops) is the little amounts of bloatware that was present in the operating system; but that was a quick uninstall. All in all, fantastic product with a great build, I am really glad I pulled the trigger on this purchase.",0
"Very much surprised. Fast start up with no lag time. Includes Windows 10, blue tooth, wifi and lighted key board. Does not include HDMI socket and no external keys to dim the screen. This needs to be done through settings. Aside from that it has turned out to be a very good deal for the price at any cost. Will diffenately purchase another before they are all gone.",0
"The computer's appearance is very exquisite, and the metallic texture is excellent. I suggest adding a waterproof function, with safe waterproofing within 10 meters, so you don't have to worry about the computer getting wet in extreme environments, at least not worrying about the situation where a water cup next to the computer spills.",1
"Item was packaged well, but was not operational when received. HP customer support suggested to return the computer and wait for over a week on a repaired computer.",0
"The entire Razer experience was terrible. The USB port on my machine snapped after 5 weeks. I sent it for repair, I was told I had to pay $1300 dollars for it to be fixed. When I declined I heard nothing for 8 days. On live chat I was stalled and told they would come back to me. They never did. When I went on for the 5th time a manage offered me 25% discount.. so $900 to repair a piece of plastic on a 5 week old machine. I have asked for it to be returned.. I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BACK. So Razer have my laptop and are holding me to ransom. WORST WORST WORST - on top of that the machine itself was only average for the money.",0
The laptop was well packaged,0
THE TABLET IS EASY TO USE AND THE BATTERY IS GOOD,0
Did not have touch screen was older version not what I ordered,0
Excellent value.,0
"I've got a Windows 10 desktop, an Android tablet, and an Android phone. Wanting a laptop and not necessarily another Windows machine, I thought I'd try Chrome OS. Wow, I'm impressed so far, set up was an easy, quick process, about ten minutes. To me, when web browsing, it reminds me of Windows and the file manager more like Android in how to move files around etc, which I'm comfortable with, although Windows Explorer is okay too. I had a mouse plugged in at first because it was easier to use during setup, but now I've read the manual and have learned how to do everything with the track pad, which works well and keeps the computer highly portable. The best is it has no bloatware on it like some devices, my version has 4 gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of internal storage, along with the micro SD card I installed gives me way more potential than i need. In short, so far i love this device. How can they pack so much value in, i paid $179.00 delivered. My .02 cents at least. Cheers.",0
"After sending back my other computer (an Acer) I paid the extra 100$ and got this guy for gaming. After 30 minutes of updates....It blew my mind how awesome this machine is. The keyboard lighting is fully customizable. It has overclock setting built in so you do not have to crash your computer a bunch of times to get it right. I play all my games on Ultra and it is 100fps+. I am so glad I went with the Predator and will be staying with this from now on. Also, I will be installing a 1tb SSD in the empty slot to add more space. Can't say enough good things about how light, stylish and out of the box ready for gaming it is!",0
"the keys have a porous surface which tend to capture oils and they wear quickly, starting from the first day",0

"This is a good laptop for kids who dont need to download applications, I had to return mine the because it comes with something called ""S mode"" so i couldnt do my work on it because i was unable to download the things i need!",0
Waste of money. Bought this for my son’s distance learning and audio functions are not compatible with video platforms such as Zoom.,0
Only 2 weeks into using it and all is good so far. I’ve had HP laptops in the past and have had good experiences. I think this will also be a good purchase.,0

"I purchased a Lenovo X1 Carbon (i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD HD) after having some hardware issues with other work laptops. I needed a high end, limited frills, portable laptop to do heavy duty business work on. And not much else. I don't play games or watch movies on this, I don't do graphics or rendering work. I don't code. Other than work (heavy duty office-suite use, software used through browsers, etc.) all I need this computer for is an occasional youtube video.What I've dealt with since receiving this machine has turned me off from Lenovo forever. The computer itself is as advertised…light, powerful, simple. No touch screen, the keyboard is decent, everything else is great. So far I'd give it a B+.EXCEPT yesterday it started having charging issues after 15 days of use. The computer isn't charging correctly, it's indicating it's connected when it's not, and it's telling me that the power cord I have is the wrong wattage for this computer. Even though it's a) not, and b) been working fine since I got it. And my external monitor flashes on and off. According to the Lenovo client, all of my stuff is up-to-date and working correctly.Enter Lenovo's superior customer support team to fix my issues right away.JUST KIDDING.Enter Lenovo's frustrating but navigate-able menu and (wait for it)….A SALES AND SUPPORT TEAM THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM 9PM EST ON FRIDAY UNTIL 9AM EST ON MONDAY.Can you imagine? A company with an enterprise value north of $13BN, and they won't pay for support on the weekends. Un-freaking-believable.Furthermore, the support staff I talked to (before they locked up the office for the weekend) said that the turn-around time to repair my computer would be 7 business days. Like, no big deal, right? I'll just use pen and paper for a week and a half while my two-week-old computer maybe gets fixed.Or I could talk to sales about getting a new one sent to me, so I can spend a few hours getting my new computer set up and the old one wiped then sent back to you. Oh, but they don't work on the weekends either. (You CAN, however, order a new product by talking to someone through chat on the weekends, but no sales support or technical support.)OR I could take my computer to a certified Lenovo repair site. I live in the SF Bay Area…hardly the middle of nowhere.There is one location within an hour of me.And it's closed on the weekends.There's one more right at an hour from me. I'm not sure if it's open on the weekends. They didn't answer their phone and their website hasn't been updated since 2009.So here I am, wasting my Saturday and NOT spending time with my family because I'm trying to resolve computer issues on a brand new computer with a giant corporation that has 0 resources available to support me on the weekends, as I prepare to get on the road for work tomorrow for a week. Fortunately, I'll be back….late Friday.JUST IN TIME FOR THEM TO CLOSE UP SHOP FOR THE WEEKEND AGAIN.ThinkPad products might be great. I'm not sure. I've heard decent things. But if you end up with a lemon, better start blocking off big chunks of time on your calendar to fix it yourself, because you're going to be left high and dry by Lenovo. Because who really cares about the little guy, right? It's just some shmuck who bought a $2500 laptop computer from an IBM owned company.",0
"When I first received the laptop, I was not able to turn it on and had to plug it into an outlet. Something interesting I noticed is that the laptop feels slightly heavier after I charged it comparing to how I felt when I first took it out of the box.The laptop is lightweight, and the metallic look doesn't make it look cheap. When you open the lid, it will push the laptop slightly off from the surface below. Since the speaker is down-facing, you might hear echoes depending on the material of the surface below it. I felt a bit weird about the audio at first but get used to it after a short period of time. Also, the laptop sometimes can make high-pitched noises. Since it doesn't happen very often and is barely noticeable, it's not a big deal for me. The battery performance is not very impressive. Light gaming (playing Fall Guys) for an hour drained 35% of the battery. One more thing I noticed is that if I have a YouTube page opened before I put the laptop to sleep, the next time I turn it on, the video will get stuck with a white screen. Waiting a bit or refreshing the page will help, but that's kind of annoying. Overall, it's still a good laptop for normal office work.",0
"While the performance is great, it is very unstable and lacks many features.So I won't talk about performance here because it delivers, it can play all the games very good on high settings.But it is very unstable.-From time to time it freezes, or I get a black screen out of nothing.-Sometimes when I connected it to an external monitor or projector through HDMI there is no video, but you can see the menu and in the case of Netflix the name of the show, rating and the playback buttons, hear the sound, but the screen is black. This happened more than once at random with different HDMI cables.-It is constantly updating and sometimes it gets stuck after it restarts.And it also lacks too many things in order to be usable for other things other than gaming-Does not have a camera-It is not touch screen-Does not have an SD card slot. It just have 3 USB ports.So, while its performance for games is too good, it should not cost over $2000.",0
"I was very pleased and excited when I first received this product. I'm not a pro or even heavy amateur gamer; I relax and play WoW, SWTOR, and the Fable series. With a side of Age of Empires to relax. No Guild dungeons. No battlegrounds I even do a MUD that I have been on for 20 years or so.When I first downloaded these 4 games, I was ecstatic. So Smooth, so responsive, such lovely graphics.For 2 months.After only 2 months the hard drive crashed, No hope for it.Refund.Won't buy another Acer Nitro series. Too much of a pain in the neck to return a machine during a pandemic.Good luck if you purchase one.",0
"Fans are not as quiet as I thought, but overall a great laptop.",0
"I had the exact same wi-fi network issues as everyone else has mentioned. I bought this for graduate school and online classes - I need a more dependable wifi computer than this one. The Troubleshooting recommended attaching an ethernet chord, but there is no ethernet port to connect to on the laptop. I tried resetting my modem and restarting the computer multiple times, to no avail. The laptop isn't recognizing ANY network - phone hotpsot or internet modem. I tried registering it on HP and the product number cannot be found, so I was SOL on HP tech support too. I'm processing a return today.",0
Love this. Works great for me.,0
"I use this laptop as a platform that runs to a hub. The hub operates two monitors, two printers, a backup external drive and a host of other items. It's fast and efficient. Plus if I want to unplug to take it with me, it is so portable. Cool.",0
I got this for $500 and it's really great! Fast and does everything I need for work. I love that the screen is so big,0
"Excellent quality, great screen, touch sensitivity and the included pen works smoothly.",0
"I own the UX330 (7th gen), and I love the battery life. I dual boot Ubuntu and run that as my main OS, and I routinely get 12 hours on it. I would highly recommend it for anyone that doesn't need a dedicated graphics card (photo/video editing, gaming) as the battery life is phenomenal.I try to charge it at around 40% and not past 80% to preserve battery life, so I only get about 5-6 hours SOT, but I'm only using 40% of the battery at a time. It charges quickly, 30 minutes or less to get that 40%, and I almost never turn it off, I just let it sleep. I can let it sleep for a couple days and if it drops 1% in that time I'm surprised.The screen angle is a bit annoying, I wish it would go back a bit further (15 degrees more would be great), but its light and it feels durable (not as nice as a macbook, but its half the price).I have had issues sometimes with the trackpad not responding properly, but I believe thats due to Ubuntu. It works wonderfully in Windows, I never have any issues typing in Windows and my hand usually rests on the trackpad, which caused problems with my previous laptop.The USB C is amazing for me, as my phone is USB C, it really makes life easy. Not as big of a plus if you don't have other usb c devices. The mini HDMI is annoying, I still haven't purchased any miniHDMI to HDMI cables.The speakers are in a terrible spot, underneath the laptop, and they're pretty underpowered. Again, in my mind, that would fall under a media machine, which this is not, so its not a deal breaker for me.My girlfriend purchased the 8th gen. It has a slightly more powerful processer, but less battery life. It still lasts a very long time, and she has no complaints.All in all, I love my laptop. Its unbelievably light, and the battery is awesome, and its more than quick enough for anything I use it for, as I don't do anything graphically intensive.",0
"I purchased this laptop from Treasure Truck. It was at a wonderful price. Typically, when I choose to purchase electronics from Amazon I am offered an extended warranty. I was not offered a warranty for this machine so I looked up the item at the regular price and the extended warranty option was listed. I called Amazon to setup and purchase the guarantee, but was told to contact the manufacturer. I contacted HP several times (could not connect to a human) so I entered the serial number as instructed, but the HP system indicated it had no record of the machine’s serial number. This transaction seemed suspicious to me so I returned the item.",0
Great product for gaming laptop under 2.000usd (June 2022) 9/10What can be improved is the laptop display and the ports phisical layout.,0
Easy to use. Battery lasts long.,0
We thought it had a touchscreen but it didn’t. Glad it has lit keyboard. We got the silver color. The white letters on the keys are hard to see. Otherwise no complaints. It was a good price.,0
"We've had this chromebook for less than a year and it has major mechanical issues. The screen will only display an image when it is tilted to just the right angle, if it is bumped or moved in the slightest way the screen will go blank. This is very frustrating and started happening less than six months after purchase. There are also problems with audio input for head phones where every once in a while there will be no audio and you have to reset the device in order to get any audio back on.",0
the port on the right works like USB 2.0 in speed.,0
Good product large screen and very light. Very quick operation,0
Its a really good laptop. Worth the price,0
"Bought this rig in May 2021, worked great until September 2021 then died. Lenovo service people in Taipei offered endless apologies but still charged me to look at it. Motherboard was fried. Did some research it is a common problem with this model.Got ripped off, and feel cheated.Anyone considering this POS should consider other options. Lenovo is dragging the legacy of IBM through the mud. Avoid Avoid Avoid.",0
Got the i9 3070ti version for 1.2k. Decent specs for the price. Thermal is much improved comparing to G15. Able to run 2k game at highest setting smoothly. 16:10 monitor is also good for productivity task. Only downside is one ssd slot but can't ask for more at this price point.,0
Most navigational keys are placed in strange places.,0

"I've purchased this quite some time ago, and all I can say is its the best laptop I've ever had! the speed and multitasking is crazy!",0
"This item didn't include the HDD memory as described in the amazon web page. It only included the SDD memory, the rest of the details and information are FAKE!",0
"I have had no issues whatsoever with this laptop. It is super thin, and feels a lot lighter than it is. It is super fast.",0
It has overheating issues even when games aren't on ultra settings.,0
"After less than three (3) months, the screen went black although the power light is on.I’ve tried troubleshooting but cannot seem to find resolve. Guess I’ll have to purchase a new one as I know it won’t be replaced because I didn’t purchase the warranty.",0
"love this laptop and it screen quality is great. clear, easy to type on the keyboard. easy use of an extended usb mouse. i don't like the touchpad personally preferred the usb mouse. screen is 25 inch so you can make the font larger and it doesn't take away from the view.",0
Screen flickers when not plugged in. Otherwise great,0
"Just for example, right now I'm trying to search for recipes by googling what I'd like. Each link I click on of course has many videos and ads which is an annoying thing about the internet these days regardless. But on this machine, it is unmanageable. It takes so long for the sites to load and then you can't scroll easily, keeps getting hung up. So I must do stuff like this on my phone instead. It's useless for even this simple function.For another thing. I'm trying to stream a movie. If you rewind or pause or do anything like that, it freezes, buffers forever. Even if you leave it alone and just let it play, it skips every few minutes.One last thing. My email is with yahoo. I know it's an old provider, but I don't want to change it- I've had it for years. The OS makes it extremely difficult to view my email or scroll through my messages. It has prompted me to download it into Drive and open it up that way, but if I wanted to use google for my email I'd do that. It annoys me that I must merge my yahoo mail with google rather than just being able to see it as if on any other computer I've ever used in my life.I have not tried to use it for anything else as it's brand new, but this should give you some idea of what a total piece of garbage this machine is, you can't even use it for extremely basic internet browsing. I wish I'd spent the money on something else. It is a total waste of money.-Carla",0
"It meets my expectations. I only have one, minor, gripe. I can't figure out how to do a right-click on the touch pad. To compensate for this, I got a mouse to use with the computer.",0
"My last chromebook from another company had the same issue. This one is brand new straight out of the box. The charging plug has to be pushed in a certain way or it will not charge. It is a very loose connection and I suspect it will not make it long before it breaks and I have to start propping up against a wall just so it will charge. This is a very frustraiting design flaw with many of these inexpensive laptops. Other than that, it is a very basic laptop and serves my needs.UPDATE: The screen is starting to blackout/smudge in the bottom and top corners. I wasn't expecting a great computer for this price but this is pathetic. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.",0
"Will update as I learn more about the computerUPDATE 1: I have had this computer now for only two days, overall it's been a fairly nice two days. Didn't go as smoothly as I was starting it up for the first time. When I was setting my new password for some reason the ""5"" key on the numpad was not working, however it is miraculously working now. Also after noticing there was an update, I updated the laptop and when it was booting back up, after the log on screen it was just a black screen that wouldn't go away. I shut it off two times with no progress. However, after shutting off the laptop for the third time I decided to remove the Mouse usb, when I turned it back on it went back to normal and started as if nothing happened. It hasn't happened again. So that was a bit of a setback. Besides that, I've been having a smooth experience with the laptop. It's pretty fast. I will test the gaming aspect some time soon.UPDATE 2: I've had the laptop for a few months now, it's working very smoothly, it's fast when starting up, and I've had no major issues. I haven't tried playing any newer 'heavy' games but the witcher 2, LA NOIRE, murdered soul suspect, maple story, and skyrim run extremely well on it. I also use a drawing tablet on the laptop and I haven't had any issues with that either. It runs good. I just started the new college semester so I'm going to be using the laptop more frequently and I'll be using programs like Visual Studio and Autopsy so I'll update again soon!",0
Fast!,0
"Happy with it ,..no down sides",0
HP laptop was slightly used from the Amazon Warehouse. Laptop looks new! No scratches or marks.Runs smoothly after three months. I saved hundreds by buying from the Warehouse!,0

"I love everything about my Cromebook, I'm very pleased.",0
"This laptop is a mess. First, it's filled with promotional software and it's nigh impossible to get rid of it. Pop-up notifications all the time to buy the programs. Then, it makes you (aggressively forces you) use IE and BING!! Bing is--surprise--still abysmal and full of advertised results. Microsoft itself apparently engineered this. You can't use Google without downloading a separate workaround! Finally, it runs slower than any computer I can remember in the past decade. It's worthless for the only thing I need it for: Quickbooks Accounting. Now, I've used Quickbooks for decades, and never had a problem with speed. On this machine, it's beyond frustrating. It takes minutes just to boot, then minutes to load, etc., etc., OH! The touchpad is a total loss -- it works only on certain spots. Need to use a mouse instead.",0

Already the laptop has gotten the ""no bootable drive"" error message. The laptop is of course out of warranty now and the only fix is seemingly to replace the M2 SSD which are not cheap. You get what you pay for. I will never purchase another Acer product again.",0

Bought it because I need a tablet for travel purposes,0

"For the price and the specs, you would expect LG to properly check that all of the components work as expected. Well I can tell you from first hand experience that it seems like they don't. The laptop is light, and when the battery has charge, it does work as expected, but unfortunately the battery does not keep a charge, and after the battery ran out, that was it for the laptop. Shame on LG for not doing their work right. I guess I won't be buying LG ever again.",0
i realized this 2 hours into setuponce i unplugged the laptop diedabsolutely horrible,0
"I would advise u not to buy this laptop! I purchased mine in May, 31st, 2019 and I can count on one hand how many times I've used it and it just shut off on December 10th, 2019. Called about it and they say they can't refund me but offered to fix. This doesn't make sense!🤬🤬🤬 How can one be selling a product that stops working in couple months! Your money just goes down the drain like that and I've also been told that these brands aren't even good. So what the hell should I do now! I need back my money so I can purchase a better product!

"The Lenovo Flex 6 with 14 inches HD LCD IPS panel with touch screen reviewed here has impressive features that really works well. The best part is the affordability in this crowded convertible PC market. It can also function as “Tablet PC” thanks to its 360 degrees swivel design and with the optional pen; you can get creative with included software. Even without a pen, the touch screen registers simple & multi-touch gestures really well. Once you get accustomed using touch screen, you will see that using this PC becomes very intuitive.In this price range, the Lenovo Flex 6 offers a very well balanced mix of features, which you can find only on premium priced laptops, which I find a major benefit in this new 2018 model. The laptop’s LCD panel is good with high-resolution full HD display and the Yoga-like design makes it possible to use it as a tablet as well as in a tent type for viewing multimedia. The speakers are excellent for a laptop of this size and are ‘Harman Kardon’ branded boasting Dolby Audio premium sound.The display’s bezel (only on three sides) is actually quite thin for a laptop that is quite affordable. Actually looks high-end. Granted there is about 1 inch or thicker bezel at the bottom of the display but I found this larger than normal bottom bezel useful as this prevents your fingers coming in view while you type. The camera is on the top and has a white light to indicate its ON. Lenovo has apps that allow you to disable camera from the taskbar. You could also cover it using a thin black electrical tape! Webcam camera is 720p, which works great with Microsoft Skype.The keyboard has adjustable brightness enabled back-lighting and provides comfortable scalloped type of keys that you tend to find only on high-end laptops. The keyboard also has a row of multimedia keys and provides easy access to volume, display, and host of other functions with minimal effort. The touch-pad is actually very responsive and features multiple gestures compatible with Windows 10. Scrolling effortlessly using two fingers, minimizing to desktop using 3-finger grab all works great.The laptop also has a fingerprint sensor, which is Windows 10 “Hello” capable, which I found very useful. The quality of the laptop is better than expected for the offered price range, it does not feel like cheap plastic and the brushed metal look gives the laptop a high-class look. This is of course little heavy but relatively thin laptop. It weighs in at 3.5 pounds and about 18mm thick.The laptop is very snappy, all the included applications worked right out of the box; there was no hanging, lagging and there were no crashes. The review sample given to me had Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz, with 16GB of DDR4 RAM (SK Hynix HMA82GS6CJR8N-VK); The SSD had a capacity of 256GB, which is a M.2 type model number HFS256GD9TNG-62A0A (SK Hynix.) Granted, it is not the best M.2 “PCIe SSD” currently in the market but in my tests, I found out that the Windows 10 OS boots in under 15 seconds, which I consider plenty, fast enough for a laptop of this price range.The motherboard had a built-in Intel HD VGA (620), which drives the LCD panel, also a GeForce MX130 discrete sitting on PCI Express x4 Gen3 bus, dedicated video memory 2048 MB of GDDR5 type: Realtek 8822BE Wireless LAN 802.11ac PCI-E NIC. Wi-Fi Wireless. You also have Bluetooth 4.1 for file transfers and audio device pairing. The laptop has 'secure boot' enabled, also has a TPM module, which gives Windows 10 the cryptographic operations. This also means it is harder to tamper using malicious software, which is good for you as a customer & the hardware manufacturer (Lenovo) & software provider (Microsoft).PROS:[+] Good build quality, feels sturdy, does not look cheap! Touchpad works great![+] LCD panel is good quality, FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS multi-touch anti-glare and good viewing angles.[+] Battery life is better than average, works for about eight hrs. Also has fast charging options![+] Boots fast under 15 seconds, wakes up fast too. Has fingerprint sensor with Hello compatible![+] All included applications worked right out of the box, No hangs or crashes![+] Tablet PC mode is a plus. You can do creative things using the optional pen.[+] You can double your laptop as a gaming device using XBOX app from Microsoft[+] Has USB-C port, Always ON USB 3.0 port for charging your phone. Has HDMI port, SD card slot.[+] Has a standard 3.5mm audio combo jack perfect for wired headphones & gaming headsetsCONS:[-] Little bit heavy at 3.5 pounds[-] The discrete graphics GeForce MX130 is not compatible with Microsoft mixed Reality (VR)Even with the very few minor CONs listed above, which I have discovered thus far, the laptop is very capable looks good and feels good in hand, It is otherwise fully functional thereby not affecting my overall impression. I however caution you that you need to get the “top-most” model ""81EM000DUS"" or better offered here. Please note that Lenovo makes laptops that are affordable for the masses but please do not get too stingy trying to save additional $200 on the low-end model in the Flex-6 series, please make yourself a favor and get the",0

"I've been a PC user forever and decided to give Chromebook a try. It's easy to set up, and I love the ease of sharing documents, but that's it. My Chromebook disconnects from my wireless printer at least once a month, and takes hours to reconnect; it's very non-intuitive when I'm trying to pull documents from my external drive; I (and this is my fault, but still a consideration) can't seem to master the differences between ""my drive"" and ""cloud storage"", so finding documents is always a challenge. And I find it nearly impossible to organize my many documents in an intuitive, usable way that I always could with any PC. Bottom line, I've been using the Microsoft O/S since they started and the Google O/S is just too many new tricks for this old dog. I'm buying a new PC today and tossing my Chromebook in the trash where it belongs.",0

This time with the laptop not detecting it's own camera, and the USB ports just stopped working after only having this laptop for 3 months.

"I *LOVE* IT!!I have been using Samsung Chromebooks for 5 years, my 2012 Chromebook was finally hard to charge, but it might have had something to do with having been dropped several times, and still running great, but hard to charge. I put a little paper tape around the charging pin and it charges now.. but felt its days were numbered so got this new Chromebook!*LOVE* the feel and look of it, no complaints at all, Samsung Chromebooks are amazing! I do prefer the 11.6"" to the narrower Samsung Plus or Pro, they have great resolution, but this Samsung Chromebook I just bought was only $169, sold by Amazon, which always means a lot to me. Third party sellers can't be trusted in my 17 years experience as a regular Amazon customer. Go *Prime* whenever you can, and Sold by Amazon, whenever you can! Makes a huge difference in the customer service you'll get, and Amazon's is outstanding!This particular model was just released this in Feb 2017, I ordered another Samsung Chromebook 3 and returned it the same day about a year ago. This is completely different, feels solid, looks great, operates like a great Samsung Chromebook should, and for $169, you just can't go wrong.Highly recommended! (For your basic things.. Chromebooks do not have a CD/DVD drive or some other features of higher end laptops, but I *LOVE them!)",0

"I very specifically looked up the operating system for this device and in each category this page said it operated within “windows 10”. Turns out it runs on WINDOWS 10 S MODE. That means you cannot download anything not from the Microsoft store and I mean ANYTHING AT ALL. You can’t download chrome, or in my instance the entire reason I bought this laptop, for my online teaching applications. Now granted, you can switch out of S mode, but the fast speeds advertised using this system which is very misleading.",0

My brother loved gaming with his New laptop,0
"So this review is EXTREMELY unfortunate to give ! I buy LOTS of products off amazon and over the years this is probably my 2nd review I’ve ever actually written . And I only do it because I feel obligated to warn people until ASUS pulls this product or gives a free extended warranty with it to ALL customers ! I love the look of this laptop and the build quality is great as far as materials used for screen and case , and I really love the look of it . It’s way nicer looking in person too ! I read a lot of bad reviews and took a gamble . I lost . This laptop is nothing but manufacturing defects in motherboard and software. Fans ran full blast 6700rpm right out the box , light keys didn’t work right either . And trust me I tried everything . Mine came down to a bad motherboard . I’m getting full refund so I’m at no loss , it’s just disappointing because I really loved the style of this laptop and wanted it to work out . Digging much much deeper into the issues , I have read COUNTLESS reviews of people having the same issues and worse . Seams to be mostly with these new models of ROG laptops . Clearly something went horribly wrong during manufacturing and they won’t admit it . Funny thing is , I read a review that was several months old saying “ ASUS told him they haven’t had any other complaints of this issue and they are surprised to hear about it “ and I was told the same thing by ASUS as well when I 1st called for help trying to fix the issues . I told him that’s funny because I am now reading reviews after reviews on line of people having the SAME problems . With no fix . Everyone being put through a long process of installing this and that and updating this and that , resetting the computer and doing it all again . Just to come to the same conclusion that the motherboard is bad and if I send it in they will change it out and send it back . Unfortunately I didn’t pay this much for a refurbished unit . I don’t want to bash ASUS as a whole , but it’s definitely not ok with this new ROG line in 2019 . I can’t speak for the scar 3 but personally , after this , I will not gamble on that now especially when I’d have to fork out another $500 or so for the 3 . One good thing I can say though all of this , is amazon is great at handling it and refunding everything or doing whatever I want to do to resolve it . A big reason I only buy PRIME products . It’s very rare I ever have a issue buying from amazon , but when I do they take care of me . I don’t mess around and wait to deal with the issue . Some people do and want to use the products for awhile defected and then try returning last minute and get a hassle sometimes because it’s then warn in some cases . Anyways , DONT BUY THIS ASUS PRODUCT . I’d advise to wait another year for them to work this issue out ! Good luck with your purchase decisions ! I’m probably going to go for the hp omen 15 as it was my 2nd option . All the hp split talk is a little nerve racking but I think it will all work out in the end .",0
Very bright screen.I like the keys being a little wider apart than other brands of laptops.The processor is very fast.I think the built in speakers are not good but I have good quality outside speakers and earbuds so it's not a big problem.,0
IF you are looking for a chromebook just do to the Normal such as youtube search schooling then this is Perfect. IF you want to play games in play store a touch Screen would be much better. The touch screen was outta my budget for now. Just dont like that I cant play games. Other than that I Love it!,0
Using for past six months. It take less time to start and power backup is good. It’s convenient for regular usage.,0
It is a little on the heavy side for carrying around,0
I had been searching for a little computer that I could pop in my purse from home to work since my husband and I own our own business. It's super lightweight and the keyboard doesn't feel too small. Even my husband is jealous now. I have zero complaints.,0

"Runs games like Deep Rock Galactic, Metro Exodus and GTA V on max settings with ease. Only problem I had with this laptop though is the MaxAudio Driver that comes with the laptop and a few of the audio settings. I found a fix for this, but whenever I went into YouTube and started playing a video, the audio driver would turn on my web camera which isn't really necessary and a bit weird. I fixed this by ticking the option to not allow any external apps to use my webcam. I also had to find out how to disable ""enhanced audio"" that came default with it because it sounds horrible. It was pretty frustrating having to look all of this up as I hadn't had any of these problems in the past with new laptops. Other than that though this laptop is great.",0

It is suppose to update in stable channel but google says there is an issue and doesn't give a date as to when it will be fixed. If I go to beta channel some stuff is very buggy.

"We purchased this for my daughter so she could write. It works perfectly fine. However, It does feel like cheap plastic. And the mouse you have to hit hard for it to realize you are trying to double click on it. That being said, you can't beat the price.",0
El computador funciona perfectamente. Cumple con el trabajo de uso diario. La bareria no tiene mucha duración con tareas normales. Dura alrededor de 3 horas.Si pones un SSD M.2 no puedes poner un HDD. Porque el espacio queda ocupado por el M.2El dise?o es bonito.,0
"After 5 months the laptop keyboard lights up, but no screen or boot attempt. Just hear fans cycling and the keyboard is just red. Id expect a laptop like this to last a few years before having problems. Never moved from my desk since opening it. Vastly disappointed.Update: Spoke to the customer support and they walked me through a driver reset and it resolved my issue. I was surprised how easy of a fix it was. Thank goodness no need to ship it in or go to a repair shop.",0
"Starts very fast, good price.",0
Use this for gaming and absolutely love it works great for all the games I've played so far including new world,0
"This thing straight up sucks. It's slap full of bloatware and you can't uninstall half of it. It doesn't have the power to run any kind of browser other than Microsoft Edge, and that browser isn't exactly uhhhh useful. It legit can't handle more than one tab at a time, and even then it takes forever. It is 100% not my internet, either. Even tried a wired connection and still got the same. It's just a crappy piece of hardware, so I guess it is true that you get what you pay for.At least it's lightweight and basically never dies.",0
I noticed a bit of coil whine,0
"the computer is very amazing, the colors are bright and it is well built.",0
What a horrible product. Got the laptop and would not even turn on all the way. Screen would blink and laptop would shut down.,0
"I bought this lap top early last year. It had all of the specs I wanted and although it lacked reviews at the time, I had seen reviews for similar HP laptops and decided to risk it. I think that was overall a good decision.The laptop is very fast with booting and loading. I use it mostly for browsing and streaming, which is great. For the past 4 months, I have started to use it for online gaming, League of Legends. This computer is not a gaming lap top, and so I have to operate the game on the lightest settings possible, and have little else running in the background in order to play. It still functions well for my purposes. I don't have internet connectivity issues causes by the laptop. The only problem is how hot it gets when I play games and sometimes when windows uses lots of processing power in the background. The fan gets loud at those times.Overall, I am happy with this computer, it is light weight and portable, so easy to carry to work. It's thinness doesn't seem to make it that fragile. I bang my bag around sometimes without noticing and occasionally spill things on or near the mouse pad, but it has survived my clumsiness. I have found that any computer problems I have had this past year were caused by software and reparable with research. I was worried about overloading the laptop and damaging the hardware when I started gaming, but it hasn't slowed down at all when I use it for work and streaming.",0

"Solo lo recomiendo si esta por debajo de los 35K ya que aunque es un buen equipo se calienta con facilidad y va reduciendo su rendimiento. Por otra parte el embalaje de Amazon fue muy malo ya que la computadora estaba casi suelta.

I never owned a Mac before and I am very pleased with this purchase. I was nervous about ordering it off Amazon at first but it was slightly cheaper and came in exactly two days. No issues with damages or overall quality. Screen quality/graphics are great. I am able to play most of the computer games I wanted to on here with no overheating issues. Battery lasts a while depending on what I am doing and charges very quickly.,0

"Good computer, super fast and great buying",0
"I bought this in lieu of building a gaming pc . This laptop performed well with the current games I play without too many issues. When you first get the laptop you have to go into the Graphic card's setting to allow it to use the GEforce graphics card on your games/applications otherwise it uses the ""main"" GPU which is....bad. It does run hot when playing at higher settings ~80C and the battery life is subpar to put it lightly. Overall decent for the price.",0
"It's really thin, and without the compromise of no LAN or no camera.",0
Nice product arrived on time,0
GOD,0
"I love this computer. It is fast, the battery life is excellent and fast delivery!",0
"Bought this to work on a huge ancestry project because I needed something faster than my old laptop or phone or tablet. It is SUPER Fast, but you can't use a lot of apps that you may be used to. The streaming quality for music and videos is abysmal. If you need something larger than your tablet and just use it for internet reference, it'll work, but if you want more, spend the extra $50 and get an economical laptop from Walmart or anywhere. I would have returned it, but not worth the hassle. Still need to run 3 separate devices while working on projects.",0
"I like the storage, and the screen quality.I do not like the face that it still is not a ""lap"" top so to speak. A laptop had a cd/dvd in it... this does not.... a laptop is compatible with games that have been purchased and downloaded... this Acer is not. So if you have down loads some will not be compatible and you might want to rethink.... other than that.... it is pretty decent.",0
Out of the box it was wasn’t working well. After a day I was able to set it up and got it running but it ran slow and the screen froze multiple times. The next day when I was turning it on it said that auto repair had failed and the drive had to be wiped clean. I got it when it was on sale and I like the model but now I’m going to have to pay more money for the same product. I love having a 1000 dollar paper weight.,0
"Bought the same laptop for my son last year. This year, bought the same model of the current year for my daughter.Similar to an Apple laptop for less than half the price.",0
"Best laptop you can buy but mine came scratched idk why Apple is trying to punish me for but it's fine. Also be really careful because the screen is special, it has a coating for retina display and even touching it or gently cleaning it can remove some of the coating and leave subtle blue marks. Sound is boxy I'd recommend SpeakerAmp and choose flat sound to get a clearer sound. But nothing is perfect of course and for that price this is a great investment",0
The battery is NOT replaceable,0
"bastante buena, la duración de la batería no ha sido conforme a mis expectativas. En la oferta indicaba que la duración de la batería era de 8hrs de uso, no llega al 50%...",0
"Great little laptop but it gets overheated easily and then starts to run into bugs when it does which is annoying when you are trying to make a presentation or when working on Adobe premiere. It can make the program stop working or you can lose your content all together. If they could figure out how to keep it cool enough, I'd say it is an awesome little laptop. Battery life is short when running programs but if just surfing the web, it'll last long. Screen quality is amazing though.",0
"Although this laptop gets great reviews, and is an Amazon recommendation...I bought 2 and both failed, and by that I mean totally bricked, (no screen and no combination of keystrokes will recover this condition). The first failed after about two weeks, I figured it was a fluke and returned it for a replacement. The second one failed with in 24 hours, exact same failure, Curiously the first was preloaded with Windows 11, the replacement came with Windows 10 and required an update. I don't know if Amazon has a warehouse of defective units, but this is unacceptable. BTW, I spent 40+ years in IT I realize the low cost of this unit probably means some cheap components, but really? So unless you enjoy standing in line at UPS for returns...avoid this POS",0
"MSI managed to squeeze a powerful desktop into a 5lb, slim laptop form factor",0
"My previous computer setup consisted of a MSI gaming computer and a Surface Pro computer for on the go. I enjoyed owning both machines, but often fantasized if I could somehow merge the 2 machines and get the best of both worlds. I loved my MSI gaming laptop, but it was quite large/thick and heavy. I loved the Surface Pro, but didn't quite handle gaming well [unless you are using game pass or streaming games]. Then out of the blue comes this computer, which seemed like a Surface on steroids. I was delighted to check this machine out and decided to make this my own PC for gaming and on the go.The computer arrived well packed and well accessorized [as one would hope for an expensive piece of tech]. The Z13 came bundled with the XG Mobile RTX 3080 dock, a case for Z13, a case for XG Mobile dock, AC chargers for both Z13 and XG Mobile Dock and writing stylus. It has a nice metal feel and sturdiness to it that felt premium. If you are familiar with ROG products, had that familiar ROG aesthetic all over it. I certainly enjoyed the RGB window in the back showing off some of the main board.The computer is fast and snappy. I had hoped for a 32 GB of RAM version, but at the moment is was only available in 16 GB of RAM. Windows 11 Pro set up pretty quickly and was not too horrible of a jump coming from Windows 10 [though I like Win 10 a bit more]. The screen was nice and bright for a tablet computer and touch was responsive. The Z13 tablet computer is not a bad machine on its own. It's not unitl you involve the XG Mobile RTX 3080 dock that things started falling apart for me and apparantly for other users. This dock gives you Z13 that bump in performance and graphics, but it comes with lots of headaches too.For instance, you are supposed to be able to charge the Z13 when it's connected to the dock. This feature is super handy, that is, if it continues to work for you. After exactly 30 days, the XG Mobile dock stopped charging the Z13. It would not work no matter what I tried. I updated the firmware through ASUS's terrible Armory software and still yielded the same results. I reached out ASUS suppport and they could not even really help me and suggested I send the PC back for inspection and repairs. This was a defeating moment for me, I hadn't owned this machine for 30 days and already I am having to send in my dock and computer in for repairs. The process over the phone was brutal. The wait times were astronomical and I couldn't make use of their chat option since it was being updated at the time of seeking support. It took ASUS about 3 weeks to get it back to me. This was nuts, but the long wait time was attributed to parts shortage. I had to borrow my wife's PC while I waited. Fast forward, I get my computer back and the XG dock once again is able to charge my Flow Z13 computer again. However, this did not last long as after a week it stopped charging the computer again! I wish that I had tested this PC a lot sooner, maybe I would have been able to return it. I had ordered thsi computer whilst on holiday and did not have much time to test it within a return window sadly. I did find an incovenient workaround to the charging problem. Here's what you do: plug in the included 100W AC charger first after completely shutting the computer. Boot up the computer plugged into it's original AC charger and let Windows load up completely. Next, plug in your XG mobile dock and let the system do its connection. I know what you are thinking. You are like, well that defeats the charging from dock option, you are right and also takes up a USB C thunderbolt port too. However, this is only way I have gotten the system to remain charging and have the XG mobile dock working. I refused to send this machine again to ASUS.Let's get into the Armory software on ASUS ROG computers. First off, this software is buggy and glitchy as perhaps Windows Me [lol]]. It's supposed to help you manage the thermals on your machine and other bits of data including updates to drivers and firmwares. After about 2 months in, the Armory software refused to update anything. There would be critical updates for the system itself and the updates would time out and fail. After reviewing many forums and reddits, it appeared I had no choice but to remove the armory software and re-install it. ASUS has an Armory removing software and the Armory software right on their site. It was simple enough to remove, but a nightmare to re-install. I kept getting an error message stating that my internet connection failed during the install. I got the Offline installer for Armory, hoping this would solve the error [because my Internet was fine] and it still errored out. This software controls so many aspects of ROG computers. ASUS has made it this way to be supposedly convenient, but I wished they had made sure their software worked. I still could not install Armory. I had to reach out to ASUS via Support Chat. After barely 2 minutes of troubleshooting, the rep calmy types: Well sir, you are going to need to do a master reset. A whole reset to the system again! The system was completely reset once from coming back from 'repairs' and now that I'd finally got my machine back to the way I like it, I have to bloody reset the darn machine again! With little choice, I master reset the system. The Armory software appears to be cleaned installed due to the reset and it's at least functional again. It just blows my mind that a company this big does not have this software working like a charm. After the reset, Armory appears to be working, but I hold my breath each time there is an update. Will the update work or require me again to reset my computer? I honestly think these things now.I also, on some occasions, have trouble getting my monitor to come on while plugged into the XG Mobile dock. I have a nice Zowie BenQ 240hz monitor hooked into Display port, but sometimes the monitor will not display properly. There is nothing wrong with the monitor. I have to either unplug the monitor from dock or unplug it's power source to get it working again.I apologize for the long review, but in conclusion, I can not recommend this computer to anyone. At this price range, you could get a great computer from other brands with ease (and maybe even save some money in the process).",0

"I was swayed with the bigger screen and the HDMI port; but have found it to be noticeably slower than previous HP Chromebook purchases. I had 3 HPs but wanted to try something different. If this was my very first one, I would be impressed; but I also see that the resolution is wanting compared to my old one, which is still on the floor in front of me; but it kept losing the cursor and I finally bought this one.",0

I'm really impressed with this laptop. When reading the reviews I was a little worried about it but I knew it wouldn't be like a regular windows based laptop. I wanted something smaller that I can travel with. It has completely met my expectations for what I wanted.,0
Bought this at request for my grandson for his graduation. He is extremely involved with gaming and was pumped to say the least when he received it. He was also appreciating everything else it could do for him relevant to his continuing education. It was a Win Win!,0
"Computer works well and seems a good value. Enjoy Windows 11. Had one glitch when it dropped internet and struggled to get reconnected. Thought we might have either software or hardware issue. Did finally get it back, but normally it would be an easy reconnect just by finding a viable WiFi signal. Not the case. If it occurs again, we’ll deal with HP to see if we have a hardware issue; reason for a 4-star rating. Otherwise, it was easy to set up and connect with printer and monitor. And, it’s really lightweight so easy to travel with in my backpack.",0

"When it comes to the world of laptops and choosing the one right for you, the MacBook Air has always been a good choice. As with this one, it’s a GREAT one. After a few months of using this is the best laptop on the market you can buy while spending a reasonable price. While it’s definitely a big buck to spend, I think I got my moneys worth. It’s fast, reliable, and what you should expect if not more. It’s more than capable of my everyday needs and tasks. Display is nice as well as the overall quality and build as expected.

Works well under Linux. Only issue noticed is the touchpad doesn't work out of the box.

The multi monitor support works super well.,0
Overheated. Not 2022 model...2019. Returned. Still waiting on refund. Definite NO.Do your research.,0
I love the screen. The lightness and thinness of the is astonishing.,0
I love MAC laptops. They are reliable and this one has the newest processor which is very fast and the screen has no frame. The only issue that this causes is a lot of finger smudges from opening it or adjusting the screen.,0

"This was my second Acer. The first one self-destructed after the screen encasement decided to come apart after two years of use. It served me well and was damn fast. I used it mostly for Photoshop. The Acer Aspire 5 is totally unusable for Photoshop and I had to return it. The Acer Aspire 5 is perfect for everyday computer use (surfing the web, email, watching videos). It is not meant for more advanced uses. Photoshop crashed and the laptop became unstable while I used it. A computer guy recommended Asus to me and that is what I'm using now.",0

"I'm very please with fast shipment. Took only two days to deliver to Serbia. Laptop is very light for 15 inch. Fans don't spin up during regular work so it's silent. I guess that's because this is larger model. Everything works as intended. I understand now why some people say the screen is blurry. Its actually very clear and vivid when watching movies and youtube. But, sometimes the text content could be presented in sharpness a little bit under expectations. Not sure if this is Samsungs or windows resizing thing or the combination of the two but it's not that prominent. Could be better though. Sound is decent once you turn on Dolby. Another thing is that the panel is super slim and feels fragile so yiu should be careful with it. Although it does wobble a little bit once you open it, it does not while you re typing on the keyboard. Track pad is better than lenovos, but key travel is lower and some keys sound clicky more than the others. Also not a big issue. It's really good laptop. It looks very nice in white.",0
I purchased this laptop a few months ago and so far so good. I love it! I have to get used to the Microsoft part of it but all in all it's been a great laptop for a great price.,0
"Pretty great office/productivity PC, be aware of sales because I got it for a great price and then it went up. I would highly recommend getting the base storage version and upgrading the SSD if you have the technical ability, you can save hundreds that way.Overall great ventilation, build quality, weight, battery.Cons:Definitely the screen was a let down, the viewing angles are terrible you pretty much need to directly look at it. But if that’s the only sacrifice they made to get to this price point, I think it’s worth it.",0

Well, I am not disappointed!!!!!! This bad boy started up and I didn't have to wait for it to actually get ready to use, I have been doing that for a year!!!! The keyboard is fantastic and I love the colors!!! The thickness is a bit getting used to but I find that my wrist isn't hurting like they were, so that's a plus. The only thing that I am having issues with is that I run my mouse into the charging cord every so often, but that is easily the smallest thing that I have found wrong!!! Wish I had taken the leap sooner!!!",0
"I had a heck of a time when using this because of the wifi dropping out or not initializing. I believe that the ""bloatware"" was interfering with it. I say this because I updated windows several times to no avail. It does work fine now. The swiching of the wifi driver to disable letting windows decide when to optimize battery usage DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. The battery does charge quickly but it does not last super long (may explain in part the quick charging). I am now completely satisfied.",0
"At first I was really happy to get a “nice” laptop that I could play games and do work on it. But I want to let other people know that it’s not that could consider getting something else.1. First problem i encountered was randomly it didn’t want to charge maybe I assumed it was bc it was too hot so i gave it time to cool down then it still didn’t want to charge luckily there was a video I had found.2. it’s very uncomfortable to lay down and play or even watch it will leave an imprint or even be way too hot to put onto legs, I used to pillow or blanket because it was that hot.3. now all of a sudden my laptop screen is frozen for whatever reason4. The battery life is Not good at all! 7 hours is not true maybe 3 hours of playing games but not 7. Maybe if I were just watching movies and looking up stuff but if this is what it’s supposed to be a Gaming Laptop then it’s not 7 and the only game I play is the Sims .But the only thing I like that is why I’m giving the stars I am is the screen quality it is very good I play Sims in high resolution.",0
I disliked everything about this product. It gave me problems from the minute I turned it on.,0

"The UX550VE is a very disappointing entry to the Zenbook lineup in my opinion. Seriously, do not buy this laptop! Let me explain:I am an IT professional and long-time Asus customer, both for laptops and motherboards. I have used a Zenbook UX31A as my primary ultrabook for about six years since I bought it at its release. It has been an exceptional machine - even in its old age (just had to replace the charging port, but now it's my Linux portable). Looking back, I am surprised to have used the same laptop for so long, and that should speak to how well built of a machine it is. So of course when I needed a new laptop, I quickly decided on another Zenbook.When I was shopping for laptops, I really *really* wanted the UX550VD. I contacted Asus many times when it would be released in the US, but of course they could never tell me. Eventually the old Zenbook went out of commission for a while, so I had to upgrade and settled on the UX550VE. Don't get me wrong, the specs on this machine at nothing to sneeze at and there are some good aspects to it. However, the flaws are so glaring that they ruin the entire user experience and so those are all I will be discussing here.First of all, the charging port on my particular unit super shoddy. Really janky af. It's not lined up with the case, so I feel like I am going to break it every time I insert the charger. It does work, but this should not have passed QC. See attached photo. The rest of the physical build is just okay; this is still a pretty big and fairly hefty machine - nothing to write home about.Second, the fingerprint scanner is pretty nice to have, but why in the world is it ON THE TOUCHPAD!? Asus, I'd actually really like an answer to this question. Having the fingerprint reader on the touchpad renders the entire right corner of the touchpad UNUSABLE as a touchpad. Are you telling me the fingerprint scanner cannot be placed to the right of the touchpad on all this empty space below the keyboard? Lenovo and other brands have figured this out already. I should have considered this when purchasing the laptop, but this is just really, really stupid design - unless I'm missing something. Even the part of the touchpad above and to the right of the fingerprint scanner does not actually work - it's just cosmetic. I'll be waiting for an explanation to this design choice, Asus.Speaking of poor design choices, what's with the lack of ventilation on this thing? There really is not any ventilation except for the hinge that I can see. You guys cram an i7 and 1070 in here and expect a hinge to cool it all when I'm gaming? Let me tell you from experience, that is not happening. Even when playing lightweight 2D games, the fan in this machine becomes annoyingly loud and is still inadequate to cool the hardware inside (yes, with proper atmosphere on a table). That means the keyboard and palm rests become uncomfortably warm to the touch, and the underside of this machine gets very *very* hot.Oh, did I mention it sometimes makes these weird electrical noises? if the CPU is being heavily utilized, it kind of sounds like high-pitched whine, but it's intermittent. I don't know what it is exactly, but I am an A+ certified PC technician and I know a computer is not supposed to sound like that.On a software note, out of the box I receive this popup very often: ""There is no email program associated to perform the requested action. Please install an email program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel."" I've already removed all the bloatware, and this is coming from dllhost/COM Surrogate. Mail app is already set to my default; other default apps don't work. I'm just going to wipe it and do a fresh install of Windows 10 Pro (which I also would have liked to see included on this model) so this isn't a big deal to me, but for a standard consumer that is not a PC technician this could be very annoying. It's sloppy and cheap that I received an error message moments after powering on the computer for the first time, and it continues to pop up randomly ever now and then.I could go on but I think that's enough for this review. My point is that I have been very happy with Asus for a long time, but this laptop feels incredibly cheap and not at all worth the price tag or the ""Pro"" moniker. I am suffering severe buyers remorse and probably will not be purchasing any Asus products in the future. I'm seeing way too much competition from other brand that offer better products. I do not recommend this laptop to anybody, and in fact I suggest you avoid it at all costs.",0
"I don't usually give reviews, but this little guy is perfect for homework and general use. It's not a super powerful machine, but for the price it is perfect for a homework type computer. I have a Mac for design and web development, but this laptop is great for what I need it for, I would suggest making use of one drive or an external hard drive for storage.",0
"Pros: Compact, lightweight, decent battery life. Chrome OS is efficiently minimalist.Cons: SLOW. Like really slow. Like ""takes several seconds just to load a basic webpage"" slow, and my WiFi is not the issue. Barely even runs a Zoom call and don't even think about doing anything else with the laptop while you're on that Zoom call.The screen resolution is also janky. It's a small screen so the resolution starts out small, and if you try to increase font size or zoom in, the conditional formatting doesn't work very well at all.I would not buy this laptop again and will be very wary of buying Samsung products in the future.",0

"A computer gamer for life here. I had HP, MAC Pro and recently got this ROG Strix Scar II (NVIDIA RTX 2070). Installed all my gaming platform and video rendering software and I am glad I bought this as my upgrade. Never had a lag. Boot up was fast and my gaming FPS is phenomenal. This is a good investment in terms of your gaming and video (4K) rendering needs. Features and design are sleek and sophisticated. A premium built I would say by the touch and feel. This machine also comes with all the support you need like MYASUS and Game First. It is also light weight compare to my MSI 17"". I am definitely brag and encourage gamers and videographers to invest in this machine. Thanks ASUS for this built!",0
"The 1080 resolution of the laptop feels as clear as my 27-inch 2K monitor, which I'm very satisfied with. If the computer screen could support 360-degree rotation, it would significantly enhance the user experience.",1
Boot up speed is great,0
I love this product as well as Amazon's support and assistance to provide me quickly with a replacement since the first unit is received was faulty on Arrival.,0
Gear fit and finish. Very well known brand that holds up to its name well.,0
After much research this is the best bang for your buck gaming laptop,0
This computer loads super fast and runs really quick,0
"This is a very nice laptop with an incredible 17-inch screen. While it doesn't have a touch screen, I don't miss it much having spent most of my career working on Macs. The keyboard is a little off-centered, but all in all, I really like this laptop a lot. Besides the screen, the most outstanding feature is that it's unbelievably light! I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend the LG Gram 17-inch to others looking for a large-screened laptop without having to sacrifice portability.",0
llego roto el producto en mal estado,0
Had this 2 days and already know I will need another laptop soon. it is NOT as advertised and is slower than my 20 year old tower. Over all quite dissatisfying.,0
"I am an engineering student and needed to upgrade as my previous laptop could not handle the programs I needed to run. Right away this laptop convinced me that I made the right choice buying it. I was able to run CAD and coding programs simultaneously without any issues. I also tested its capability in running games on a public network and it also exceeded my expectations. If you are looking for a high-speed laptop that performs as a PC, this laptop is the right choice.",0
I did not receive the product as described! Do not buy its a scam!,0
"The machine was a great deal and was running very well. My set up was mostly using an external monitor, and after the 2nd day, no display. After trying several suggestions online, and speaking with support, i had to send the system in for repair. It's been 15 days, and i barley have any deatails from ASUS. I strongly regret, NOT just sending this machine back for a full rebate. I only have a few days left to do that, but I won't have the machine back from Asus before then. I'm gonna be regreting having this machine the rest of it's life.",0
I had to return my unit to Amazon because of the bad pixel on the screen and horrible high coil whine on full load ;(,0
"We bought this and everything works fine, but there is NO DVD player as described and pictured, which is why we picked this specific laptop.",0
PERFECT LAPTOP FOR STUDENTS OR CASUAL USE!,0
WINNER WINNER APPLE DINNER...it is a gem...software setup cumbersome but once done...it kicks assTHe trackpad lil stiff on clicking to select...guess breaking in will solve it...Rosetta 2 had to be installed..so it can run intel based apps..if you get pop up ...install it...had me goingBut for the money..it is fast..and installed new update...loads of preinstalled goodies...APPLE got this one right...the webcam they should have splurged on...they couponed out ..but good enough...3rd party apps will fix,0
Thought this to be an ok mid- priced unit. Liked it at first. Then it kept dropping off line. The dreaded blue screen shot of rebooting. This happened about every 5-10 minutes. Two other computers in my house do not do that. Internet is fine. Sent it back as defective. They deducted $91.47 as a restocking fee. FOUND THAT TO BE EXCESSIVE. Do not buy this unit. Purchased a new one at Best Buy and it works perfectly.,0
"The Lenovo Legion 5 is an excellent laptop. It has a nice and simple design, lightweight, and performs very well on maximum settings on a lot of games.",0
"I'm not a computer expert by any means, but this laptop is beautiful and the quality and processing speed are better than any other computer I've ever owned. The back lit keyboard is also a nice touch",0
She love it,0
"The 8GB RAM can be a problem if you're using Windows. However, if you're a programmer, researcher etc and you usually run your code on a server this little cheap piece of hardware is the best you can get at this price. I'm running Archlinux on this (and mint from a usb boot) and it works great.",0
It is worth for the quality and durability.,0
real easy to travel with super light,0
Bought one year ago..mother board went out 3 days ago. Unable to repair according to technician.,0
Creo que es lo mejor qué hay en el mercado con este rango de precios. Muy recomendada. Llegó en 3 días 😀👍🏻,0
I don’t have a photo,0
"Great Alienware options like keyboard colors, etc.",0
"First off, I would like to say this product is amazing!! I love how fast it is and how synced it is with my iPhone. I recommend for college student because everything I need for school I can access on my laptop. The laptop itself and its speed is perfect. My only issue, and why I reviewed it for 4 stars, is in my first couple days of using it, it already scratched. I am very careful with it, so when I discovered a scratch that will not come off, I was very disappointed. I tried using toothpaste and water to get it off, but it has not done the trick. So please be careful when you buy this product, because like I said, it gets scratches very easily and they do not come off. Recommend getting a case before getting it or right after purchasing it!",0
"I have kept using it nearly a year. At the beginning, everything was fine. But 8 months later, it started to experience frequent and random reboot and blue screen. I tried every method I could find online, including but not limited to updating the drivers, forbidding some serviece, deleting anti-virus software....None of them works. Right now, I have to use it carefully. When I am working, I need to save frequently. When I am gaming, the only thing I can do is to pray that I will not suddenly disappear and leave my teammate alone with bosses due to the random reboot. If you search online you will easily find lots of similar complains but Lenovo apparently does not want to face the problem. Some people on the same boat sent it to repair and got the motherboard replaced but still experience the same problem after that. Maybe it's a problem of the hardware design, maybe there's some conflicts of drivers. Who knows?",0
Horrible laptop - DO NOT BUY. About to send in for its 3rd repair after only having it for 2 months.,0
"Nice, I ordered this just for simple web browsing and personal use. I wanted something simple and easy to use. This item is excellent and not bad for the price.",0
mousepad is aweful,0
Excellent for student life. I'm a college student and this little thing does everything I need it to do. It's simple to use and is quickly responsive.,0
Gift.,0
"I’ve been very happy with this MacBook and it’s integration with my my iPhone, iPad and Mac accessories. It’s light weight but feels substantial with the aluminum frame and the keyboard is crisp and responsive for a compact laptop.",0
"I run hard Cuda workloads, so I need a fast machine with an NVIDIA GPU.",0
Try to call asus customer service before buying asus products. I waited like 3 hours and still couldn't connect. Their laptops are very bad. Mine broke in 13 months. They asked $2k for a motherboard replacement.,0
This is the lightest-weight laptop I have ever used at about 2 pounds.,0
Nothing to dislike. Great product so far.,0
"speaks don't work very well, issues with hearing youtube videos, sound quality poor",0
"It's a great keyboard, great design, great performance.",0
good job lenovo,0
the USB adapter which is not working.,0
This laptop is probably the smoothest and nicest laptop I have worked with in my life.,0
"I got this laptop for the screen quality and because of good ratings. I quickly found out the camera isn't usable after dark--no matter how much you adjust the computer or the lighting in your setting. I've compared it to a very, very old Surface and a cheap tablet, along with 2 Lenovo's and it stands out in how TERRIBLE it is. Like humiliatingly bad with Zoom. Then after 12 months the touchscreen went out and when that was replaced the rest of the computer just had one problem after another. No facial recognition, freezes continually--literally a different problem each day. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER. I will never buy another Dell",0
"Llego en tiempo y forma, ultra silenciosa y potente para el home office. Me gusta que tenga teclado numerico a un lado, por lo que es super comodo. Recomendado",0
She is really happy.,0
Great value and device my youngest daughter loves it.,0
Great laptop while it lasted. Problem is that it did not last a year. One day the screen went black but the computer still worked. Used it on an external monitor but now it can only be used in the room the monitor is in.,0
"I put off buying one for so long because everyone I knew had an opinion on chrome books and kept calling them ""basically tablets"". It's a small little laptop. I use it for work, I have an external hard drive for storage. It's exactly what I needed!",0
Mint condition - only box was damaged. I highly recommend this laptop as it's sleek and fast.,0
if you're looking for a high standard of quality and portability then this laptop is the way to go!,0
"So far, so good. Great form factor and fast. Not too much bloatware, just uninstall McAfee crap. The screen looks good and the flat (non glossy) finish works well for clarity and wide angle of viewing. I travel often and replaced a 6 year old Acer ultrabook at about the same pricepoint. Since Acer isn't a high end brand, I hope to get similar long life out of this one. I'll update if it doesn't perform as expected.",0
I like this product. It runs debian with only a few hitches.,0
"The cámara it’s really good , so I just had my first problem with it I was doing homework and the screen started glitching so let’s see what happen",0
Using my sister working fine,0
"Had this for 6 months. Camera went out in 1 month, keyboard lights don't work, battery last 2 hours on just regular mode,",0
My granddaughter uses it for school work and for entertainment at home.,0
"After upgrading from 19 to Ubuntu 20.04 this laptop worked flawlessly, no tweaking needed.In Ubuntu 19 there were some very minor issues such has needing to turn off then on Wifi to unlock it when starting the computer. And also closing the laptop would exit all programs instead of just sleeping. However, all issues were gone after updating the OS to 20.04.PROS: Very smooth performance running Ubuntu. Everything works as expected.CONS: This is not intended to be portable, so it has a very short battery life and speakers are are louder than a Lenovo Yoga but no where near the speakers on a Mac Book (my work computer).I'm not a PC gamer but this laptop fits my needs of doing print work in Photoshop running through Virtual Box (just can't get into Gimp).",0
This laptop has gone through 3 Repairs/Replacements in less than half a year and still does not work. The Customer Service is a joke as well as they do not take my claim seriously enough to take drastic action to fix it offering at max 30 days of additional QUALITY SERVICE. The Company does not view my laptop as a FIRETEAM level issue after 3 repairs. Do yourself a service and do not buy Lenovo junk.,0
"The FHD 1080p screen is great. The backlit keyboard is a must have these days. the best part is that under a normal load (like most web sites) the processor fan is never on and stays cool on your lap. I'll never regret purchasing a new laptop with 16 Gb of ram. There is enough for every thing I run with plenty to spare. the one and only downside about this ASUS UX461FN is the fingerprint reader, it just does not work well enough for daily use.",0
Purchased 2 years ago worked great first few months then it started doing this thing were it says no internet. No matter how many times you reconnect it some days it just won’t work. Completely unreliable!,0
Looks and operates as it shouls. Doesnt heat up in my lap. Light weight.,0
"Product was as advertised, very pleased!",0
My tablet works great. No problems so far.,0
Great price for a excellent computer,0
"Very portable, good battery life, and I love the touch screen!",0
"This thing has juice, runs most games on either ultra, or high settings. I think it ran noisy when I got it, but just down load the nvidia setting, and turn on the quite setting, and life is good. Sometimes I use the turbo button but it's loud, use headphones with it. So anyways a great machine.",0
"I really had high hopes for this laptop but I found a couple of issues that caused me to return it. First, there was a little bit of backlight bleed on the bottom left side of the screen. While the screen was nice and there was the normal amount of IPS glow, the little white light bleeding through on the bottom left caused me some concern. Although it was not much, it was enough for me to wonder if it would get worse over time. Knowing that there have been some who have complained about screen issues, I did not want to take the chance.Second, the laptop had a few keys that had tactile issues. The #3, #4, and W were not as responsive and springy as the other keys. When I barely moved my fingers across the number row without applying pressure, I could feel that the #3 and #4 keys seemed to be off a little. It worked when typing but I could tell the difference between them and the other keys. The W key was not as bad but you could still feel the difference between it and the Q, E, A, and S. While they may have never caused any issues throughout the life of the laptop, I don't want to take that risk with a $1000+ laptop. I have seen videos and forum posts about this same model where keys are sticking and/or not responding. I did not want to send it to Lenovo for warranty service since I just bought it. Personally, I don't trust a device that has to receive warranty repairs right out of the box. Hopefully, Lenovo can address these issues because this seems like it could be a very great machine.",0
"This is an outstanding laptop. It is light & compact, and really powerful. I mostly use it for work/office stuff, stream a lot of videos and it does that great, and I game a little and it's more than capable for all aspects. HDMI out, plenty of USB plugs. Gets a little hot on the bottom so be wary of putting onto cloth surfaces without ventilation, but man does it run fast. Touchscreen is nice but I use it sparingly, thumbprint option is cool, and the graphics and sound are both very good.",0
"Originally, I purchased for my elderly mother to use while in the hospital recovering from heart surgery. Unfortunately, she passed away and I inherited the device. It's works well and meets all of my needs. I can play Pogo.com, browse the internet, read email, visit banking/business websites, etc. It's obviously not for heavy duty gaming or anything along those lines. I like that it's lightweight and not bulky. The battery lasts a good while.",0
Good product. Daughter is enjoying it.,0
Excellent laptop,0
"This laptop is nearly identical to my other lap top but has more memory making it faster. That was the main reason for replacement. I use if for large email files, pdfs. A nice additional feature is the back lit keyboard. It is ridiculous that the keys are silver on silver. The back light helps.",0
"Let's start with the hardware itself. I was worried the screen would be as terrible as some of these reviews indicate. In my opinion, the screen is just fine. It's probably not great in very bright sunlight, or for video or photo editing purposes. Otherwise, if you just want to do indoor office work, or browse the web, it's totally sufficient and not a reason to pass up this laptop. If you are already used to higher quality displays or have demanding display needs, stop being cheap and look to spend a bit more money.I like the feel and look of the keyboard but I don't like the layout so much. It's novel to include the keypad on a laptop of this size, but it's too close to the other keys. The result is that sometimes you hit the number pad instead of enter, or backspace. It's annoying but not a dealbreaker, and if you type a lot like I do, you'll probably find that you can develop a type of muscle/spacial-familiarity to where it becomes an infrequent issue very quickly.I bought this laptop to install linux on. It required a bit of wrangling with the BIOS to make that possible. Firstly, secure boot and some other settings need to be disabled in the BIOS. Next problem was, this machine does not seem to be capable of booting from the microSD card slot at all. I was able to boot off a USB-connected drive. Once I set the built-in storage interface mode to AHCI in the BIOS, I was able to complete my installation and everything works great. For the record I installed the ""elementaryOS"" distro.",0
So far so good. A nice product.,0
The unit delivered is like new. No damage and it powered up quickly. I did make a few changes to beef it up. Added more memory and installed an SSD drive. Very happy with the results,0
"This gaming laptop is really good for its price, works perfectly with battery and plugged to electricity works even better. Way better than others that are its price.",0
Nice sound quality when playing skyrim se with 100s of mods.,0
Love it. Easy to take along with you. Compact size.,0
Beautiful Product. Must recommended,0
I like the backlit feature that only lights up when in use.,0
"I had read a ton of reviews and watched a lot as well for the best gaming laptop I could get around the $1500 range. I was coming from a GTX 770 so this was a major upgrade. I wanted to future proof myself a bit while also not killing the wallet. The laptop has great screen resolution. I played all my games on ULTRA settings with no issues. The RGB keyboard (i was coming from an old PC) was a nice refreshing upgrade of levity. As stated by many other reviews, the battery life isn't the longest but this fits the bill for me. I wanted something that I would pretty much use at home plugged in and when needed, I could transport a gaming beast without having to lug a tower and monitor etc. Speakers leave more to be desired but honestly, I use a gaming headset and don't even think about it. Especially since I don't want to deal with any fan noise. All in all, considering the price and GPU/CPU u get at this price, it can't be beat.",0
"I have had this computer for a few weeks now. I got it on Black Friday and was forced to buy it used since the Walmart Black Friday deal was awful.So far it is a really good buy! I’m familiar with chromebooks as I used them to teach kids computer science.I specifically got this chromebook for class. I’m going into my junior year of college and up until this moment I have gotten away with not needing a computer. It is very light and small enough to carry around with no issues. It is very simple, just as I needed! Seems to be working great and charging just fine.Will update if anything changes but for now I think this is awesome for students, kids, and adults who just need something simple and cheap.",0
"I got a lemon. It didn't work, overheated as soon as I turned it on. Complete trash. And then after calling for over a month, and waiting for 2 months after I received confirmation that I returned the item and it was delivered by ups, I finally got a refund. Huge waste of time, get it somewhere else.",0
I was worried about buying a laptop refurbished but this didn't disappoint. Great value. Basically brand new. Highly recommended.,0
Like it being small and easy to use.,0
Nice looking laptop with a pretty decent keyboard and an excellent touchpad. Performs well with an average battery life. Overall a very good laptop priced very reasonably. Except for the USB and HDMI ports...I cannot stand the way MSI arranged the USB and HDMI ports flush with base frame. Because of this the connection is loose and if you happen to be using a USB device and bump it you will compromise the connection (which may corrupt data).,0
"Después de una exhaustiva búsqueda por una laptop con componentes de calidad y a un buen precio, puedo asegurar que está es la mejor.La caja llegó en perfectas condiciones, con sus sellos de seguridad y ni un solo rasguño.Los materiales de construcción del chasis se sientes cómodos al tacto, al igual que las teclas tienen una sensación de pulso suave, la iluminación de aura rgb es maravillosa pues tiene 3 niveles de intensidad además de diversos modos de iluminación (Ciclo de colores, estático, pulso, etc).El monitor con su panel ips de 144 hz es fantástico, pues en juegos competitivos como CS: GO te da una fluidez muy buena.El trackpad es muy preciso y suave, además de tener un gran tamaño para mayor movilidad.En conclusión, es un excelente equipo para su precio, quedé enamorado con las especificaciones y su desempeño.",0
"I bought this laptop for my wife for Christmas. She runs a small business, a sole proprietorship. She does artwork, so she does need some decent computing in addition to email and social media type activities. The laptop has a nice sized screen; it is constructed well (which is important because she's rough on equipment), and is a great value for the money.",0
Beware: BIOS is locked,0
After about 1 week I have constant blue screens with an error about power management drivers.I updated the BIOS and even performed a completely fresh install of windows and all the drivers with no luck. It will not wake from sleep and the TouchPad randomly stops working.Complete waste of time and money,0
incredibly thin top and side bezels make it look even better,0
"I love this laptop, I am able to play the Sims, watch movies, and search the web. Its a great laptop for every day usage.",0
Bought this for my daughter who is in nursing school and she LOVES it!,0
It's a great laptop for the price!,0
The fans can be a bit loud when the system is under load,0
"in the middle of the display, a big rectangular patch of grayish color.",0
Lovely laptop. Does the job well.,0
Laptop ramdomly shut off and never turned back on. Tried changing battery and charger. Motherboard must be fried. Only was used a couple hours a day. Is a pain to open up and do diagnostics.,0
I love it,0
"It's a chromebook not a laptop,sadly",0
"I'm happy with this laptop so far. Got the i7 version and it's very zippy. The feel and look isn't as premium as some other laptops I've had, but the performance for the price is a great value.",0
"This computer is amazing, very reliable. Its not heavy at all, which was an important feature for me because I use it for college. I don't think I'll ever buy another brand.",0
"Great computer for what I use it for. Connecting to the internet using office. Its light weight, very compact, and charges quickly. No complaints at all.",0
"no matter how I tried, I could not get it to power up",0
Easy for son to use,0
The speakers are not top quality and a little bit of a bummer for a college student.,0
"after about two months, the battery is not holding a charge for very long.",0
The amount of updates you have to perform is ridiculous it took literally half a day to get everything up and running on the computer.,0
"Leí muchas rese?as del artículo por eso me anime a comprarla, hasta ahora, me ha parecido una buena compra, la velocidad del procesador muy buena, el lector dactilar me encanto muy útil, lo único con lo que tengo reserva es la carcasa, que es plástico y siento que podría ser frágil, buena resolución de la pantalla, y el tama?o me encantó, muy amplia, esta configurada en idioma inglés, pero muy facil de cambiar a espa?ol, sigo a la expectativa, pero hasta ahora todo pinta bien.",0
"Now first off, this is not a powerbook, or any high end high power notebook computer. We have pretty basic internet and computing needs. We currently own 3 ipads, 2 iphones, ad 2 ipod touches. These and their predecessors have mostly served 100% of our internet needs over the last 5 or years. However our school aged children have started having some issues with homework. Our school district uses iready (funny that it uses a moniker similar to Apple), and iready does not work on any of our i-devices. It works with google chrome. Now there may be some clunky backdoor way to get it to work through a chrome page on an i-device, but that is just going to complicate the situation.I figured if Chrome is the preferred operating system, then a Chromebook would be ideal. Doing some math homework, and some reading homework, on a notebook is not supercomputer stuff, so these budget Chrome books really looked to fit the bill. Plus we prefer using ipads for most internet stuff anyway, so I did not want to buy a high end machine. I found a great deal on a brand new Samsung Chromebook (I know Apple fan, buying Samsung. I do own Samsung stuff:Robot vac, refrigerator, camera, on and on), and this thing is perfect for its intended task. Oh, and it is fun to mess around with on other stuff as well. I got the 4 GB ram version so I could do more stuff, more quickly. I opened several windows, and messed around on the internet for a while and I could not lag it down. Now we do have Spectrum 100/100 internet, and I get about 113 mbps via my Orbi wifi network, so my internet is very fast.My kids are finally able to do all their iready homework, including extra math. The results are showing in test scores. I wish I had gotten this thing last year, they would be way ahead of the game. We kept hearing iready will be apple ready soon. 18 months later, I gave up and ordered this Chromebook, and it is worth every penny.This is the perfect setup for students. It is larger than an ipad, but small enough to be easily portable. It is fast enough to handle most any task you throw at it. I cant ask for more!I'll update if the honeymoon period wears off.",0
"I don't mean this to sound negative because this beast has delivered more than I expected, but there are some points to be made. Firstly, my laptop arrived with a dead pixel on it, which isn't such a bad thing, it's just I needed the laptop in a certain amount of time because I was going somewhere so I had no time to get it fixed or replaced, which MSI says that it will do within a year of purchasing the laptop. The things I don't really enjoy is how frail it is. The amount of screen damage that has been inflicted onto this laptop is astounding in relation to how well I treat it. At this rate I feel as though I should have put a fabric sheet in-between it and the keyboard every time I close it. It's not like I'm putting caltrops in-between the laptop when I close it, but maybe it's simply just sand that's causing the damages. I'm not a sand seller and if it is the problem it's singular specs. In total i've got a dead pixel here, a scratch there, another scratch there, all I can think about is how much it's going to cost me to fix this screen, but that's a future me problem. And hopefully a future problem for you aswell, a problem I hope you find a solution for, the person purchasing this laptop. Otherwise it will run whatever you want, I mean what can't a RTX 2060 run? Also there's a factory seal sticker blocking you from removing the bottom plate of the laptop, which I hope isn't a void sticker in addition because you need to remove the bottom plate to insert any sort of additional storage device, because I can guarantee you that if you bought this laptop to play videogames the 500gb M.2 isnt going to cut it one bit. So just start off by buying an additional WD 1-2TB 2.5in SSD and probably just get a Samsung 970 Evo 1-2tb M.2 also to replace the one that the laptop comes with and just sell the 500gb one to someone who needs a M.2. The laptop gets hot but it's expected and with the max fan button it can still get too hot to leave on your skin or shorts. The battery lasts about 30 seconds not on charge, that's an exaggeration but don't expect to take more than a breath or two without it on the charger. 144Hz is a fantastic refresh rate to play videogames on, once you go to it, you don't go back. Also maybe I'm just stupid and didn't see that this screen was G-sync but i've never seen any screen tearing. The keyboard even though it can change colors doesn't have the same compatibility to do color changes as a external SteelSeries keyboard, like the apex pro. This review is getting long but these are things that I think are necessary to talk about, especially if you're thinking about buying a gaming laptop. Also you can change the global settings from the Nvidia control panel to force the computer to always use the RTX but if you don't some games will naturally choose the onboard graphics unit via the processor, so if you're having problems with framerate open up the settings and see what video device it's using. The keyboard feels nice and clicky, and so does the mousepad which I really like, I don't use the mousepad but I like that it's clicky. The speakers are abysmal, my phone is louder than the speakers, but they have Nahimic which will louden up things. Mine doesn't work anymore and just crashes as soon as it launches but that's neither here nor there, I need to reinstall it. I can't think of anything else to say.",0
I love that this laptop can turn into a tablet,0
"This thing is fast -- like 5 times faster than its physically identical Intel predecessor. So fast that it divides users into two ages of computing: pre-M1 and post-M1. 8GB of RAM in M1-land goes a lot, lot, further.Secure your seat in the post-M1 era with this $800 entry-ticket (and sell all your pre-M1 junk), because this 2020 model is fully modern, mostly holding up to the M2.",0

A little heavier than I expected,0
"I purchased this computer about 2 or three weeks ago and used it extensively the first few days as I needed to work on the move. I see clients on line through Zoom and other platforms. I was not happy with the initial camera quality for the price and prestige of the brand and this model. If I had my camera on it would freeze zoom and kick me out then say that my camera was not available for the rest of the session.I have read on the acer forum that this is a known issue and there are no real resolutions to it. As I already have a Logitech Brio camera I have just attached that and have not had an issue since.If you are looking to depend on the internal camera for the work or gaming/streaming that you are doing, this is NOT your computer. If you don't care about the camera then this is a powerful and functional laptop.",0
Had some issues with the display and audio drivers not working a month in,0
The computer works fine and Im happy with my purchase. The box does smell like mold? I saw other reviewers post prior to purchasing - just thought I’d mention it’s def a thing. No issues with the computer itself so far. I haven’t had it long though.,0
Awesome value,0

PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!,0
"Product is defective and seller refuses to do anything because we missed the return window by TWO DAYS. Chrome book will not charge and just says “calculating” in battery bar. We received the item Mid July, but admittedly didn’t even open the box until last week because it was to be used only for virtual homeschool. That started Monday morning and by Tuesday morning the thing was dead as a door knob. I essentially bought a over priced paper weight for my child. I reached out to the seller myself AND asked Amazon to step in and help and the seller is still refusing to do anything. During a pandemic, when lots of families are having to shell out funds they don’t have for devices like this. Shame on this company!!!",0
"Just like most other people are saying, the battery life is not the greatest. Plugged in, everything else is good. Remember to put the GPU in eco mode or use integrated graphics if you're not gaming on battery.",0
"Run all games smooth butter, fans a bit loud but I think is necessary for the GPU card. I liked the bottom design, seems to have great cooling system. Speakers are bad, but once you add Nahemic drivers it gets better. Screen is awesome at 144hz. So far, very satisfied that it works for gaming. I tried others with RTX 1660 Ti and just couldn't run playable games, by far this is the best value you can get.",0
"I used the NVIDIA optimized selections, the game didn't run fast",0
"A very modern computer with an on screen camera to see zoom and go to meetings, etc.",0
Battery life is also good enough,0
I love it! Great value!,0
"This computer sends me a message that there is an upgrade. Then its asks if I want to upgrade, it may not compatible with my system. Don't the company know whether the upgrade is for my computer? Not feeling this laptop at all. It has shut down for no reason other than a recent update and will not turn back on. I'm done!",0
"No complaints so far - in fact, I am actually very impressed! The battery life is incredible (although I have only had it for two days!) and the screen, keyboard, and body are great. I had a Macbook Pro (2012) eons ago and this is obviously far and above that.I was a bit nervous buying from Amazon but I was impatient and couldn't wait the 2+ weeks it was going to take from Apple or Best Buy. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.",0
"I needed a new computer desperately, (screen broke and volume malfunctioned on my beloved old Asus transformer), so after much research about Macs online, I ordered a new MacBook Air. Most of the online reviews and info praised it except for the camera, and in this current pandemic Zoom world, that was a must! However, I couldn't imagine a new apple computer having a worse camera than my old iPhone 6 which I am still happily using, so I took a chance! The laptop is awesome on so many levels! New M1 chip, super fast everything, and fantastic color display!The sound and yes, the camera, are phenomenal! I can only assume the bad camera reviews were made by video bloggers that need extreme HD resolution. I just do average work on my computer, so no problem there! I am thoroughly enjoying surfing online, streaming videos, and Zooming with great clarity. I needed to clarify this camera issue for those holding back from purchasing such a great computer just due to those negative camera opinions, as I was. If I had read my review or one similar to it, it would have eased my mind. So, unless you're a vlogger , fear not!It's a fantastic computer in every sense of the word! (Not to mention the $999 price for a new Mac!) Get it!!! You won't regret it! The rose gold is especially pretty!",0
I am very satisfied with my laptop. The price was well within my budget.Thank you,0
"No pude contactar al vendedor, el equipo en general pareciera que está bien, sin embargo trae u. Problema con el micrófono, no lo detectaba, luego descargué los controladores y se escucha un sonido horrible, por lo que al preguntar a un técnico me dice que esta da?ada la pieza… evidentemente no le he dado mal uso y es algo que traía desde que me la vendieron. Yo estoy muy decepcionado, soy maestro y ocupo la máquina en óptimas condiciones.",0
This was a waste of money. It is very restricted and restricting. It locks the Usenet into chrome etc.,0
You can’t add anything to this unless it’s in the chrome store. Wanted it as a spare for using with a zebra printer solely used to ship my ebay items out of our basement. No luck. It will NOT work.,0
"Fast to start up, has worked well with occulus link/virtual reality games (half life alyx and Asgard's wrath) at medium settings as advertised. If you turn up VR settings to high you will definitely get high CPU and GPU temperatures, but i would say this is expected for a laptop.Overall, definitely recommend for the price point.",0
"I wish I could give it zero stars. Complete and utter junk. Despite my TLC, the screen completely failed after THREE months of use! I was told by the HP online tech support that I could return it for repair under warranty. That included an additional fee for shipping and handling. I subsequently got a phone call from the HP repair center (rip off center) informing my that they wanted to charge me over $300 for a non-warranty repair. (Where did that come from?) After seeing what she could do to ""help me out"" the rep offered me a repair for $298. Which also was the prince of a brand new model as showing on Amazon. Keep away from this horrible company. They sell junk then rip you off again when you seek service.",0
"Lite weight, good looking, nice screen, fast at a good price. Will buy another.",0
It has a powerful four-core Intel processor,0
Not a touchscreenOkay chromebook does not hold a charge!!!!,0
I wouldn’t recommend this computer. I got it a while ago. I got it for school it worked great for like 2-3 months then it crapped out on me. I took it to a computer shop and they told me the hard drive is messed up. I barely put anything on that computer and now I have to pay $200 to get it repaired.,0
"I get it...some people hate WoW, lol but it's the game I play and I've always wanted to play it with the highest settings and now I can, without my laptop shutting off because it gets too hot. I'm also amazed that I can play wow and also minimize it while scrolling for recipes, fb etc without things freezing or extreme lag. This is the first gaming laptop I've ever had, so maybe my expectations are low to begin with but I really love it. The only thing I worry about is the charger. It's gets pretty hot. Maybe someone can answer that question for me about the heat. I also don't like that I can't choose to have the red backlight for the keyboard on without it shutting off. Other than those two things, I love this laptop. Seems like a beast so far lol",0
"The fan is not working now, and of course warranty and support expired in June. No computer I've owned has had a problem like that so soon. Overall I've been disappointed with this computer. It uses more power than most laptops. I travel and live off-grid most of the time. I attempted to get a 12v charge cord so i wouldn't need to run it through my inverter but wasn't able to find one. So that was my first disappointment.It didn't have the hard drive storage I thought it was going to have. I do digital art, photography and videos so this was my second disappointment. I looked at so many laptops before I bought I guess I just didn't remember which one had what features. I also was limited to laptops where I could make monthly payments.I probably shouldn't have asked my grandson who's a gamer for advice in selecting the right computer for me. Because of my art/video needs I thought it would be a good choice. Not so much so.Now I'm having to figure out how to find and replace the fans.",0
Does what I need and for a great price from the Treasure Truck,0
its well worth it for the excellent cooling and design.,0
good computer,0
"If you buy the warranty it does nothing, they won't respond to you and it's stops charging after a few months.",0
"Pros:- Very crisp, colorful screen.- Excellent keyboard.- Great styling- Top-notch combination of components- Minimal bloatware from the manufacturerCons:- Horrible touch pad. Hopefully will be fixed with a driver update, but lags and skips terribly.- Lid shows fingerprints easily.- Battery life is only about 30 mins more than my (also gaming) laptop from 2013, expected a bit better from newer, more efficient components- They really should have put a 512 GB ssd in, 256 is going to fill up very quickly.- Needs another USB-C connectorI have had no issues with heat / overheating, like some of the other reviews.Proformance loss when unplugged / on battery is to be expected to extend already limited battery life.",0
"This was my first Razer product, I was in the market for a slim laptop with a decent battery life and enough horses under the hood to game occasionally. The build quality of the laptop is excellent, although the exterior is prone to show fingerprints & scratches, so a protective skin is highly recommended. The battery life is pretty impressive (5-7 hours), given the hardware specs. The only complaint I have is that my charger stopped working after 16 months of ownership, I expected all of the components to be robust given the price tag.",0
Amazing product.,0
Not as good as my Asus. Weaker battery and especially wifi range is shorter.,0
"The screen cracked on this within a year, though it wasn't dropped. Tried to contact seller- told me to go through lenovo. Lenovo only offers a 9 month warranty. Not work $200 for 9 months of use.",0
"Just after the service window closed, the dreaded HP laptop hinge problem reared itself on this newer model. A few months after that, the HD failed completely. This should have been a great machine that lasted at least 3 years. Never buying HP again.",0
This is my first time to buy a MacBook and it did not disappoint me. I love the battery life of this laptop and it very good use for my. studies.,0
"i'm happy, cause the laptop was a gift, and it is all right, no problem with the OS, it's a fast machine and so.",0
"Generalmente Acer no suele resaltar a la hora de nombrar las mejores marcas de Laptop del Mercado, pero con esta Laptop Aspire 5 hicieron un gran y excelente trabajo con este equipo que se ofrece a un precio muy accesible y se nota está dise?ada para el futuro. Es perfecta para hacer trabajos ya sea de oficina, de dise?o y para las clases en linea, si quieren una Laptop para jugar videojuegos esta no es ninguna opción para eso.Posee un buen tama?o y es bastante ligera, cuenta con teclado numérico pero lamentablemente se trata de un Teclado en Inglés, eso significa que la letra ? no está en el teclado y obliga a aprender un poco sobre donde está ubicado cada simbolo en el Teclado si lo usas en Espa?ol.Como mencioné la Laptop está pensada a futuro, esta se puede abrir para a?adir mas memoria si consideras que los 4GB de RAM que posee no es suficiente y permite además insertar un segundo disco duro por si consideras que los 128 GB que posee por defecto no son suficientes, por cierto la unidad de almacenamiento principal es una unidad NVME lo que garantiza un arranque casi inmediato al encender el equipo. Por cierto dentro de la caja del equipo viene incluido unos tornillos para instalar la segunda unidad de almacenamiento, lamentablemente no vienen instrucciones para hacer la instalaciones y hay que buscarlas en Internet.Con tanto positiverío debería haber algo negativo, la pantalla fue lo que menos cuidaron a la hora de dise?ar este equipo, la calidad y nitidez de la imagen no es tan buena y para los que trabajan en dise?o se les dificultará un poco trabajar por el poco rango de color que posee la pantalla, no es mala pero si toma tiempo en adaptarse. Por otro lado el equipo dice tener Alexa integrado, pero no encuentro como usarlo y lo único que veo de la función de Alexa es que en la pantalla de bloqueo me avisa si algún paquete de Amazon va a llegar durante el dia.NOTA: Es una mentira que viene con Windows 10 instalado, cuando me llegó venía ya con Windows 11 instalado y nunca me dio la opción de regresar a W10, tuve que descargar la herramienta de instalación que Microsoft ofrece en su sitio web para no perder la licencia, tomen eso en cuenta si no les gusta Windows 11 y no quieren perder tampoco la licencia al instalar W10.",0
Display quality is excellent- colors pop,0
This computer freezes constantly. I used it for literally one day and it froze at least a dozen times. It's also not easy to use. I am returning this.,0
the touchscreen is responsive,0
Incredibly easy to use quick response and light,0
"Love my new Acer Chromebook! I am a huge Chromebook fan anyway, and already have 2, but needed a larger one for school. So far, I am beyond pleased with my purchase and give it 5 stars!",0
"Have been using it only for a few days now, it's been ok. The only thing is that the volume is extremely low!! Very disappointing",0
I am having a lot of fun designing keyboard light layouts,0
I use my laptop mostly to produce music but this laptop can handle all my plug-ins and is fast,0
"Good value,I use it for music productionJust get a 16Gb memory for a better experience.",0
Son loves it for gaming and his college classes.,0
Bought it for my son. He likes it,0
Excelente producto,0
"Much quieter than I expected, even when the fans are at full speed, the noise is minimal, when using headphones the fans cannot be heard at all.",0
Had to contact seller for a new battery and they came through and sent one. Overall great computer!,0
"Upon initial set up, immediately after opening, cannot read the screen. Has double information (like double screen?) which makes it so you cannot clearly see any of it. Pink & Green? what its that? The ""free help line"" we tried to contact would not answer the phone unless you paid $14.50 to talk to them! Returning this ASAP.",0
"Honestly this thing was supposed to be super basic and easy to use. But the ACER laptop had bad quality issues. The screen had dead pixels in it, and one of the keys poped off. The battery life was also not very good. I am surprised how bad it is, but I wanted to let everyone know so that they dont regret the purchase like me.",0
I have had my laptop for 6 months and am still happy with my purchase.,0
I am in love with this laptop. I'm a student and it works great for projects. I also play world of warcraft and can play with ease with all the settings on high. And the keyboard is super fancy and lights up.,0
"To start with this is efficiently built/designed laptop and no less compared to other laptops.First and foremost, the speed it boots up and restarts is pretty amazing. Came in nice packaging and on time delivery. The setup was pretty easy and comes with pre-loaded Windows 11. The screen quality is very good and soothing to eyes. Keypad is smooth and the keys seems to be pretty durable and last long.A laptop of 512GB SSD memory and 16 GB RAM to get at this price is very good. The 4-core Intel Celeron processor has a good processing speed.It come with following ports which is more than sufficient to connect different devices.HDMI Port, USB-A 3 ports, USB-C 1 port, Ethernet Jack, HeadPhone Jack, Memory Card slot.The 15.6 inch screen size is decent and serves the purpose. The battery life is good so far and no issues with it. It has good quality Webcam too. The weight of the laptop is pretty good and portable. Overall for the price and speed of laptop this is a pretty good buy.",0
"it has overheating/thermal throttling problems and you dont feel like you get your full value off of the 1050ti plus you can build a better pc overall with that kind of money, dont recommend you buy this crap",0
"I loved this Chromebook. Clear screen, fast, perfect for school or work. it just doesn't work anymore after your cat knocks over soda onto the laptop. Wish I could have this same laptop again.",0
"Great laptop for gaming, as you can see on my desktop I have World of Warcraft, some games on steam and origin -Sims 4 - I run discord constantly- and call of duty all installed and I am able to stream my games live, the camera and mic are just fine for being on a laptop, I prefer to use a headset for live streaming, everything looks crisp I never lag it’s been a real reward having this computer, I have filled up the hard drive and will invest in external:)",0
I love my new laptop! It's light and i'm able to take it on the go.,0
This computer works well for internet browsing but we have had so many error messages where the computer randomly shuts down in the middle of school lessons. I would not purchase this product again. We haven’t downloaded anything and it has had many problems running the way it came!,0
Not needed,0
I absolutely love this gaming laptop! I am a truck driver and I needed something to be able to game on the road away from my desktop and this laptop does the job! MSI did an amazing job with the design it’s nice and sleek! The performance is a 10/10! I play Escape From Tarkov and Elden Ring. I can play both games on high to ultra settings no problem. I would highly recommend this laptop. The only thing I had a concern about was the GPU. The GPU is a 3070 and runs off of 85 watts. After getting the laptop and putting it to the test my concerns were eliminated.,0
"The S mode is my biggest turn off. This laptop is good for kids or light use. To be usable for more ... the SSD, RAM and OS should be upgraded. But, that is still cheaper then buying something with all these upgrades already installed.",0
"I received the item and the computer monitor won’t turn on, so now I have to send it back and go purchase another computer.",0
"The audio quality leaves a lot to be desired, especially when compared to the visual prowess of the 1080p display. The speakers lack richness and depth, which is disappointing for a device at this price point. An upgrade to a high-fidelity audio system would elevate the multimedia experience significantly.",1
"Build quality is great, the screen is awesome and responsive.",0
Love the clean look of the keyboard without having a cramped numpad,0
"Well I will hate to admit it, but the previous comment regarding the track pad is still an issues. While using the track pad, it feel unnatural and wobblily, and I willing to bet it will get you upset.",0
"I bought Lenovo flex 5 on April 2, 2018 and after 5 months the screen started flickering which is very annoying. I don't know what to do and feel a waste of my money. I'm going to try to get this returned to the manufacturer if I could. I've been making it work despite of the flickering the moment I get on this. It looks like hardware issue but I'm not going to mess around with this issue.",0
This chrome book cannot connect to the internet from my basement. My HP laptop does fine. Disappointed by this. Cannot really comment on anything else since I have not used that much because of this lack of connection power.,0
"Battery dies fast, but in other aspects this laptop is 10/10!",0
OLED pannel is stunning at full brightness,0
the machine doesn't get exceptionally warm,0
It’s not Perfect deal,0
"Im not a tech person so i had to google a few things as far as how to do things on this laptop (copy/paste, scroll using the mouse pad..heck i didmt even know it had touchscreen until this review). Im on the laptop long enough to do my homework (3hours) havent had a battery issue though. So far so good.",0
"I'm not playing games but I wanted something strong enough to work in ZBrush and to do 3d rendering once in a while. So I'm watching YouTube videos, doing nothing in the background and the loud fans wind up. I have it on an open frame tilt stand to keep it off the desk and I keep my room very cool; from 63° to 68° in the fall and winter on days that are cool enough like today.They give you room for another SSD and a hard drive but you can't install them it appears without voiding the warranty? I'd like to hear from Acer on this. I want to put a hard drive in this thing since they gave us the space to do so.",0
"I just got my item, and I found a little problem with the right corner of the screen. Do you see it’s a bit crushed on the side? You can definitely tell the differnce with the left corner that I attached for the last pic. I’m so disappointed.",0
"Laptop suddenly died. Black screen, no charging light. No warning. Lost all programs and data that was loaded. Only had it 5 weeks.",0
Showed a little more wear than I expected. Seems to work of.,0
"I absolutely love this laptop. Touchscreen is amazing, plus the versatility in being able to fold the screen completely back into a tablet. Tons of power in the processor and the RAM included. It's just a perfect tool for either home or work use, and I should know - I do both with it!",0
The amount of updates you have to perform is ridiculous it took literally half a day to get everything up and running on the computer. After all was said and done I got the blue screen 3 times...Under load it gets pretty loud you will be able to hear it across the living room. When you plug in the charger there is a static sound coming from the laptop. The startup sound is really unnecessary and annoying. I have contacted Asus but if I have to ship it out to them I’m not shipping it for repairs I’m shipping it for a refund. For a $2k laptop it was a really disappointing buy.,0
"At first it was all okay but after some usage, the metal screen frame started to levitate from bottom and made hard to open the computer. I have sent to ASUS for repair, received now but nothing seems changed. I think the product is defective or it is second-quality. I don't recommend this product. Additionally, it is so hard to get your problem solved by the actual people who can help in terms of replacement or refund.",0
Es un muy portatil que aunque no conozco mucho de estos este me ha parecido muy bueno tiene buen desempe?o pero la bateria a veces consume mas de lo que el cargador entrega y consume tanto como cargador como bateria. En pruebas de 3DMARK obtuve un puntaje de 8500.Complementando la rese?a anterior hasta el momento despues de 6 meses el computador se ha portado excelente y no he tenido ningun clase de problemas de hardware. Eso si tengo una base adicional para proteger el equipo y ademas uso las combinaciones de teclas especiales para activar el boost.,0
De mon avis personnel j'aime la fonctionnalité de ce portable,0
"the laptop kept locking up and had to be battery reset several times. Really a pain was afraid several times it was not going to start up again. only had about week or so and had all kinds of issues with it. I have had several laptops and never this kind of issue. must be a flaw in design, i returned laptop and bought different Aspire 5 so far working great.",0
The item was as described,0
windows 11 = bad,0
"after 1 week of usage laptop shut down with blue screen automatically, is happens many time in a day , not sure what the problem is.",0
Perfect For medium specs games,0
"My old computer finally failed and I did a lot of research on new ones. I finally settled on this one and it, so far, was a great choice.",0
"I am disappointed in this product. I had an Acer Chromebook that I used for about 4 years. I wanted a bigger screen size and it was starting to slow down, so i replaced it with this model. For the past few months iot has been shutting off while I am using it. It now happens so frequently that it's basically useless. I've already ordered an HP Chromebook. Hope I have better luck with that .",0
"Wow, this laptop after three months of use, is great and capable. Every game that ive installed on this, works at 1080p ultra and more than 60/144fps . I've used to make videos as well with 4K footage from a a6300 Sony camera, with da Vinci resolve, works amazing for this hard tasks. The keyboard is amazing, and even when you will encounter a plastic laptop, doesn't matter, because the construction seems sturdy enough. This one is for my girlfriend now, cus I've bought another msi, the pulse gl66 with a rtx3070. And overall they seems to be the same performance laptop!",0
"I bought this computer for my friend.it took him 1 month to arrive and I was impatient to give it to him when he arrived. the computer was running slowly, I could only open 2 tabs through chrome. I tried to solve the situation first. I spoke to acer in my country and they said they weren't interested. I told Amazon about this situation, and they asked me to fix it and tell them how much the fee costs. I somehow solved the problem, but the problem happened to me again. acer officials said there was a problem with the device's graphics card. I asked what I could do for the defective product. unfortunately, no one could help because I bought it from another country.I contacted ups and dhl to ship the product to Amazon. they asked for more money than Amazon could afford. currently, I have shipped the product with a local shipment, and the product will arrive in Amazon in 1 month. I'm ashamed of my friend. we had to wait for his money to be refunded so he could buy a computer again. I do not recommend buying acer computers from outside the United States .",0
"I own a MacBook Pro and wanted a cheaper option for a smaller laptop. After seeing the screen quality and lack of functionality since you’re basically locked inside Chrome, I sent it back immediately.I’ll just drop the extra money on a small MacBook.Terrible screen quality. Save yourself the trouble.",0
"Good laptop for the price., I was surprised. Touch screen works well. Great for someone wanting to browse the internet, email and play a few games. Easy to use and set up.",0
it is so light to carry it all the day around.,0
"Nothing I didn't like, this little laptop is perfect!",0
Juts received it and I totally love the color. Setting up as i type and happy I got this computer,0
I love it and I will buy another one now.,0
"I researched for hours and came up with this Acer Predator Helios. Worked right out of the box. Note - my edition had two 8 GB memory sticks, and I bought two more 16 GBs to replace it and ""go all the way"". I also bought a 1 TB hard drive to finish the job.I can set games to ultra graphics settings for the first time ever!! I use a towel and a travel pillow when I use it on my lap.Screen is amazing, the laptop is as fast as can be. Very pleased!!",0
It's perfect. No concerns in any area.,0
Stopped working in less than 2 months and been trying to get a refund contacted seller and amazon customer service more than 6 weeks ago and didn’t hear a word back from them the laptop is just junk,0
the texture of the laptop feels quite nice and it definitely turns people's heads when they realize that this portable laptop can out perform most home built desktops for about the same price.,0
"It works for what I use it for. I don't use the touch screen for personal reasons, so I can't rank that.",0
"Great laptop, high performance for workstation and graphics tasks.",0
Not enough for VR.,0
"This is the second ASUS laptop that I have bought. I needed a new one after about 7 years, and I wanted something smaller and lighter, especially as I would be travelling. (The bigger one was harder to carry to college, which was one of its cons.) The new laptop is exactly what I wanted! I love holding it because it's so small, and I look forward to being able to carry it around without trouble.I will try to update when I have had a chance to use it more.",0
"I don’t know what the hell happened, I disconnected my computer from the tv and now my laptop won’t turn on. I wouldn’t recommend plugging it into your tv. However it works well.",0
"We ordered 2 of these, a few months apart., and just discovered that the features (ports and memory) are not as described. We discovered that the model sent is labeled N15Q8 with another label stuck on that says C7KD. I've verified that it is actually N15Q8 which is an inferior model.",0
"great laptop. nice design, light weight, fast. 1 year later, so far so good.",0
The screen was very good though crystal image,0
"so far so good! I'm writing this on it now. It's challenging to learn a new OS, but I'm not lacking from anything. Don't even miss the delete key!",0
"This is definitely a gamer's laptop. I was able to play my Xbox Anywhere games without any problem. I didn't notice any lag. It felt like I was playing the game on my Xbox One.The only thing that's awkward for me is the touchpad. I prefer the touchpad in the center. However this laptop has it placed toward the left side. If I was left handed it would be great, but I'm not. However, I am adjusting.With that said, I still give it 5 stars because the processing power and the amount of hard drive storage is so great.",0
"Really light, fast, capable. Everything it says. Amazing for its price.It only has a sort of click in at the top side of the screen. Exactly when the lit closes. Don't know if it's a defect or not but looks like defective. Like thst screen doesn't fit completely st that section and it leaves a click. But is not a button to close the lit.",0
Easy to set up and a very good computer..,0
"What a piece of crap, wont charge. Acer needs a 10 days to send out new charger, might not fix the problem. NEVER BUYING AN ACER AGAIN. Also window s mode is a bunch of crap. Dont buy this. Amazon this is a problem.",0
TouchPad left click failed and keeps getting stuck and won't spring back up.,0
Lmao!!!! Intel is hurting so bad they need to copy AMD use the word Zen to sell anything. Team Blue is failing hard. This product would be amazing if it had an AMD Ryzen APU. GG,0
"I haven't even started using this yet and already I am unhappy with it. Amazon advertises this as having an SSD drive, but it does not. It has the cheaper and not as good eMMC drive. I've looked up the model number online and apparently, this particular model number only comes with eMMC, so this was false advertising on the part of Amazon. I'm going to have to think about this some more and decide whether to keep it or return it.",0
a great buy for someone looking for a great all around laptop.,0
I have gotten to the point where I lock the touchpad whenever I am typing something for a length of time because I have already accidentally deleted two pages of an assignment... twice.,0
"The laptop arrived on time. Its specs are very good for the price point. There doesn't seem to be another laptop with these specs at this price at the moment. Hard to find a 2070 for this price. Pleased with the build quality. Keyboard and trackpad feels good. Aesthetics-wise, the back side where the MSI logo is found can be a bit too gamer-y (especially compared to the stealth line of MSI), but in general, it's not very offensive anyway. Another gripe I have is that it is somewhat chunky for a normal laptop nowadays, but I feel that it is somewhat expected for a gaming laptop so that is not really a problem. It is just something to note for some people. It is also important to say though that it is LIGHT, despite how chunky it is. RGB is also very good compared to other gaming laptops if that is a consideration.Overall, I'm happy with the laptop. I would recommend purchasing this.",0
"Why I took so long to get a chromebook is beyond me. The best purchase I ever made. It takes minutes to set up. Runs so fast, and is easy to use. I love the fact that there are not a bunch of programs already on the computer. I use my computer for personal home use: paying bills, watching movies, surfing the web, checking email. The battery life is INCREDIBLE! if you want an every day computer that is easy to use and boots up quickly, this is for you.",0
"It's a great weight, a great feel (aluminum case), and the specs are so great",0
It feels great and looks great.,0
"So far, this laptop has been able to run everything I've thrown at it. I mainly got it for FF14, which it can run on max setting at a smooth 120-144 FPS, even in the more intense areas with lots of people. It's also very quick and has tools built in to customize your experience based on the type of game or application you are running. I also love the backlight keyboard and you can change the color of the keys as well as their color pattern. It's got everything you'd want in a gaming laptop, especially for the price.",0
I purchased this laptop on May 27th. It abruptly stopped working on August 29th. Apparently the support window ends on August 26th and there is now way to get help with this issue.,0
Setting it up is a breeze thanks to Windows 10 and Cortana,0
"Es muy rápida, y cumple con lo que dice la rese?a... El problema es que salió defectuosa del sonido, hace ruidos muy extra?os de pronto, en distintas situaciones",0
it really takes hours to make it work,0
"It's true, it gets really loudly, but u know that u a putting good stuff inside a small place, so it's normal that happens.You can customize the fans, the lighting, everything. I'm glad i made this choice, the price is the most amazing thing, so if you can get this laptop lower than $1000 don't doubt it.",0
how light it is,0
"As a computer consultant, I can guarantee that Chromebooks are super reliable and dependable!",0
No work.,0
"Accurate specs, fast boot under 10 seconds nice screen.",0
"This computer runs amazingly so far. Crazy fast. I've got the 3080ti with 12700h version. I'm also using a very nice laptop cooling board underneath it.But after playing one of my favorite games for only a couple minutes, the keyboard is almost too hot touch. Seriously, if I were to hold my palm down for more than 5 ish seconds, on the plastic area right above the f keys, I would get quite literally get a 3rd degree burn!Running msi afterburner to see how hot it is internally it's running at a steady 185 degrees Fahrenheit(80 Celsius)I'm going to have to hook up an external keyboard if I want to play for any longer than maybe 10 minutes without it being very uncomfortable on my hands.This is all my first time use experience though so I'll have to come back to update this review and let you all know how things go after running this things for a lot longer. :)",0
Very convienient to have a physical Turbo Boost button,0
I was using it for 3 month mostly for work (matlab and 3D rendering).,0
the size was ok but when searching for something it goes back to launche and i have to start all over. take's a long time to get to where i want to go.,0
"Bought this for my son, who plays a lot of games on Steam. It's been great. The fact that it has a graphics card really sold me on this. It's been a great laptop. Well-made and easy to set up. We're all glad with this purchase.",0
"I decided to replace an old windows 8 Dell that finally quit with this Asus. Being familiar with Asus and their tablets I like the brand. I wanted a SSD and reading reviews here I liked that I could add another hard drive as the SSD standard is a M.2. So that leaves a big ol’ slot for a 2.5 SSD (or HD.) Rather than use my old 250gb Samsung SSD because I wanted something new and shiny to go with my shiny new Asus I purchased a new Crucial 500gb 2.5 SSD and a Crucial 500gb M.2 SSD. Both on sale. Why not go all the way!Adding the 2.5” was easy. The only thing is to get the back off remember the screws hidden under the rubber foot pads. (Rear ones only if I remember right, front didn’t have any.) Next I used the software Crucial gives you Acronis to clone the stock M.2 to the new 2.5”. Then I changed the boot order in the BIOS to the 2.5” and swapped the M.2. Next I cloned the 2.5” back to the M.2. Don’t panic Acronis will say it has to restart and it will go into some safe mode looking thing while it clones. That’s it. I prefer the OS to be on the M.2. Maybe that step isn’t necessary? I figured the OS came on the M.2 so why not leave it there. To get windows to see either type “partition” in search and click it. Go through those steps so you see the drive under PC.Very easy to add a HD or swap both. I went to a larger M.2 only because it was on sale. The ONLY thing I don’t like about Crucial is BOTH were made in Mexico. Oh well. The one I replaced in the Asus was Chinese - even worse IMO. All this was very easy to do and if I can do it you can too. I would do a system image and create a restore USB thingy just in case. (Or Microsoft backup disks if you have an external DVD burner.)All in all a nice laptop though all in price wise it wasn’t cheap, but cheaper than anything comparable and Asus gives you a lot of ability to upgrade which I like. It all feels high end though not Apple high end (even with upgrades no Apple high end price.) and is very lightweight. With the upgrades (and even before) I feel like it punches way above its weight class performance wise.",0
"Perfect, good quality",0
"This is the slowest computer I have ever seen. It takes as much as an hour to turn on. I have only done taxes on it and 2 websites for government license renewals, so the memory is nearly empty. Despite this, I could surf the web faster with a pencil and paper. There is also no tech support. Do not waste your money.",0
The only issue is the size of the electric adapter. It is used by my daughter at college.,0
Es hermosa! Compacta y el dise?o es elegante!,0
I really liked this product for its speed and resolution.,0
"I've being using this for a few weeks now and am thrilled with the performance, screen quality and light weight.",0
"No problems, Works as stated!",0
This is a great laptop. Ready to use out of the box. Love it!,0
"The laptop was great until the screen started to flicker and when I used the touch pad it got worse , returned it and I'm waiting for my replacement unit.",0
Got this as a gift. She was happy at first until Windows update could not finish due to not enough space. Needs external hard drive to complete update.,0
I am really happy with my purchase and very impressed. To be fair I cant' rate battery life just yet as I just got it but by every other measure I don't expect to be disappointed. The keyboard feels great. The backlight isn't too obnoxious. The touchpad is appropriately responsive. It has good airflow... which is really important considering most age failures are a result of heat. If I had to say one bad thing it would be the process of registering the product through MSI because their server appears to be down. I'd really like to register this soon.,0
Amazing computer works well for school and is convenient using the touch screen.,0
"I ordered a few days ago, and so far haven't noticed anything wrong, except for the noise. It claims on Amazon that you can change the volume/performance by pressing Fn+F, but I've tried doing so many times, and it does nothing. And from what I've heard it isn't working for anyone else either.",0
"It runs much faster than my old x1 carbon, but it froze several times out of no reason and I also run into the WiFi connection issue in my first week use. But overall, 1k for 4800h+1660ti+16g, what can u ask more from a legion brand, good deal!",0
"Screen looks good, touch-pad nice, a full size laptop at this price",0
"This product is to replace an aging/old laptop. New one is easy to configure, works well and faster.",0
Very good for price,0
"I absolutely love this laptop but I has one problem that is nearly a deal breaker. The screen has these green zones where the plastic bezel is putting a small amount of pressure on the screen because of a wire or something I assume. It's not noticeable during normal use, but when you have a dark scene in a game or movie, you can really tell.",0
Spec'd to have 3200 MHz Ram ... when it actually is locked @ 2666 MHz. That's a big problem.,0
Prompt delivery matching description. Quality keyboard and monitor.,0
"Light weight, great start up speed with SSD drive. Keyboard backlighting good for dim lights but key letters hard to see in medium light. Ability to turn off keyboard backlighting is a plus and actually makes letters easier to see in bright light.",0
Tengo un mes con el equipo y hasta el momento todo excelente sobre todo tomando en cuenta el precio,0
No compren es lo peor que pueden elegir y no de aceptan cambios,0
"I bought this chromebook refurbished four years ago and it still works like the first day I personalized it. I’ve probably run the battery out fifty times (oops) but even so it maintains a solid 4-5 hours of use off the charger. (Used to be 8-9, but four years of mishandling and still keeping a good charge? Kudos to you, Samsung.) It’s my favorite travel laptop — easy keyboard style, and small and light enough to carry in a hiking pack. Drawback: no Microsoft Word compatibility, which has messed up formatting for a few resumes, but the Google Docs option still lets me rattle off my musings and it’s a better backup saver than an external hard drive.What I don’t care for: not compatible with Windows and very limited in download options. I can’t use this for the Apple Play Store or most RPG games. (Also there’s a star rating for touchscreen? There is no touchscreen with this chromebook. Seems a little unfair for a rating expectation.)I enjoy this laptop for the portability and easy connectivity to Wifi. It streams videos in good quality, and no matter how many times I’ve dropped it it’s still reliable. Speakers... not impressed, but the sound quality is great with headphones and it connects to my bluetooth earbuds. Overall a good choice for a portable keyboard.",0
"My deciding factor on getting this laptop was because I read reviews from fairly reputable places sayin the battery for general use would last between 7-9 hours and for intense gaming at most 3 hours. This does not last more than 3.5 hours for regular general use. Other than that, I've not had any issues with lag on gaming (could also be because of my BenQ monitors), and overall I like the computer. I wish there was an option for Windows 10 instead of Windows 11. Overall I'm satisfied, but I had to take away two stars because of the battery.",0
"Fast, light, good battery life. Not using it for big number crunching, but good for small business. I’m not a gamer, so can’t speak to that. However Windows 11 is nice.",0
"This machine is great for almost everything you wanna do, i personally enjoyed that it had an actually good dac on it cause i love listening to music while playing games, it also has probably the best cooling i have seen in a while.Some cons: 1- only one empty sata connection for storage.2- the touch pad buttons are not that great but i mostly use an external mouse.",0
"Couldn't get the sound to work, windows is a pain in the ass.",0
This product is awful! We purchased the original laptop as a gift for our daughter for Christmas 2019. Less than 4 months later it completely crashed with no chance of recovery. We received a replacement laptop from the company 2 weeks ago and it has already crashed. This laptop and or company are awful.,0
"I've decided to buy this ultrabook for my mom because she has back problems and her laptop is rather heavy. So far, I'm the one using it because it's really fast for daily productivity and the battery life is outstanding. If you're not a heavy user, this product does what it promises.The only downside is the speakers, which are relatively low, so I end up pairing it with a Bluetooth speaker when I want to listen to music or watch a film.",0
I didn't like the laid back seller who didn't push on time delivery of the unit. MichaelElectronics Fast Shipping should put their feet where their mouth is. Good only in overprint quick delivery but under deluvers... Bad seller!,0
the CPU drops dramatically when unplugged,0
This computer's screen died after three months.... with no ability to return or fix.,0
"Es una muy buena laptop, en base a lo que trae y lo que cuesta. La recomiendo.",0
"I just received the laptop. Unfortunately, it was defective. There are gaps at the bottom of all round the chassis, and some wires are exposed. The bottom panel of the chassis doesn't seem to be the correct part for the model and small. I just requested a replacement. I hope I can update my review with a better score when I get the replacement,=== Update ===I got a replacement. The new one looks okay. At least, there are no big gaps or exposed wires.",0
Fast and easy to use.,0
"A very okay machine. I bought this laptop for writing and the R and S keys started popping off after one (1) week of daily use. The screen is clear for most web browsing but the text appears blurry when the fonts are small, which is difficult for word processing. Decent battery life, so far. I don’t regret my purchase, but I’ve had to buy some accessories to deal with the shortcomings of this laptop.",0
Love the ease of use.,0
"Muy buena computadora.Aunque tengo varias observaciones que son detalles que podrían influenciar en la compra.El teclado es de Estados Unidos y si quieres que escriba español hay que aprenderse caracteres como la ñ,[], '() .... (Eso aplica para todos los teclados que no están hechos para escribir en español)No tiene un pequeño foco que avise que están activadas o desactivadas las mayúsculas. Puedes poner un sonido cada vez que la actives pero aún así es confuso.Y esto es lo que más me molesta. Los puertos USB y HDMI son demasiado pequeños, tienes que ejercer una fuerza mayor para poder conectar o retirar los cables.",0
"Overall it's pretty solid. I've had this laptop for about 2 months now and don't use it often but when I do it's almost always for gaming. I like the graphics for GTA5, Rocket League, and Fortnite as well as the videos played from my streaming services and external dvd player. What I don't like is the extremely short play time I get from the battery and the fact that this small white line suddenly appeared in the middle of the screen.I thought that perhaps I had accidentally scratched the screen at some point and didn't notice but after turning it off and looking at in the light I know that it's coming from INSIDE the screen not a blemish on the exterior. This makes for a bit of a distraction while watching videos. Wanted to give it a higher rating but I just expected more.*UpdateI changed my rating to 3 stars because, after 9 months of moderate use, I am now getting a ""no bootable device"" error when I turn it on. Tried updating the BIOS settings but it didn't work. Will have to find a repair shop near me.",0
Not very happy that I received a refurbished chrome book. I thoroughly read the description and didn’t see it stated anywhere.,0
Excellent quality of components and construction,0
"Great looking laptop. Soft keyboard. Great screen. The only thing good about the laptop are the aesthetics. I got this laptop to replace the one I have at work which was starting to run extremely slow so I'm expecting it to crash any moment. I wasn't going to put too much $$ into a work laptop but I did expect the basic and good speed. I should have taken heed at the negative reviews regarding the speed of this laptop. One guy said it's like being on dial-up again. He's not that far off. This laptop is incredibly slow. Just typing this review up to this point the keyboard froze twice. $300 is a lot of $$ for a single, slightly middle income person to spend. I should have paid attention to the reviews and spent the extra $100 for a higher quality machine. At least for my hard earned $$ I'd be able to enjoy the experience. Bottom line. Horrible, horrible laptop.",0
"Starts up quick, runs what I need for school effortlessly, and weighs next to nothing.",0
its absolutely confortable to type on and very customazible,0
"Muy buen producto, me sorprendió lo compacta q es para ser una laptop de 15.5 pulgadas, la única pega es su pantalla que según el ángulo de visión pierde calidad",0
"This is a high functioning little laptop. However, in researching this model it stated this was a great model for photo editing. That is not true at all!!!! I am extremely disappointed in this computer. I shot photos in RAW and you can't even get the entire Photoshop display in the window. Nor can you easily move it back and forth. I thought I was having issues with Photoshop because I couldn't get all of the functions to show up. Today (after 4 months of playing with it) I discovered that it wasn't Photoshop but my computer that didn't show all the panels of photoshop. There aren't enough ports on the computer for downloading photos are working with the photos. I called Dell and asked which monitor and docking station was recommended for this computer. You can't use the monitor without the docking station. The docking station they recommended only makes the computer jam. So basically the only reason for my purchase is a complete bust. I have a $1700 dust collector. I thought Dell was the best, this frustrating experience has proven otherwise.",0
I got this laptop to replace my lenono ideapad s145-15iwl. Now I've only had this for a week but it's been so much better than my last laptop. I can do my school and craft business with no problems.,0
"Computer is fine but it is a challenge to have anything on it because of its small hard drive space. In fact windows is completely unable to update at this point if you have anything more than a web browser on it. It has 64GB of space on it, 32 GB (and growing) is used by windows, and another 8-16 GB of that is used by windows updates. Only buy if you are desperate or are in need of an oversized web browser.",0
"Setup on this computer took less than 3 minutes. Super easy. I was a little nervous because the documentation that came with the computer was minimal - but that's all you need! I have a Windows background, but so far so good. Boot time and shut down is quick! I had some experience with Google Drive so all my documents and spreadsheets automatically showed up since they are in the cloud. The battery seems to hold a charge and for a 11.6"" computer, the keyboard is actually easy to type on. I do believe I'm hooked on the Chromebook.",0
