"What I don't like is that every few months there's an update which crashes my computer. Up until now I fixed it with recover. At this point, 6 months in, it is totally crashed with a stop code. I'm trying to get support but the serial number are these tiny numbers on the motherboard which don't distinguish between 0 and 0. I am so disappointed in this product!",0
I am not sure about gaming. We are just using it for school,0
the fans do get loud on turbo mode,0
"had this laptop for around 3 weeks now and it is running very well. almost every game I have runs extremely fast. definitely recommended.pros:- i7-10th gen processor and a full RTX 2070 GPU- 144hz display- great keyboard- very sturdy- comes with a program that monitors the laptop and allows you to overclock- can change to a battery ""eco"" mode in the built-in program that prolongs the battery life greatly (game performance is really bad while in this mode though, so its only good for light work)cons:- battery drains really quickly while gaming- fans can be loud but this is the case for all laptops around this price range- mediocre speakers",0
"Customer Service is to be commended , they immediately reached out to me via email to notify me of their free offer of a laptop bag.",0
"Product is defective and seller refuses to do anything because we missed the return window by TWO DAYS. Chrome book will not charge and just says “calculating” in battery bar. We received the item Mid July, but admittedly didn’t even open the box until last week because it was to be used only for virtual homeschool. That started Monday morning and by Tuesday morning the thing was dead as a door knob. I essentially bought a over priced paper weight for my child. I reached out to the seller myself AND asked Amazon to step in and help and the seller is still refusing to do anything. During a pandemic, when lots of families are having to shell out funds they don’t have for devices like this. Shame on this company!!!",0
"Excelente inversión, una maquina formidable, es muy rápida, la recomiendo encarecidamente.",0
"not sure if this specific laptop was a lemon, or the model has general issues, but after having owned about 20 computers and laptops, this has been the only one that didn't even make it to 3-4 years and when it broke the cost to fix it was about $400 which is certainly not worth it. Tried to work with amazon and the seller but go the run around. terrible purchase and experience for me on this one.",0
"Loved the price.Battery life is very good. Also charges very quickly.It does everything I needed, I basically just wanted a web browser bigger than my phone with a physical keyboard. Using the chromeOS takes some getting used to but it’s simple really.It is lightweight.The screen and speakers seem like where they built to a price point. The colors of the screen are not vibrant and it definitely helps me see why Apple is so fond of their Retina display. The speakers sound tinny, no bass at all.Still, great value.",0
"Computer is fine for what I use it for, just browsing the web but the volume is very low even with headphones",0
It was a great laptop for the money. I had an apple before. It wasn’t good as the Apple air. But it cost about 1/5 the price. Darn good deal,0
"User friendly right out of the box. It's super fast from start up to shut down. It's my go-to when I don't want to fire up the laptop but want something better than my phone. The battery life is incredible. Since I use Google apps for many things, this is ideal for me. Glad I got it.",0
Excellent machine. My biggest concern was it folding flat so I could watch stuff while on my treadmill. Works great!,0
"Overall is a good computer and works well, the screen looks great, it feels light and sturdy. The only problem I have is the retro-illuminated keyboard that the description says this computer has. There's no retro-illuminated keyboard on this laptop. I reached to Amazon Customer Service and they said There's nothing they can do (How about changing the product description?? And offer a discount on the price I paid for this?) This has been a really disappointing experience dealing with Amazon Customer service",0
"We bought this for our 10 year old son who goes to a virtual public charter school. It has been perfect. The Windows Ink is one of my favorite features. He can write on pdf's right on the screen, print, and put it in his notebook. It's fast and, so far, I have had no issues with it.",0
I bought this product almost 9 months ago and suddenly it stopped working when I contacted Acer support they refused to fix it for me within product warranty and they have the worst customer support ever.they asked me to pay for a new motherboard which will cost me near the device price now.do not buy anything from them the quality of their products is very bad and they are not helping you with their warranty and their after-sales service is very poor.,0
This chrome book cannot connect to the internet from my basement. My HP laptop does fine. Disappointed by this. Cannot really comment on anything else since I have not used that much because of this lack of connection power.,0
When gaming CPU would reach +100°C and the game would hit one digit FPS for few seconds.,0
"The mouse pad is absolute garbage, some parts it goes very deep into the frame if you press with a small degree of force, other areas of the pad resist the pressure.",0
"whenever you try to pick it up, there us a creaking sound of some kind",0
This product has worked quite fine and i would recommend it to others.,0
Screen itself is nice and sharp and does run at 120hz.,0
Muy liviana,0
Graphics are crappy in me office. Laggy scrolling. Excel graphics Grey out. Locks up. My IT guys tries a fresh reinstall update drivers. Bios. Everything. Either I got a bad one or this is not good for me office. Would love it if it wasn’t so slow.,0
The setup was actually pretty easy.,0
"Llego hasta las puertas de mi caso en un estado excelente como si lo hubiera comprado en una tienda, vino sellada, es parecida es l software y su arreglo a las otras Mac igual de organizadas, trabaja bastante rápido, pero hay que reconocer que la calidad de la cámara es menor que las generaciones anteriores.",0
"We opened it up to install RAM (it runs happily with 40 gigabytes!). I have never seen a cleaner, more straightforward design. Truly elegant, complete with a way to replace a range of components (including the battery). The machine works flawlessly - powerful, fast, and capable. I supplemented it with an external keyboard (I like more throw), a good stand, and it also drives external monitors.",0
"The product arrived in perfect aesthetic condition but when i got to finally use it, the right speaker has a distorcion when punch it above 80 in the volume level, i mean its not a deal breaker but a mention of it in the description whould be nice, other than that its the best electronics purchase i've ever done, thanks a lot on the great deal Amazon",0
"pros: excellent specifications (powerful processor i7-8750H ,16gb,and 1050 TI) put all together in a lightweight 4k laptop.Best speaker I have ever seen on a laptopThe cooling mechanism is better than other laptops in the same price range.Cons: Crappy camera on such a professional laptop. In online meeting this camera is terrible. Build quality is excellent, but it doesn't match other rivals like Specter or XPS in the same price range. Additionally, battery life will not impress you, in my regular usage (surfing and youtube) I get 5 hours at max.Touch-pad occasionally stops working for a seconds then goes back to normal.",0
"===Updated Review 04/01/2018===My XPS 13 I ordered again came working as expected. Everything from performance to design is very impressive! It is especially excellent for students due to it being incredibly lightweight and it's small design. My back no longer has to be burdened by my thick gaming laptop I used to carry in my backpack. It should also be thin enough to fit many other things (books, folders, etc) in a typical backpack.Several people have already asked me what laptop this is and noted that it is ""the perfect size."" Dell really hit the nail on the head with this one and genuinely surprised me. I look forward to seeing what other innovative products Dell will release in the future.===Old Review===Laptop is Fantastic But...It arrived a little defective. The fan makes an absolutely horrible grinding noise and randomly stops making it over time. After doing a little research online, it appears that this issue is caused by a mis-alignment with the fan installation.I will update my review once this issue is resolved.",0
"Great little computer, I’m impressed.",0
Amazing laptop amazing shipping just 4 days across the globe amazing building quality amazing performance and most of all amazing prices highly recommend you won’t reject itA little bit of screen bleeding but not as much maybe i was lucky with my model as i see others have more screen bleeding cooling is amazing in this laptop even left it run overnight for few days with no problems runs games so amazing and it’s so fast will update if any issue came up it’s been a week of using it hard so far so good so great,0
excellent! lightweight.,0
This laptop runs very well the last PC games but the battery life has a poor performance.,0
I watch videos and movies just fine with this and also the news sites.What I wanted and works just fine for that.,0
This device is the reason that Chromebooks are taking over the world!,0
"As the title states, this is a great laptop. Very responsive and can be used for gaming on video games such as Minecraft. It runs Chrome and Discord very well. Definitely worth the upgrade if your computer is old.",0
:D,0
"Full transparency I have had this laptop a total of 2 1/2 days so time will tell if it continues to be a 5 star laptop. So far I really like this computer, the screen and keyboard are both really great. That said if you are buying this for the built in speakers, look elsewhere they are not very good, just wear headphones... really. Like another reviewer, I have been searching for a few months now for a good value gaming laptop. The fact that this has at 2070 and a 10th gen i7 makes me very happy. I could not find another laptop with these specs at this price.",0
Grandson loves it - uses it at school,0
"Rápida, buenas prestaciones, muy buena evaluación en la relacion calidad-precio, yo la compre en poquito menos de 20,000 mxn por lo cual es la mejor oferta que he encontrado, llego antes de lo previsto.",0
"Good screen. Good processing power. Absolutely useless online. The wifi adapter drops the signal multiple times a day. Even when other devices in the house are online and the Lenovo says I have a connection it will not connect. The only remedy is to stop what I'm doing and reboot...and this does not always work, but sometimes requires 2 or more tries.",0
i love it my dad got it for me im using it now just runs out of charge fast if not connected but other than that its very worth it and runs gta fine if any one was wondering,0
Works great for taking online classes,0
fingerprint recognition to login process,0
Very fast. Keyboard is very sensitive. NO instructions in book form or any other form that I can find!,0
"If there were no underlying issues with this laptop I would rate as 5 Stars and higher recommend. However, having owned this laptop for less than 30 days I've experienced too many issues and am returning for a refund. First and foremost is the random shutdowns that occur without warning or provocation (i.e laptop idle/not overheating), refusing to open desktop applications or games (particularly Steam games), and restart times in excess of 10 minutes when system locks up. What convinced me to return and not purchase another Helios 300 are the number of people on the Acer support forums that have experienced similar issues without resolution. If you purchase and don't experience these issues, congrats on having an amazing gaming laptop that runs games excellently, that hasn't been my experience and must caution: buyer beware.",0
"The laptop's performance was alright, what was expected given the price of the laptop. But the screen showed issues since I first turned it on, it seemed that it was not plugged in correctly or it had gotten loose from the other components. Screen would go black while the system's online and it would need to be restarted multiple times to fix but even so it would not get fixed sometimes. I would say avoid buying ASUS TUF products, their products will work at first but always show problems on the long run and in some cases in the short run as well.",0
I am faced with an extremely unsettling noise most likely coming from the fan.,0
This was a Christmas gift for someone else but so far he is very pleased with it.,0
"Product received ahead of projection, setup went great. The product is working as advertised.",0
Works well for going everyday use bought two and my children play ark survival and serveral other games with no issues as of yet.,0
I use this product for travel and teaching.,0
"Battery doesn’t charge when I’m using the laptop so it’s essentially useless considering it has about an hour worth of battery before dying. Look at reviews on other sites, the battery is a huge issue with this model/brand. I could have bought a regular laptop for 600 and not have ran into these issues.",0
Best gaming laptop for the money. This computer is an amazing value even with GPU prices dropping. This thing is more powerful as most desktops (14 cores!). Still very portable and useable for everyday things like work editing and gaming on the go. The only complaint I have is the battery life. Between the i9 CPU and the 125w 3070ti GPU this thing wont not last long when not plugged in. IMO it also look's a lot better once I had it in person compared to what I was expecting. If I could only have one computer in my life with out spending a ton of money I would hands down pick this laptop. I am very happy with my purchase so far.,0
"I'm no a technician but have purchased enough chromebooks, laptops, etc., to know that equipment that stops working shortly after it is purchase is probably defective. I returned it.",0
Update battery life still sucks but after a fresh install like a previous review said it's running 10x better performance wise unreal engine runs great premiere pro an after effects runs like a beast reason I bout this but also dying light 2 to with raytracing an max settings runs perfect for anyone wondering on the gaming side of course that's all plugged in on battery might not have the same out come if they can get the battery to last 3 hours be perfect for me 1hour 20 mine just not enough,0
I was using it for 3 month mostly for work (matlab and 3D rendering).,0
1. the touch screen is really not necessary. It also can cause additional trouble when you try to connect to another screen. 2. I used it for 6 months and the main screen died for no reason..,0
Had a mini adjustment phase coming from a pc to Mac but its been great thus far and the battery life is incredible,0
"I've had this laptop for about a month. I'm a fairly casual gamer, but this runs World of Warcraft, Planet Zoo with all DLCs and Sims 4 with all expansion/game packs plus tons of custom content without even blinking. I run all these games on the highest graphics settings and have had no issues or lag at all. I also use this for work/other tasks. It does exactly what I need it to do. The battery doesn't last super long without being plugged in, but that doesn't bother me. It also doesn't get super hot when running, and there have been times where I have played WOW for like 8 hours straight. Extremely happy with this purchase. For a gaming laptop around $1000, I HIGHLY recommend!!",0
Laptop works great,0
Didn't really know how different a chromebook was from a regular standard laptop. Does pretty much the same thing. Still getting used to it and how to make it do certain things a regular laptop can do. Slowly figuring it out. Doesn't help I'm not very tech savvy to begin with I guess.,0
"Es la 3 era compra realizada. Es completa para lo necesario, con un diseño elegante y premium. Rendimiento espectacular y sin lags en ofimatica.",0
"Buy at your own risk.Great when it doesn't crash every 2 seconds. (Will have to fiddle with settings, to resolve this!)",0
It freezes when i playing fortine and it’s no even in high grafic. Trash!,0
"Great screen size and quality. Fast loading, super light, and battery life is more than adequate. Bought for coding, lots of tabs open and holds up without lag. Amazing.",0
The design of the keyboard and touchpad are large fit your hands great as well as the keyboard effects.,0
Good Product,0
Prompt shipping. Well packaged. Works as expected. No issues from seller.,0
"It’s okay. Good quality if you’re just using programming like blackboard. But , you can’t save anything and can’t work with word docs",0
The SSD is reporting errors,0
Runs super fast and works great for gaming!,0
I love this laptop. It's great right out the box plays bfV at 120fps average maybe a little higher. Great value got it on sale. The screen is really bright and vivid.,0
La pantalla refleja y cansa usarla de día. La impresión de las teclas no contrasta y cuesta verlas de noche. El bluetooth con frecuencia tiene interferencia entre las bocinas BOSE que no tenía mi DELL anterior. No trae el conector para red alámbrica. Los primeros días estuvo lenta pero ahora ya agarró el paso (?Windows updates?),0
"I've owned two Mac's (one Pro one Air) prior to this one and only purchased a new Mac because my last one was too old and could no longer support Google Chrome, videos, etc. In two months there have been several hairline cracks develop on my screen and the trackpad has cracked without any impact. My previous Macs have been indestructible so this change must be from the new construction. I was told there's no way to prevent the same damage to the trackpad in the future which makes me relatively concerned about ongoing cost if the same problem continues to occur. I would purchase an older, more durable model before this one, or be sure to get AppleCare+ because they aren't quite made to last as they used to be! Without these issues it would be a great computer, it's fast, light, portable, and holds long battery life, but the constant need to get costly repairs just doesn't offset it!",0
Love it!!,0
"I love this computer, it is light and fast. It comes with a big screen, full size key board with a number pad (which I find so much easier for doing bills, only shopping etc).Starts up quick, no issues at all. Everything I need for keeping things going at home!",0
This computer is a lightweight computer. It runs very well. The keyboard is easy to type on. It does not have a VGA port and only has one HDMI port. Very happy with it. Came pre-installed with a bunch of software that took time to delete.,0
"Si bien tiene un precesador decente no lo es tanto para aplicaciones fuertes, puede con ellas, si, pero no es el proposito de este PC, para un estidiante u oficina peque?a si es una buena herramienta, para ver videos no tanto, si pantalla al ser de cristial no permite ver imagenes desde cualquier angulo por lo que si pretenden ver vides en grupo no es la opcion, pero para temas de office o simplemente navegar esta mas que sobrada",0
"I'm very happy that they included an ethernet port, as it allows me to avoid using VPN authentication at work",0
"I love Acer laptops, have owned several since 2004. This one is a huge no-no. The fan is very loud, to the point that you can't really focus on whatever you are doing, and, despite of that, you could feel base overheating after just 1 hour of normal use. Fans are always a problem with Acer, but in this case, it's outrageous. My last Acer buy was a Swift 7 three years ago. I can't believe that this is the opposite of an improvement. The case feels cheap and flimsy, the startup time is pretty slow, and again, the fan is probably the worse I've ever experience with Acer. The Iris Xe is not the best option either. It appears to slow down the performance instead of enhancing it.",0
"Great computer, replaced a very old one that i had, screen quality is clear and crisp. Keyboard feels good. Track pad works perfectly. Build design feels great.Only downside to this computer is the sound, with the volume at 100, its very quiet.",0
"This is an awesome laptop for working and light gaming! A few things that may annoy people: fans do get a bit loud even if if you are not doing heavy stuff like watching Netflix or Twitch, screen is not at best at the light of a sunny day but it's not bad! Overall easily best laptop for the money that you can get in this price range.",0
"Alright, if you had a ratio of performance and price for a gaming PC. This laptop hits the golden ratio. Yes, it is small, but it has an RTX 2070. Yes it has some MSI bloat pre-installed, but it can be removed. I undervolted it with Throttlestop and used the old MSI application ""Silent Option: to minimize fan noise.Even with CPU turbo turned off, and the GPU and CPU undervolted, this thing slays. Like, flight sim 2020 maxed out at consistent 60+ FPS, death stranding maxed at 140+ FPS. It's nuts for the price. This thing is a desktop slayer.I added a TB samsung SSD to the 2.5"" bay for ~70 bucks. 1.5 TB of SSD storage? Get out of town.Biggest cons: speakers suck. Badly. Use headphones if you care about audio at all. Seriously, the audio is BAD. IE my samsung galaxy s7 has better audio quality, not an exaggeration. Battery life is dismal (as expected) think of this piece as a more portable gaming desktop. -- No one expects to game on battery.All in all, this thing slays. I wish the coating was a little more fingerprint proof, but the styling is subtle enough to not scream "" G A M E R - F U E L "" -- and for that I respect it.",0
The form factor of this laptop is absolutely amazing.,0
"Can easily play any game on ultra settings you throw at it and it really isn’t that loud when you’re playing. Only thing is that it eats up battery but since most people are going to use this laptop to game, it’s only customary to keep it plugged in. Although it does have that portability option. For 2k, I’d say if you’re looking to buy this machine go for it. The build quality, aesthetics, and performance are astounding. 11/10-also, It doesn’t have a camera but it isn’t a con for me",0
"I'm a contractor and from time to time I get plans for commercial jobs that are enormous. These would bring my computer to a crawl. Hoping this will have the speed and RAM to power through them. Fan is a bit noisy, but that's probably normal for these ""gaming PCs"".",0
Fantastic display regardless of being 1080p,0
"Screen quality is pretty bad. I guess that is due to the ""non-glare"" feature. Have had trouble with the screen ""jumping"" now that I cannot return this. Also, the battery must be old because it does not stay charged more than a couple hours. I am always recharging. Is not worth what I paid!",0
preformance is good. had some weird screen glitches. battery life is atrocious ive had it for a week. it lasts like 3 hours maybe 4 if i use it straight.,0
"I purchased this to replace my 13 year old Asus laptop which was used for general web surfing, social media, emailing, photo retouching, and Word/powerpoint/excel projects.This HP is everything I needed, and more! Windows 11 is much more user-friendly than Windows 10. The speed at which this machine operates is phenomenal. It starts up quick, and holds a charge for at least 8 hours.Best of all, it's lightweight and thin, so traveling is a breeze.Bonus: it is bluetooth compatible, so I can make/answer phone calls and check my text messages with my phone in the next room.Another bonus: numeric keypad!The only thing that would make this laptop better would be a back-lit keyboard, but I'm not sweating the small stuff.",0
I am in love with this laptop. I'm a student and it works great for projects. I also play world of warcraft and can play with ease with all the settings on high. And the keyboard is super fancy and lights up.,0
"The camera is not really current. Especially for a laptop in this price range. It’s not much, if any, better than the toshiba laptop I got at Walmart for $400 back in like 2010. It is actually fine for me because I don’t rely on it for work or anything. But if you rely on it for virtual meetings, FaceTime, zoom, etc, you will be disappointed in the camera quality. I have very little need for the camera so it doesn’t bother me personally. But the camera is absolutely embarrassing for what has been named the laptop of the year by many, and I would agree, it’s a great computer. Great battery life, super fast charging, very light, not quiet—silent. Quiet implies there is a minimal amount of noise. There is no fan in this and it’s is literally silent. No noise at all, at any level that I can discern. Really fast. Best laptop I’ve ever had for sure.",0
Not only was this delivered to my door without ringing the doorbell or needing a signature and just left for someone to steal it. This trash wouldnt even turn on... Absolutely garbage service from all around and I am appalled I have had service like this.,0
"More than I expected. I bought this because one of the tech guys at my Firm requested that I should get one, considering that I was looking to buy a new laptop. This is my first chromebook and the setup and start up is so quick and easy. Its so much to learn still, but I’m in love with my purchase.",0
"This does exactly what I need, writing on google docs. Fast enough for that and some light browsing. Lightweight but doesn't feel cheap. Only thing is I am not sure if there is a delete key, something I use a lot",0
"I use this computer for Architecture school, and does everything i need, its fast and reliable.",0
"I’ve had the PC for little over a year now and it’s already giving a “No Bootable Device,” error. Before that the PC would get hot fast. The keys turn off in under 30 seconds. I would have thought it’d last at least a few years before I had to get a new one but you get what you paid for. I would recommend purchasing a better PC from different seller and manufacturer.",0
"Buyers beware.. this laptop doesn’t have some features mentioned by the seller. First it’s the processor, only 1.20GHz, then the backlit keyboard. I don’t know which one other people received but mine doesn’t have the backlit keyboard..Update : I reached out to the store and they were really helpful..",0
"Excelente producto y muy bonito color me gustó mucho en especial el teclado Retroiluminado, el portátil rinde perfectamente por los 8Gb de ram y su SSD M.2 recomendado",0
"I don't like long reviews so I'm not going to make this long. I don't have one complaint about this laptop. I bought the 32GB ram, 512GB SSD version. It arrived a day earlier than expected and was packaged carefully so nothing could get damaged. The speakers kinda suck, but I mostly use headphones so I don't even think about it. The keyboard is really nice with the custom lighting and feels great! The battery life is really good as long as you're using the laptop for typing reports, watching youtube videos, browsing the web, etc. The thin bezles make the screen look even better from what it already is. The performance is even better when playing games. I bought an external SSD to put my Steam library on and this beast of a machine plays all of my games no problem at or slightly under 60 fps in 1080p.",0
it can be a little loud when the gpu kicks in,0
"This is amazing laptop that has 16GB of RAM with 512GB of SSD space and Intel Quad-core CPU at unbelievable price. I love the 15.6"" large screen with 1080 HD IPS display that is bright and vibrant in color in many different angles. It also has large battery capacity that allows you to use the laptop for 8 to 10 hours when fully charged. It comes with the latest Microsoft Windows 11 Home edition installed and it will walk you through the setup when you first turn on the laptop. Please note that Windows 11 will force you to login with Microsoft account or you will have to create new account in order to finish the Windows 11 setup but after the setup is finished, you can go to the Control Panel setting to change it to local login if you don't want to log in with Microsoft account like I do. I really hate this feature but this is more of Microsoft Windows 11 feature and nothing to do with this laptop.WHAT I LIKE:[+] 16 GB of RAM, which is amazing and I would never get a laptop with less than 8GB but this one has twice as much memory compared to other similar laptops. More the memory, the faster the speed. It's simple as that.[+] Intel CPU with 4-core for multi-tasking, which also helps with performance along with 16GB memory.[+] 512FB of SSD disk space, which is more than enough for most people and can store massive volume of our family pictures and videos.[+] HDMI port along with Type-C USB port, which allows me to connect to 2 external monitors so I can work with 3 screens in total! This is one of my favorite feature!!![+] Amazing long battery life, good quality webcam, and large touchpad.[+] 15.6"" large screen with 1080 HD resolution and large keyboard with number pad.[+] 2 USB 3.0 ports as well as 1 USB 2.0 port, which is great as some wireless mouse works better with USB 2.0 port for their receiver.[+] Headphone jack, Ethernet port, and microSD card reader.[+] Very slim profile when closed and lightweight for ultra portability.[+] Amazing performance, speed, and value for its price!WHAT I DON'T LIKE:[-] Absolutely nothing.HOW IT CAN BE BETTER:> It would have been awesome if it had a biometric fingerprint reader so quick and secure login but this is not a deal breaker.BOTTOM LINE:I would give 10 out of 5 stars if I can. It's really hard to come by a laptop with 16GB of memory and this kind of specs especially at this price point. Very impressed with this laptop and so much room for even expansions in the future. The Type-C port can also be connected to USB-C hub for additional ports and input/output. Highly recommend this laptop without any reservation.",0
"The thunderbolt port just stopped working one day. Tried reinstalling drivers, resetting bios, did every single thing mentioned online, so I went to them.I have explained this issue, in tremendous detail to Asus a great number of times, and yet, they continually just keep copy/pasting me the same exact recommendations.Military tough? Nope. Usb-c's are sloppy and hell, don't even work. Last time I buy Asus.",0
Still going strong. Fans are loud af when gaming or intense programs are running but all in all a great deal.,0
"Flagship? Really? Edited: DO NOT BUY!!! TOTAL GARBAGE!! I don't really use it too much so it shouldn't be lagging due to hardware wear and tear. Takes forever to boot, even after logging in it takes at least 10 minutes before you can use. I will never buy another hp product again! Windows is garbage but this takes it to a whole new level. If you want to pay over $500 dollars for pure disappointment and frustration buy one of these.",0
Super practica para los Niños,0
"It has been the easiest computer to set up in terms of loading software, etc.",0
"Overall, a very good quality, good looking, and good performance laptop for the price with acceptable fan noise. That said, the 4gb v-ram is the biggest blow to it's performance as some newer you intensive titles struggle at the highest settings. keep in mind that it isn't the most portable and light weight of laptops, making it a bit more difficult for always having it in you bag.",0
"This computer is absolutely stunning! It appears to handle games amazingly well! So far I've had no performance issues. When I first bought the computer, I was worried there would be a lot of bloatware preinstalled onto the computer that might slow it down, or would consume my time hunting down and removing, yet it was not the case! There was few unnecessary programs preinstalled which made setting the laptop up quick and painless. I have not noticed the laptop over heating and it is generally quite quiet. When loading into a level or map on a game, the fans get loud for a few seconds, but that is to be expected. I highly recommend to ANYONE looking to get into gaming, or looking to switch to a gaming laptop. I needed something that would allow me to continue gaming, while also working well for this upcoming year at school, and this looks like it'll be perfect!",0
A little slow. Gets the job done. Nice size for old eyes. Good budget computer for home use.,0
The laptop is pretty good for playing games however the biggest downside to this one is that it gets very hot and you'll notice the heat during long gaming sessions and the fan is VERY loud so wear some headsets because you'll have a hard time hearing the game with the fan blowing and keep it plugged in as the battery life isn't long if left unplugged.,0
"My fan started literally chirping like a bird 5 days after I bought it, and is now screeching weeks later.",0
I had an Acer chromebook for a few years which I loved. It was wonderful. I bought a new one and find that the sound is not loud enough to hear even turned to the highest setting. What a disappointment. Also it is slower than my former chromebook.,0
"The screen clearly had a transparent square burnt into it that would come and go. You could not click on anything under that square when it was visible. I returned it, BUT I WAS NOT REFUNDED MY FULL AMOUNT!",0
Bought this for my daughter. she is under 13 and loves this item. it seems t play the games she wants to play and allows her to do her school work as well I am very happy with the item,0
my internet service is faster and I am always happy to turn it on.,0
the individually-lit keys on the SteelSeries keyboard blink slowly in a splashing pattern that’s beautiful,0

"This is a great gaming laptop that has incredible specs (16gb ram, RTX 2070 & high refresh screen) without having to empty out your wallet completely. I've been able to run a lot of high FPS games so far without issues and can't say enough about how good the games look.Besides your gaming needs, the laptop has the capabilities of doing anything else you normally want from a laptop.However, as with most gaming laptops, if you plan to push the specs to their limits, you probably want to keep the laptop plugged in or the charger close to you.",0
they should remove the numberpad functionality description on this item,0
After 3 months The Wireless connection stopped working. Now I am using a cable connected from the modem .sometimes not even with the cable is working.,0
"Update- 6/11/18He bought an Ipad Pro. The one with the sketchbook at Costco for $700.Main reason, bad battery life with this Lenovo. The 5-6 hours he got testing it in original review was not continuous use.He needed a sketch device for work, on a job site, with no outlet access, and he could not get through a day of plans.It's a shame bc he does miss the ruler on the Lenovo.So I tested it today, as I am tech support in our house.Just did everyday web browsing. Work stuff, news, Bored Panda, and of course, Amazon.He's right. Here's the results.415pm- 100 %520pm-50%602pm- low battery warning at 25%620pm- 11%. I plugged it in.Nothing has been added to the device. It's just as it came out of the box.No apps as the MSN App store has nothing he uses.Also, the screen is not nearly as bright unplugged.Didn't notice until I plugged it back in to charge, which usually means a battery saver is on.But just over 2 hours of use unplugged, in 2018.. well, not very good, is it?If you just want a compact laptop & have electrical access, this has great sketch features.I load my photo & drawing software and see how it fares with those options.But for this price point, sad battery & limited App store, makes it's just ok so, 3 stars. Sorry.Original Review~Everything about this Lenovo is Five Stars, maybe even 6 but... The App Store is MSN which is unequipped with basic apps like MLB.There is a Lenovo App Store which had MLB & gave me hope but, it rolled over to MSN.I will make a tech support call by EOW & if I have success, will update but that is the only reason for 4 stars bc this is a stellar device.This was for him, who travels for work & lost his Ipad so we've been shopping replacement.A new one was on the to do list as he wanted a sketchbook & the Pro was a pricy top contender.The Lenovo Flex excels in so many areas. It's not much thicker than an iPad.The screen quality, definition & color are mind blowing. Better than our fairy new tv.The sound is crystal clear.He's an audiophile, as I think anyone who has played music is, and thought the tunes streaming off YouTube were the stereo.The main need was the sketchbook.He's a carpenter and the ability to sketch out builds, installs & have a 3D bid is priceless.The ability to share, save & copy is seamless with icons on sketch screen.The music note icon in the right corner by the Wi-Fi symbol , instantly gives you access to a blank sketch page, photo sketch & digital post-its.It has a ruler AND a protractor, both adjustable to desired size, plus highlighter & 18 different ink colors & sliding thickness.The ruler moves 360° and slides anywhere on the page with just your fingers. I know the stylus is optional but so far have not found a use for it with this incredibly responsive touch screen.The moment you flip the screen over, an icon pops up to give you option to go into 'Tablet mode'. I like options so, I like that the screen is always touchscreen responsive while having full access to a keyboard.On battery life, it sat for a couple days after a full charge & he was able to use it for 5-6 hours before it hit 20%.It was back at a 100% after just over an hour.I think the quick charge option may have kicked in bc it was at 50% after maybe 20 min.The only downside for him, as he travels is, I haven't found any type of Otterbox protection for screen or device in case it drops but, that's a factor of going with a Flex vs a tablet.Also, Apps work better on the road vs sketchy WiFi so the afore mentioned lacking App Store not having any of his staples is a challenge but that's just our personal experience.If you're looking for a creative, crossover device that will fill a multitude of options from business to pleasure, Lenovo made a believer out of my Apple loyalist.",0
"Runs hot, sound is garbled from time to time, slow (no apps installed, just working within Gmail), and heard me (Cortana) about 50% of the time.",0
"I've now had this laptop for a month, and I am delighted with my purchase. There's a lot about this laptop to love too. It is lightweight, which makes it very portable, so you don't mind taking it with you. The solid aluminum body is strong, although it can flex if you're not careful. The fingerprint scanner works wonderfully. While the specs say the battery can last UP TO 12-hours, my experience has been that it lasts closer to 10-hours, which still isn't bad. The 8th generation i5-8250U processor, 256GB SSD drive, and 8GB of RAM make for a fast user experience. I've had tons of tabs in Google Chrome open, multiple MS Word documents open while streaming music with no problems.While a great laptop, there are a few things I don't like about it. First would have to be the location of the power button, which is next to the 'delete' key. On multiple occasions, I've hit the power button while editing a document. I changed to the power button to put the laptop to sleep when you hit the power button, so I didn't lose any work, but it is still frustrating. My only other complaint so far is that neither the RAM nor the SSD drive is upgradeable. Using an external SSD drive solves the storage issue with negligible performance differences, so that issue has a workaround. As for the 8GB of RAM...",0
We have had this laptop for 32 days and it is hot as a fire on the bottom and will not turn on. Called the acer repair and all they did was create a call back order for a representative to call me back in one or two days to tell me what to do. How's that for service. They did call back. I had to send it in but now it's working fine. They provided mailing label. I changed my review to 4 stars instead of one.,0
I like it a lot. It is very light and fairly fast. It could use a little improvement of a better video card but that is only an issue for gaming and extreme graphics. The delete key position is awkward so I am having a little trouble takes getting the hang of it. Overall the keyboard could use some improvement. All else is fantastic. I am a former 2X Dell XPS 13 user.,0
"It includes so many desirable features, including a wonderful back lit keyboard.",0
"Been using heavily for a month now. Great processor, probably more than you need for a chromebook. Looks and feels Great. Highly recommended.",0
A los cinco meses de uso dejó de prender la pantalla y me dijeron que se da?o la Mother board. Refieren que lo mejor es que cambie el equipo ya que la reparación no es posible :(,0
"After only 7 months using this laptop, the charger cord failed. I have been trying to replace the cord to actually see if that's why the laptop won't respond to charging and have had absolutely no assistance from Amazon, or ASUS. My advice, DON'T BUY ASUS PRODUCTS. Don't buy any computers, etc. from Amazon. Go to your local dealers where you can walk in and deal with a human being. It may cost a few bucks more, but in the end, you will be getting your money's worth. I now have a $380 laptop that is useless to me. I'm going to continue to visit different computer repair shops in an attempt to find out if in fact, it is the charger cord, but take my advice and DO NOT BUY COMPUTERS FROM AMAZON!UPDATE: I did find a cord and have been using the laptop, but now I have a new problem! I can't access the internet! It's probably something I'm not doing, but I'm 81 and modern technology is difficult for us old people. So if you don't have someone living with you that can help you with stuff, DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP NO MATTER HOW INEXPENSIVE (CHEAP) IT IS!",0
nice computer for most anyone only thing didn't know you cant download anti virus,0
I had a problem with the shipping as they sent the wrong product,0
"Pretty great office/productivity PC, be aware of sales because I got it for a great price and then it went up. I would highly recommend getting the base storage version and upgrading the SSD if you have the technical ability, you can save hundreds that way.Overall great ventilation, build quality, weight, battery.Cons:Definitely the screen was a let down, the viewing angles are terrible you pretty much need to directly look at it. But if that’s the only sacrifice they made to get to this price point, I think it’s worth it.",0
It’s been a pretty good laptop for gaming. So if you want a gaming laptop instead of a whole pc this is a good choice.,0
"Been with this laptop for the past three months or so and it’s been nothing but great so far. Triple A games like Modern Warfare, Warzone, GTA V, etc are easily handleable by this laptop and gameplay is very smooth. For the price, it’s a good starter.",0
"First review I have ever written. Two years after purchasing this, the computer died and needs a new motherboard. The repair cost is more than half the original purchase price. BUY THE PROTECTION PLAN. Seems to be a common problem for the this computer based on the Dell support pages.",0
The laptop was smaller than the size advertised,0
"It is a really good looking laptop, the I/O at the back makes cable management when 'docked' very easy.It has great performance, especially in multithreaded applications, if you have an extra buck or two rather go for the 3060 variant, for mainly the more vram, that was unfortunately not in my budget. Still I am very happy with the performance.The screen is absolutely brilliant. It the ufo ghosting test it makes my separate display look like trash. It has vibrant colours, high brightness, the high refresh rate is wonderful.The keyboard is very nice and the only complaint I have for the trackpad is that is could have been a little bit bigger, however with this type of laptop, one usually uses it with a mouse, but something to keep in mind.The cooling fans can get quite loud, but is is more of a whoosh sound than a whiny sound, so it is not really irritating, however if you are buying a gaming laptop, you are probably not buying it for being quiet. When doing lighter tasks like web browsing and using office applications, on the auto power setting, it is quiet 90% of the time, it only gets loud when doing heavy tasks, and then it is in performance mode. Quiet mode is always deathly quiet.The battery is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, keep in mind this is in quiet mode, using the internal gpu, lower brightness and only web browsing, office and reading PDFs, but I have gotten 5-6 hours out of this machine which is actually what they advertised, which is nice to see, usually the advertised numbers for battery is impossible to obtain, so I am happy to see that it is accurate. I have not checked at what framerate the monitor runs in the lower power mode, but since the only predefined option is 165 I presume it runs at 165, so by creating a lower refresh rate setting manually, it could improve battery life even more.Speakers are meh, but it is laptop speakers, so I was not expecting anything fancy, if you have money for this just use headphones or earphones if you are doing anything where sound quality is important, or you care about bass.",0
It’s an ok laptop,0
the display is crisp and the colors are vibrant.,0
I love and enjoy it,0
"I was able to get 150fps+ on medium settings consistently in Valorant, Overwatch, and COD Modern Warfare, which was a huge upgrade from my old 60 fps laptop. Noise and temperature have not been an issue except when running on the highest settings for a long time. Only negative is battery life, which isn't great, but my laptop is almost always plugged in anyway so it hasn't been much of a problem for me. Overall, great purchase for the money and would highly recommend for someone looking for an upgrade.",0
"This computer is used daily for a teen for looking things up, videos, and google searches.",0
Such a high quality and well-built piece of computing equipment. The M1 processor is a huge leap forward.,0
"So glad I went with Acer again. Everything I loved about my Nitro 5 has been made even better, including better build quality, plus much better cooling ability. It's perfect ?",0
"I wrote a review a while ago. Wanted to update it with my current situation.This is overall a good laptop for the price. Out of the box, 8 GB of ram isn't enough though.I went out and bought a dual channel 32gb ram, made things a lot smoother.Most games can run on medium to high settings with playable FPS.Mount and Blade 2 runs about 110 FPS on high settings, but during seiges the FPS can drop to about 50 FPS. (Before the dual channel ram seiges were at lows of 14 FPS, but I think that was an early release bug that was fixed in the game)GTA V runs almost always 60+ FPS om highest settings. No lag issues. (Before dual channel ram it was like 50 FPS on highest settings)War Thunder lits between 110-140 FPS oh high settings. (90 FPS before dual channel ram)My point is, get dual channel ram. It helps a lot.I haven't tested very many tripple A games yet. Gotta buy them first before i try them.512 GB of memory is a bit low for me. I like to have multiple games downloaded so i can pick from a good selection. But, the solid state drive is fast and does it's job.Laptop does get hot when gaming for long periods of time. I'd recommend a laptop cooling pad if your gaming for more than an hour. Fan also gets very loud when on Turbo mode, but if you have a headset you don't notice.RGB is nice. Screen is crisp. Keyboard feels nice. Laptop camera does its job.I do recommend this laptop, just get dual channel ram and maybe a laptop cooling pad.",0
Nice little laptop with decent sound.,0
Nothing to dislike about this computer. I am not a gamer. Had a 17 in 5 yr old Toshiba that was slowing down. This computer is so much fun. Takes only about 5 seconds to boot up. Used to wait 5 minutes. Very light and not a pain to pick up as most laptops are. Can handle the 5-G Wi-Fi technology and that may be why I now get 200+ internet speed when I was lucky to get 20 on the old laptop. SSD drive hardly ever heats up and when the fan does come on you can barely hear it. Well worth the extra money. Listed for $1999 but got it for $1399 on Cyber Monday. What a steal!,0
"I needed a laptop for work in order to store documents, process receipts and email with clients and work colleagues. I didn't have the budget for a brand new laptop and this HP device really solved the problem without breaking the bank. The hard drive has more than enough space for everything I need to store and the processing speed, while a little slow at times, is sufficient for me to get my work quickly and with little fuss. I haven't bought a refurbished laptop before, but this experience has shown me such products can be valuable and worth the risk",0
Home us going on line just general,0
I use this puppy for some cpu intensive music production and it handles it like a champ. Just make sure it's plugged in when putting it through its steps. It drains pretty fast but that's to be expected.,0
"UPDATE:: Here we are, over 3 years later and this is still the best laptop I have ever owned. The battery is still solid. No defects or failures in any of the hardware. Works with latest drivers without incident. And, I just noticed last night, the speaker system is still quite impressive even by today's standards.Asus, if you're listening; sell me a new version in a 17"" form factor with 10th gen tech, RAID NVMe, and none of that ""screen pad"" nonsense. Take my money!::ENDUPDATE: After using this laptop for well over a year as my primary dev workstation and gaming device, I can confirm this is very solid. I built an eGPU rig (HP Omen Accelerator/GTX 1070ti) and they work very well together (since the drivers from ~8 months ago). I can play Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 4k, medium settings at ~30-60 fps. 1080p at Max settings is stable at 60+ fps. Most other new games perform similarly.::ENDI have been researching and waiting for a device like this for a long time. The goal was a laptop that could handle heavy software development, medium gaming, has Thunderbolt 3, less than 5 lbs, and gets great battery life. This laptop has/does it all with ease. My primary focus was a solid CPU and decent monitor as my primary use case is software development. I have a MacBook Pro (Late 2016) provided by my job. While it has good CPU power, it's drivers are way behind and do not support everything Windows 10 has to offer. This ASUS has support for all Windows 10 features; specifically, I am interested in the PTP capabilities for easy multi-desktop work. It also is a nice weight at just over 4lbs. There are plenty of reviews out there, so I'll just touch on the differences I count important. The nVidia 1050 Ti GPU is a very nice value add to this already inspired laptop. I can play Portal 2 and Portal Stories with the FPS capped at 60 and the GPU usage averages 38%. I have also tested it's connectivity over its HDMI and USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort and everything works well. My secondary goal was decent mobile gaming with the option dock into an eGPU over Thunderbolt 3. While I have not tested this yet, it has the necessary ports and specs. I will update when I have the full rig built. There is currently (as of v388.13) a bug in the nVidia GPU driver that causes unacceptably high CPU and GPU clock at idle (desktop, no application running). My solution has been to disable the nVidia GPU in Device Manager when I'm not using it. Contrary to some reviews, I like the keyboard on this laptop. Yes, the keys have a bit more travel that other premium options. And yes, they are a bit softer than some. But, I like it this way. They are still fast and responsive. I cannot give this laptop that last start for the following reasons: There is not option, in North America, that I can find to get one without the touchscreen. I don't like them, I don't use them, and I don't want to pay for it. Next, it will not charge off the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports. I understand the power requirements of this device *can* go above the 100w provided by the spec. But, it should be allowed as an option given the user acknowledging the limitations. I say it *can* go above 100w but I have never seen it get even close in all my tests. That's about it. Everything else is great. I consider the ASUS ZenBook Pro, the MacBook Pro for those who want Windows for far less expense.",0
The chromebook arrived without a power cord for the charger. Vendor must not have a very good quality control program since this is basic to the operation of the chromebook. This also indicates that this is not a new unit since Dell would not have omitted the power cord.Amazon support provided a credit to cover the cost for a replacement charger.,0
The computer does not recognize Wi-Fi so you can’t go online at all. Hp had me reset some things that were supposed to fix the problem but ever time I try to get online this happens again. Obviously the computer is defective. Trying to reach someone at HP but no luck. Don’t waste your money! This is a scam and I will be reporting this!!!,0
"This laptop worked like a charm for the first 4 months of it's life. After then however, I started to see many defects. The graphics card would intermittently make the screen flash a white screen whenever a game loaded up. Also, the keyboard and touch-pad are almost completely useless. A few buttons on the keyboard are either extremely unresponsive or don't pick up on any input whatsoever. As well as the touch-pad which suddenly stopped working all together. I have tried removing/reinstalling the drivers for these hardware pieces but still the same result. Seems to me that MSI is not the best company for quality as of late. I recently purchased 2 of ""MSI VR Ready Vortex G65VR-096 Compact Powerhouse Gaming Desktop Geforce GTX 1070 i7-6700K 32GB 256GB SSD + 1TB Windows 10"" and the graphics card on that system was defective and had to return them. I purchased some Alienware towers instead, might do replace this door stopper.",0
"C'est un bel ordinateur plus lourd que prévu. J'attends encore de voir les performances en utilisant des logiciels d'archi....Pour le reste belles finitions et belles interfaces graphiques.Les couleurs sont vives et belles.Dommage que l'écran ne se d'exploit pas à 360 comme dit sur l'annonce.Aussi un peu déçu, en espérant que la puissance de calculs soit au rdv.",0
This is the second one of these we have purchased. We loved the first one so much we replaced our HP laptop with this.,0
"I am not a tech guy but this is a much better computer than my old one.I generally use my computers for email, surfing the web, zoom meetings and school.This Acer computer has performed beyond my expectations.The wifi connection is quick, applications always open fast.I really like the lit keyboard for working in darker areas.The finger scanner is great for security, works perfectly.The body is made of metal not plastic like my old computer, the hinges aresolid.The screen is fairly good looking, colors are bright and no problems with dead pixels.I am not a fan of the windows operating software as I have used Apple in the past and really like it a-lot.As usual with windows this computer comes with bloat items that I have no interest in using.The speakers are not great if you are wanting flawless sound from music or movies but that is to beexpected from a pc is this price range.This swift 3 is very light and easy to carry around the house or take on the go.",0
the touch screen is very convenient for me to switch it from a personal pc to a tablet.,0
"So don't expect it to run Games at 60fps and such. This laptop is nice and small to carry everyday to work for some small presentations and school work. Wife is a nursing student and her last Asus dropped and broke. So we decided to get this one and it works great for her needs and exceeds for that purpose.As long as it last a couple of years, its money well spent for me.",0
"I use this laptop for coding and development, installed Virtual box, Linux, Oracle DB. Pros: The system is light, pretty fast because of SSD, good battery backup of 5-6 hours at least, no heating problem, very silent and keyboard layout is spacious. Cons: The cooling fan ventilation is in the front below the keypad so cant be sure if its blocked or open; the up, down... keys are not standard layout so having a hard time finding them. I bought it in Feb 2019 for 1,032 AUD and now its price increased. There is a newer more popular model S15.",0
"Muy buen computador. Sí bien es del clásico plástico, no molesta. Al tener SSD enciende rápido, posee la opción de mejorar los vendedores con un software parecido a una tormesa. Eché de menos un lector de huellas que en equipos muchos mas antiguos tenía por defecto. El equipo es pesado. A una mujer no le gustaría. Puedes ampliar la Ram y la memoria interna. Para lo que hablan espa?ol no viene con la tecla ?, pero es solucionable.En resumen con todo en general si lo recomiendo, además de estar muy barato para ser nuevo y sellado. Comprenlo sin problema. A mi me llego en menos de una semana a Chile y la suerte de no pagar aduana. ?",0
"This is my 4th Mac laptop, the earlier ones were all MacBook Pros. I was reticent about getting an Air, but with the M1 chip, this thing is a superb replacement. So small & light, yet speedy. Only drawback is the fixed 8GB RAM complement. I take care not to send the thing into swap- suspending old browser tabs is essential.",0
The Computer Arrived destroyed; Amazon is not accepting calls; company's phone number is bogus,0
"I have used it for almost 1 month, it has worked very well for games, design and occasionally I have used it for mining.Although I have seen complaints about the control software it has, personally it has worked very well for me.It has a very good screen, and the overall design of the laptop is quite elegant.",0
"This laptop is great. It came exactly as advertised. It came with a little under 500GB because windows 10 pro was installed. Its fast, came clean with a good working charger. It was clean and runs super fast. If your looking for a good laptop this is the one. Everything was exactly as described.",0
Laptop is solid. Just don’t expect any sort of help from Amazon customer service. They’re all garbage people.,0
Don't ever buy ASUS in the US. There is no support or replacement parts available. If you need technical support you have to ship your laptop to Atlanta and wait weeks for a response.,0
"First of all, this laptops is beautiful. It is the perfect size, and very light. The battery is what I was mainly concerned with when i was looking for a new laptop. I wanted one that lasted about 8 hours. This battery does last as long as it advertises. About 8 hours. You would need to put on the Power Saver and Battery Saver options tho, if not it will last about 6 hours. It can even last longer that 8 hours depending on what it is you are doing. The battery estimator is off most of the time though, but I have read that it changes mainly based on what your are doing on your laptop and how much power it takes up.I've had it for less than a week, and my only issue is that it has a piece of chipped off paint in the corner inside of the laptop. I just feel that for paying what I paid, it should come to me in perfect condition. I can only assume that the person that was handling and packing my laptop was careless. I am kind of OCD with my things, so this greatly bothers me. I'm not sure if there is anything that could be done for this.I will update my review once I've had my laptop for longer.Update:I’ve had my laptop now for 2 years. The long battery life lasted only a few months after purchasing it. Then the battery started only lasting about 4 hours. The laptop still runs just as smoothly as day one. The worse of it is the battery life, and that really sucks because I had originally bought this laptop because of it being shown as lasting 8 hours.",0
"The model I bought has the most amount of RAM available and combine that with the video card, this is this best one on the market",0
It doesn't overheat the keyboard like other gaming laptops.,0
Bought this laptop for my mother and she loves it. It’s thin and perfect size for plane rides and traveling transportations. Also the screen display is great. Not a touch screen laptop which is a plus for her. Good laptop!,0
I had to send the computer in to ASUS and they had to replace the harddrive. They did not update the warranty from time of repair.,0
"It was like new, 100% satisfied and so is my daughter who uses it for school.",0
"Esta Mac fue un regalo a mi madre y por velocidad, calidad de video y sobretodo por su dise?o compacto y ergonómico le encanta llevarla a todos lados",0
"Been using this computer for a year now and it has been great. Fast and thin. There isn't anything I dislike with this computer. At the front of the computer, it's about 8 quarters thick",0
Got this for my grand daughter for Christmas. Helped her in school.,0
"My deciding factor on getting this laptop was because I read reviews from fairly reputable places sayin the battery for general use would last between 7-9 hours and for intense gaming at most 3 hours. This does not last more than 3.5 hours for regular general use. Other than that, I've not had any issues with lag on gaming (could also be because of my BenQ monitors), and overall I like the computer. I wish there was an option for Windows 10 instead of Windows 11. Overall I'm satisfied, but I had to take away two stars because of the battery.",0
"Received laptop in great condition. Was advertised as RAM having an XMP of 2933Mhz. XMP arrived set to 3200Mhz stable. Yes the 10875h does run a little warm, but with access to fan control software and proper curve set, I rarely reach 75 C in AAA titles set at ultra. Display is great and easily running 144hz in games that allow 144hz. Laptop also has 2 nvme m.2 slots and a 2.5 inch laptop bay drive. The battery is small, but I am always plugged into an outlet, wether that be at home or you into the inverter in my work truck. Overall I am happy with this laptop as it outperforms my HP Omen 15t i7 8750h w/1060 Max Q and doesn’t get as hot.",0
There is no touch screen on this model- not an issue did not expect it,0
"This is a nice looking computer, burn I strongly believe I was sold a used computer that was supposed to be NEW there was someone’s name still registered, as well as their browsing history.Whomever had it didn’t wipe it clean. The seller stand by saying it is new,and did not respond d to my last email.Buyer beware!",0
here's slight foam padding around the bezel to prevent slamming shut when closing the lid. Closes with a soft thump.,0
I'm impressed! Excellent product. Screen resolution is way better than anticipated and computer speed is tremendously fast! Great job Amazon team recommending this unit... I'm 100% pleased!,0

"My husband got me this as a gift months ago. I love it. It's perfect, no complaints. The iridescent color is gorgeous.",0
My only complaint with this 15.6 inch HP laptop is that the letters and numbers on the keyboard are very difficult to read. I had to buy a keyboard cover with black letters and numbers so I could read the keys.,0
"That is good thing, but too cheap inside (One memory slot, minimal capacity of HDD without ports to extend )",0
"I installed Ubuntu 16 LTS on it and worked well. I decided to stick with Linux Elementary OS based on Ubuntu 16 LTS. So, hardware on it works well with Linux.It comes with windows, but if you want to keep the space of SSD to yourself and not to crap windows installs, then Linux would work well.I don't even have swap file defined, because 8GB of RAM is plenty for basic work. Usually memory is used at 31% level. Chrome is at 2GB currently and I am at 50% utilization.",0
"I am writing this amendment to my review on my older laptop, which the Predator was supposed to replace. Why is this? Well, let's follow the timeline.UPDATES3 months: Computer is running excessively hot, to the point where it caused blisters on my right pinky finger because it's a slow heat and I didn't know it was burning me. The SSD C drive complained of critical failure every time the temperature hit a peak, and I had to start shutting it down every 45 minutes. Even using a cooling fan base did not cool it off.4 months: Computer randomly shutting off some programs, like the caps lock indicator I need, and turning others back on, like Cortana. Getting random lag all over. No programs running. It was ultimately found to be the overclocking and heat. Couldn't shut overclocking off.7 months: Reset to factory because of corrupted files; unknown cause. No biggie, I keep everything on a separate, removable drive so I can reset without losing anything even if I wipe the C drive. Everything worked fine after that. Overclocking and overheating remained hyperactive--that is not supposed to happen with a factory reset. Was this thing programmed to kill itself?8 months: The keyboard is acting up even worse than before with typing in multiple letters. Heat is peaking at the highest it's been and I can only be on it for 5 minutes before it needs a break. This was just having it on. I wasn't running any programs and did not have it plugged in, which makes it get hotter even faster. I let it sit for 5 minutes, doing nothing, and it was whirring like a jetliner having a heart attack despite Task Manager showing no active programs running. Only overclocking was running and I couldn't shut it off, as usual.1 year, 1 month; warranty barely expired: One day, after I'd fallen asleep at the Acer, I woke to find it unresponsive. Hit the power button. Nothing. Panic began to set in. Removed the bottom cover and disconnected the battery so I could allow it to sit for 30 mins. Turned it on. Predator sound and logo spread across the screen. Whew. Problem averted. Got to the login screen, then the computer just shut itself off. Never mind, problem not averted. Tried it again, then again, then again. I was in a serious panic at this point. After 10 times I went back and read the 1-star reviews. This is a rectangular coaster, unworthy of anyone's money. I should have returned this after getting a second dud--first with a broken pixel and second with an overactive keyboard input (inserting multiples of one letter press). The majority of the 5-star reviews are fake, while the 1- and 2-star and some 3-star ones are authentic. Read the 1-star if you want a good feel for this laptop's performance.In the pits of despair and having no access to my work documents, I suddenly remembered my old Asus. My ancient potato of a laptop. I went over and grabbed it from its dusty grave, then revived it, started it up with my drives from the Acer activated as my boot drive, and retrieved some info I hadn't managed to save. I love this Asus. And now I am writing this review amendment on it.Why am I being so scathing instead of polite? Well, I tried to contact Acer support multiple times. Four times, the contact just hung the call up without responding. Three times I just got hung up on for no apparent reason while trying to see if the laptop could be repaired. And once, I got a really rude, ill-tempered person who sounded more accusing than helpful. The worst part was sifting through people I could barely understand. Never again. I will not ever purchase another Acer product. They can shove it and I hope they bury themselves. Nothing from Acer has ever worked for me, but because of the cool-looking new laptop and 5-star reviews, I was duped into thinking they'd improved their shoddy, cheap trash.Shame on me.My amendment would not be so harsh had I received quality customer support.Or a functional computer.That thing is not worthy of existing. Shame it looks so fantastic. That's the only good thing about it.....ORIGINAL REVIEWFor the price, this is an absolutely fantastic piece of gaming equipment! I had to exchange the first one because there was a broken pixel which would catch things above its designated area, causing a strobe effect when moving over certain terrain. Second laptop had no defects.Whhy four stars? Well, do you see that double ""h""? That's why. I have looked for a solution to this problem. Reinstalled drivers, changed key press sensitivity, changed the hoold down sensitivity, everything suggested across multiple forums. I was told it was me, at one point. I've never run into this issue in my life. It's not all the time, but as a writer, it's a noticeable nuiisance. I have to go back and correct a lot of my typing because of it. I lightly tap a key and it stamps an extra in there for no reason, sometimes even doing a triple letter. I can only conclude it may be the laptop, itself. I don't know, because I cannot get an answer.Other than that little problem, it handles even the heaviest GPU/CPU-consuming games I have, and it handles Photoshop and other rendering services magnificently. (I started editing my post at this point because it just gets ridiculous.) Games run so smoothly that it's changed them all in my opinion.",0
the screen takes up pretty much the entire foldable half of the laptop with less than a centimeter of bordering chasis.,0
Like it - disadvantage - buy and spend time for installation of the windows 10 pro.,0
The battery life is more than satisfactory and lasts for several hours doing productivity tasks/Web browsing without video.,0
"Bueno, en General es la primera vez que uso Amazon, Me pareció que fue un envió rápido ya que decia que llegaba el 19 de enero y llego el 13 del presente mes, el equipo llego correctamente embalado y empacado.Es un Portátil nuevo tal como se describe con el vendedor. Su comportamiento de respuesta es alto va muy bien fluido, hasta ahora no he instalado ningún juego. trae un SSD marca SK Hynix (Hyundai) de 512GB no es el mas rápido del mercado incluso es mas rápido el Samsung evo.Visualmente el equipo se ve muy bien hecho se ve solido. Trae un cargador de 230W y su cable de alimentación es largo. En cuanto su pantalla es de buena iluminación y nitidez esta pantalla es de 144hz IPS da muy bueno colores en las imágenes, su sonido no es malo pero podría ser mejor pero para mi suena bien.Batería: Por ahora solo veo que da un rendimiento de 4 Horas 30 Minutos, personalmente creo que se queda un poco corto con su rendimiento de batería, pero pues nunca había tenido un PC Gaming, no se si este entre la media. Batería es de 60Wh con el tiempo pensaría en cambiarla por la de 80Wh. Teclado Retroiluminado color Blanco, se siente bien al tacto. No siento que el equipo se caliente con un uso general, falta probar jugando en todo su desempe?o, creo que tiene muy buena refrigeración.Seguiré usando y con el transcurrir de los días daré nuevas opiniones.",0
I am now a Chromeo this OS integrates seamlessly with my smartphone it has made my PC a large paperweight.,0
"it arrives in a sleek, black box with a beautiful photo of the laptop on its cover",0
Here's what I like-Keyboard-Frame / Bottom / Lid-Size-Came with a zip up sleeveI'm able to do my gaming on the go with this. It has the ports I need and have not had the other issues people are sharing. I am using it with a laptop cooler I bought however.Things I don't like-Backlight bleeding in a few spots-Shipped with LOTS of bloatwareI was able to fix most the issues I had by just blowing away the operating system and re-installing a fresh OS with no bloatware.,0
"It's smaller than my last one, so it fits my cooling board. I love that the keyboard can change color. The screen has no glare which is amazing. Never had a laptop that didn't have glare. My games look fantastic, it's almost like starting a new game. I haven't done a lot with is yet, but its worth the money. Very happy I didn't go with the other laptops I was looking at. This is by far the best one I have owned. I love how loud it can get. My last laptop even with the sound all the way up I can't hear the games or shows. Very happy with this laptop. It loads things very fast which is nice. It's much lighter than my last one, so it's easier to move around. Not big and bulky. Very excited to have this. It has an extra fan you can turn on and off if it gets hot as well.",0
"thought I was going to have a problem going from a laptop to a chromebook with the size of the keyboard, but adjusted easily. Nice having something smaller and lighter for traveling. Not as much I can do on it, but it is adequate. Wish they could make laptops this light weight. Screen is a bit small for me.",0
Ordinateur super bonne excellent portable,0
This thing packs a serious punch. It has handled everything I've thrown at it without issue. I honestly have no complaints at all.If I absolutely had to choose something it'd be the battery life. It lasts maybe 2-3 hours even with the system just sitting idle. Personally not an issue with me because anywhere I plan to use it there is an available outlet to plug into.Other than that everything is great.,0
Great battery life and overall performance! If you need compact yet fast laptop there is no better choice.,0
Is for my son who.is doing gaming and using it for his media class projects,0
"This review is for an Asian i7 64 bit model with touch screen and speedy 1TB SSD instead of 515gb. Needed an ultralight for working and watching videos on seat back tray tables. Was tossed between the Dell 13 and Lenovo Yoga (which I was company issued to me), before buying the Asus ZenBook.What's better?: Very light weight, high metal build quality, nice travel keyboard, bright and clear touch screen, USB 3-port dongle (with HDMI, USB, and DisplayPort connections), accurate touch pad and 2 button pen (like Wacom Bamboo), impressive Dolby sound, 2GB video card for smooth 4K upscaled playback, fast booting (less than 10 seconds), and no crapware.Note that Windows and some drivers will need updating. Expect that process to take 12 hours, although most of that time the install can be run unattended.",0
"It's a great laptop for high school students. It has a fast processor, clean design, and the flip ability is great for online classes and taking notes. I would buy again.",0
"Light weight, touch screen or mouse, thin and easy to carry..... love it.",0
"I was looking for a new Chromie to give my sister as a gift. The Plus V2 jut came out. This thing is beautiful and turbo fast. We have about 50 laptops in our house as we live in Silicon Valley and constantly try and keep up. I use an ASUS C302; wifey has the Google Pixelbook. The only drawback is the non backlit keyboard. If you can get past this, you will love the Samsung Chromebook Plus. I have given 2 of the original models as gifts. Cloud, baby!Update on Thanksgiving - At $449, this thing is a freakin' steal!",0
Looking for a computer that fits in your pocket but functions just like a regular one? This device is the perfect fit.,1
"I love it so much. I have an Acer Aspire E5-771G with Windows 10 Pro, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 1TB HDD and a gforce 940 and 17.3 inches screen, but is so heavy and big, I used just for office or DJing, but when I wanna be at bed or at street, or just for work like a teacher, is so perfect, don't confuse for the price and specifications, is a great productive tool, I use all at cloud, after upgrade to last version It can runs Android apps like Word and Excel and others more. Is small, thin, confortable and very fast and reliable, really, is a great productive laptop, if you will open chrome and use all at cloud, then this is the perfect computer for you.",0
"The amazon listing said this unit had a dvd-r drive. Not true. Otherwise, seems good. More substantial than the asus chromebook it's replacing.",0
"I use this mainly to download and read the local paper, read e-mail, and surf the web. Does all of the tasks very well. If you're looking for a general purpose laptop, I'd highly recommend it.",0

"I am not a gamer at all, so I have no idea how it is as a gaming machine. However, I will tell you the speakers are not audible, so I suspect it will hamper any joy if you're a gamer. I had to replace my Sony Vaio laptop just 14 months after purchasing and right out of warranty the motherboard gave out. I will never again pay top dollar for a computer. This computer is perfectly suitable for online teaching, what I do, and it's very easy to set up. I was concerned about moving from I7 to I3, but it's just as fast as my I7, 16 GB of Ram. This is a very nice machine and is worth the money! The other advantage is that ASUS has a chat function and the reps are very responsive.",0
Business use. Screen quality,0
"Great gaming laptop, especially for the price! This pc will meet your needs. I'm a FPS gamer, and it runs everything on ultra with a smooth 60+fps.",0
"I bought this laptop because it has a solid-state drive (SSD) for programs and a larger traditional hard drive for data. The SSD is quite fast, and my understanding is that it won't slow down over time. The laptop boots quickly, and programs launch quickly.I also like the 15"" screen. My son didn't like it because he has to carry his laptop from place to place during the day, so he needs a more compact laptop. However, the 15"" screen is the size that works best for me.",0
"Pros- Plays every (2020) game at 1080 at max settings.- Runs cool with undervolting via intel xtu app.- Good screen.- Good keyboard.- Easy to upgrade ram- Easy to upgrade ssd- Common, loads of help available online for any issues if you ever have any.Cons- None.",0
"Just received it today, am able to play all my favorite games on it no problem. It doesn't get too loud, and is able to keep the components very cool due to the sheer amount of air that passes through the back and exits the sides. The keyboard is great, the screen is excellent, the battery life is good enough. Its 100% worth it over other gaming laptops in the 1000-1300 dollar range just because of how sleek it looks. Take it into public, and it wont attract any eyes.",0
Mother board died 3 month after warranty. Then you payBut before it was good.,0
"I don't own one of these, but my roommate does. I'm intimately familiar with it, because it's a POS.Let me start by saying I generally enjoy working on computers. This computer is not one I have enjoyed.But I will start with the good: The screen is very vibrant. It's a nice, bright IPS panel. There's a glossy coating, which is something some people like. Glossy panels are hard to see in bright sunlight, but y'all can give the concept of free will a bad name if you want want a shiny screen.The laptop is very easy to open and work in. A dozen screws come out, the bottom pops off and almost everything is right there to be worked upon.Inside this laptop are both an m-key M.2 slot for an nVME solid state drive AND a standard 2.5"" SATA drive bay, which is empty by default. 2.5"" SATA drive bays are uncommon these days, but someone who wants a secondary drive in their computer might be happy to have it. There is a single user-upgradable DIMM slot as well. Acer says this unit supports a maximum of a 16GB DIMM but given the generation of hardware in this PC, I'll bet there's a 32GB module somewhere that will work.There's a condensed numeric keypad for people who like typing off-center while they're using their laptops. See my comment re: glossy screens and the concept of free will, but this was the primary point of attraction for my roommate.This concludes the most positive comments I can make about this laptop.So what's wrong?In this era of USB-C power delivery and fast charging batteries, Acer provides a 45W transformer that charges this laptop in around 150 minutes. That's great, but this laptop only runs for somewhere between 75 and 90 minutes on a full charge for someone doing nothing more intensive than browsing memes on Reddit or typing on a Spreadsheet, and this on a brand new battery on a brand new machine. There's no fast charging. There's no USB-C. As with most Acer branded laptop-shaped things I've seen in the last 20 years, the original AC adapter is also poorly insulated and gets HOT. McDonald's coffee hot. Just under burned skin hot. Because the battery life is atrocious, this is a laptop that's not going to spend much time off its charger.Problem #2 and the biggest reason this thing can go straight into the E-waste pile: The DC input jack is soldered to the motherboard inside the machine, while DECENT laptops have their jacks on a modular port. My roommate keeps her laptop on the coffee table in my living room, and uses it on the couch. She's not moving around with it plugged in beyond occasionally switching between sitting and supine. She's not doing anything unusual to put tension on the cord or the jack. Nonetheless, her DC input broke off inside her laptop. Acer calls that physical damage and won't offer any warranty service on it. I bought a $10 replacement jack and soldered it down. It worked for about nine weeks before it too broke off inside. At this point, the laptop is just over six months old, and I'm certain that if I keep doing this, it's just going to keep breaking. I guess I could solder it down so my roommate can sell the damned thing, but at that point we'd just be inflicting the awfulness on an innocent party.It's also made of relatively thin plastic at all points. It's possible to flex and bow the entire laptop in one's hands. It has just slightly more rigidity than the box it came in.Just to put the cherry on top of this mess: Yes, this thing has an i7. It spends an awful lot of its time pushing against whatever the cooling limitations of the system are. It spends a lot of time with the fan running full blast and NOT running at full speed because the fan and heat sink on this unit are designed for much less powerful parts. I did ameliorate that somewhat using different thermal compound on the CPU during one of the many times I had it apart, but holy crap why would a person unfamiliar with computer hardware ever think to do that?",0
"My Samsung Laptop is amazing, Its the best computer I've ever owned. its fast and flexible. you will love it.",0
"Received this as a birthday gift for travel and light gaming. It was exactly what I wanted and wanted to use it for. Only draw back (when it worked) was the battery life was terrible and the fans got hot very quick even with basic YouTube browsing.As for the 1 star rating. I hadn’t even used the device for 12 hours. The next day when I turned it on, it said the battery was low and went into hibernation. I plugged it in with the charger it came with and nothing. Tried the other lightning port and nothing. Tried different outlets, nothing. After 8 hours of trying to charge it I gave up…. And then it charged for an hour before it stopped charging again.Called customer support. They said weird, send it in for “repairs”…. Why would I repair a new item? They should just replace it! I googled the issue and it’s a very very common issue. Needless to say I returned it and went with a different laptop. I was quite sad because I was excited for it to work.",0
"Bonito dise?o, es bastante rápida",0

"If you want to beat your head with a mallet, choose this laptop over it. I haul a storage drive, battery, and what not to make sure I play one game. I look like a lunatic the amount it takes to do a simple task on this thing. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more",0
"Me gusto es un buen equipo mas por el precio que costo,La verdad me sorprendió la velocidad para abrir las aplicaciones y programas, la trabaje unos días y sin problemas muy rápida en las multitareas,Le a?adiría una memoria ram adicional de 8gb, ya que trae un slot disponible para ellos, y también un disco duro extra para mas almacenamiento ya viene preparada para ellos,lo único que no trae teclado retroiluminado pero de sus materiales se siente bien, la carga le dura buen tiempo adecuado para las tareas básicasen general satisfecho hasta el momento con el equipo",0
"The overall build quality feels cheap. After a couple weeks of use, a number of keys became unresponsive. Nahmic audio driver are terrible. It overheats way too quickly. As many other reviews have pointed out, the battery life is very short.Even the overall look feels cheap. Flimsy plastic parts, monitor 60hz monitor and the Steelseries software/bloatware just stopped working after a while. Looking around forums, it seems this is the general consensus. Just avoid this thing.",0
"Recieved them today. Should have been delivered last week but UPS SUX. Turned on, answered the questions and set up was done. Took just a few minutes.",0
"Excellent battery, speedy, lightweight. You do not often come across these three benefits together. This is still a great purchase if you (like me) do the regular zoom meetings, graphic design, edit 4k video, some spreadsheet work and occasionally edit batches of 100 photos in raw format in Lightroom. Go spend some more in a M1 Pro or Max if you really need that much computational power for 3d or heavy 8k video editing.",0
"What can I say, the laptop is amazing, the screen is 99% RGB, the CPU Ryzen R7 5800h is a monster, the rtx 3050ti with just 4gb of vram is a horrible thing, but still you can't even build a desktop more powerful than this thing for $999, I added 16gb extra ram to a total of 24gb and also a 1tb SSD to a total of 1.5tb SSD this laptop is great for games like red dead redemption 2, GTA v, Doom eternal, but the best thing for me is video editing, it's like 3x faster than my i7 7700k, but this thing is a laptop! You can manually set the tdp limits to make it run really cool and silent when you need it, or Max fans and Max power when you just want UNLIMITED POWAAAAA! 8 cores 16 threads @4.4ghz on a laptop was beyond dreaming just 3 years ago, I really love AMD, the rtx is severely castrated with those 4gb vram but still with dlss and fsr I'm sure it will handle anything for at least 5 years to come",0

A couple things I have notice about this computer…Keyboard and pad are nice, good travel on the keyboard but it does not light up when in the dark. And to right click on the track pad still confuses me.Screen is nice and large but seems a little dim on its brightest setting.Computer is a little flimsy when folding/unfolding.Windows 11 I am actually pretty happy with. Takes a little getting used to but I like the os.Overall good buy for what you are spending on it but not fancy. You get what you pay for but I am satisfied for what I need it for.",0
I could not be happier with this computer! It was priced well and arrived on time and was packaged well. I have really used it a bunch and I am very pleased!,0
"The resolution is weird its like if you get the angle just right its ok, but don't move or its gone. The speaker is worthless. I can't hear my zoom calls. I had to buy an external speaker. It is super fast, though. That's the only reason I didn't return it.",0
"great laptop! The only downside I'd say is how loud it gets under load, but generally quiet overall",0
I have not got into gaming & I didn't know about touch screen.So I will not rate them.,0

"I bought this as an alternative to my last working Msi gaming laptop. The last 3 Msi laptops were disappointing to say the least, defective when received and never repaired properly or were too fragile transporting to work and back, requiring constant maintenance and lasting 1 to 2 years before going out on me. So I was hoping ASUS could do better and wanted a 15.6 for my regular backpack. I was surprised that once I got the Win 11 OS configured right this little rig proved to be one of the best gaming laptops I ever bought. I have owned 6 or 7 over the years and this one impressed me with it's reliability and although it looks kind of frail, proved to be pretty rugged so far. The Fed ex box it came in was banged up and there was virtually no foam, or padding of any kind around the inner box with the laptop - I was really surprised the laptop was not damaged. It is very light as well, so it is easy on an old back, but it will run almost any of my games maxed out and I can game with it in my lap without the fans burning me. No camera which is a bummer and the battery life unplugged is short as you would expect with such a powerful laptop, but I think it is an excellent gaming laptop for the casual or serious gamer hands down.",0
"Review model: Lenovo Legion 5 15 Gaming Laptop, 15.6"" FHD (1920 x 1080) Display, AMD Ryzen 7 5800H Processor, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB NVMe SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050Ti, Windows 10H, 82JW0012US, Phantom BlueTL;DR: I’ve recently tried out three gaming computers on three tiers: a high-end Alienware m15 R4(10th gen i7 with an RTX 3080), a more entry-level Acer Nitro 5 (10th gen i5 with an RTX 3050) and this mid-range Lenovo Legion 5. Out of the 3, the Lenovo Legion (Ryzen 7 with an RTX 3050ti) is actually my favorite. It comes out on top as the best value, with very impressive overall performance and excellent features with few trade-offs.Form & Build:This computer looks fantastic. The subtle navy blue color differentiates the Legion from a lot of other “gaming” computers. The matte finishes hide fingerprints without looking cheap. The monitor hinge is inset from the rear of the computer by a couple of inches making the whole machine feel a lot more stable when the monitor is open--it never feels wobbly or top-heavy. The computer is beefy without being so heavy that you can’t have this thing on your lap (on a good lapdesk, natch).Keyboard & touchpad:If you’ve ever used a Lenovo Thinkpad for work, the keyboard on the Legion will feel very familiar. The main keyboard keys are well-sized and very comfortable to type on. They have good travel with just enough clickiness. Very quiet. I do like that there’s a full number pad. The number pad keys seem like they are slightly smaller than the alpha keys, which makes for a little bit of a lopsided look, but you get used to it very quickly. If you don’t often use the number pad, you barely notice. The touchpad is comfortable and responsive, but could be larger. You’ll likely be using a regular mouse for games, anyway. The RGB backlighting on this laptop is beautiful. There is a selection of different zones and color schemes (it’s not expansive, but the light pastel-y scheme was my favorite), so you can probably find a style and brightness that you like.Display:The screen looks great and even when I wanted something bigger, I had no problem hooking it up to my monitor via HDMI. The bottom bezel is large, lifting the screen a bit and giving you a better viewing angle. The matte finish of the screen succeeds at reducing glare.Graphics:Really impressive given the relatively low-end 3050Ti. The combination of the 3050Ti and the Ryzen 7 CPU seems to be a sweet spot for laptop gaming. Honestly, under every-day play conditions it was hard to tell the difference between my Alienware with a 3080 and the Legion. Based on my play tests with World of Warcraft: Shadowlands and Code Vein, the biggest tradeoff with the Legion (Ryzen/3050Ti) and Alienware (i7/3080) is in ray tracing and anti-aliasing. When ray tracing and anti-aliasing were turned off, the Legion frame rates were almost as good as the Alienware, but I did have the occasional screen-tearing issue, and light bouncing off shiny objects (ray tracing) was not nearly as cool. I also did turn down some distance detail to reduce the rare stutter.In return for a surprisingly meager reduction in visual quality, the Legion gave me outstanding temperature performance. I was totally impressed by the Ryzen 7 in terms of temperature control. I was able to have the Legion out on my lap desk questing while watching TV on the couch. I have never been able to do that with the Alienware. After playing for hours, the keyboard on the Legion never heated up noticeably and the bottom of the computer remained cool to the touch. The Legion effectively ventilates heat through the rear and sides using fans. With my feet up, I could definitely feel that hot air output on my legs, but that heat was consistently moving away from the laptop. The power brick, however, DOES heat up quite a lot. Make sure it’s located somewhere away from metal and loose papers and can get good airflow.",0

While other keyboards will have all letters represented by pressing them, sometimes, you'll need to go back and definitively press each key, as has happened multiple times while typing even this review.There are no worries yet, but I worry how well the keyboard will hold up over time, and I can't imagine that the keys and their functionality will last.",0

SO, I have no idea how much it cost to use the webcam that my laptop came with, and as a result, I cannot connect to Skype to talk to my husband and must continue to use my old Toshiba.I refuse to give this pc a better score when the description says it comes with webcam, but does not state at anytime you must buy activation key to use it.I've waited nearly six years to afford an MSI laptop...niw, I wish I'd never gotten it. 😩I'm ready to return this MSI to Amazon and purchase a whole new laptop from a different company. MSI, make this right.",0
"Amazing for the money. I keep a lot of tabs open at the same time but no lag. Wakens from sleep mode in a flash. Very plain but useful design. Screen is basic, could use a little more brightness and detail, but let's keep the price in mind.",0
"Good experience, fast delivery.",0
Bought for my wife for Christmas. She seems to really like it.,0
"For gaming, works amazing!!",0
Very good laptop,0
Amazing for personal use,0
"I didn't think it would be asking too much to be able to consistently play 720p video from youtube, twitch, espn or disney+, but this laptop often can't get through these videos without freezing and stuttering due to hardware issues.",0
"Two months in, and not a single issue. Boots wuick, runs fine. Fans can be loud for others, but noise is directed away from the user.",0
"Good middle of the road laptop, just wish it came with a solid state drive.",0
"If you are just surfing the WWW, then get a chromebook. Fast, lightweight, no viruses, battery life...just very pleased with my couch friend. Recommended for the price!",0
A good buy for the price.,0
"Works great. Screen isn’t amazing but for the price, it gets the job done fine. If you’re already using Google Products, a Chromebook does seem more useful than an iPad.",0
Bottom line is this a fantastic PC for the price. I have purchased and researched many PCs over the last 20+ years and I also work for a very large technology company. This PC has a fantastic balance of features. If you want a spot on review of the details reference BHATTA’S review from May 2018.The only slight downfall I have found like other has been the average to below average battery life.,0
"I should have gotten more memory. Get at least 500 gig, this is more like a tablet than a laptop, but is fast.",0
It does come pre-loaded with a lot of bloatware,0
It’s a slim computer. Visually it’s great. Screen quality is perfect,0
"I love, love, love this laptop. Perfect for someone who cruises the internet, watches movies and social media.",0
When we received the laptop it was well packaged and very impressive looking. When powered up however the screen did not work. As if there was no back lighting. If you shine a light on the screen you could see that there was in fact something on it but it was too dark to see and the brightness did not adjust. Asus warranty was quick to resolve this and fix it at no charge. Now it’s up and running perfectly. So fast! The colorful RGB lights just set the whole thing off. Awesome looking. The camera quality is fantastic as well. This is great for gaming or for gaming working when I need multiple processes running at once. I’m very happy with it and it’s exactly what I would expect in a gaming laptop at this price point.,0
"I purchased this as a gift for my wife. The description stated it was a touch screen, it's NOT. Beware before purchasing. That was a major selling point for me, & I was disappointed with that. Cross reference info, model #'s, etc with other places before buying here.",0
"Nice, great quality!",0
Top of the laptop is metal and the rest is a super sturdy brushed plastic.,0
Has Alexa and Xbox,0
Good pc for the grandson.,0
For the price and the High end components this MSI came with I thought it was too good to be true. Well it wasn't. So far I've tested its maximum graphics capabilities and haven't succeeded to reach it's limits. I needed something beefy in specs that will handle video editing and this combo with the RTX 2070 that switches between Gaming and Creative Studio mode is just what I needed! So far it's perfect and I'm loving the RGB Keyboard!,0
"Great chromebook. Fast, efficient and great for a full size laptop",0
Really great computer and does everything I needed it to do. Definitley recommend.,0
"Amazing laptop with beautiful graphics and plenty of power for any game you want to throw at it. I have ran halo, splitgate, FIFA and madden all with smooth refresh rates and amazing graphics. Do not look elsewhere. Well built machine with great battery life. I bought this over a razer blade 15 and don’t regret it.",0
"Wanted a mid-range, working out of the box gaming laptop. Got what I wanted and 1 month in, no complaints.",0
"Compared to the 2016 models, I really didn't feel this model was any faster. We have 6 HP touchscreen Chromebooks we use in our medical practice and the original one works just as fast.",0
Great product for the price!,0
"Though the laptop is a steal at that price, there are compromises. The disk space is lower than what was advertised, there is no USB3.0 port, the battery seems to have been removed and replaced, and the general aesthetic does not exactly look new. Either way, it works. I guess you get what you pay for.",0
"The one thing it should do well, work with Google docs, it does not. Trying to edit documents causes it to continually fail, leading to having to reload the document.",0
Works the way it's supposed to.,0
the power button is a little bit too easy to press,0
Solid computer.,0
"There seems to be some confusion about whether or not you can connect external monitors to this laptop, so thought I would clear that up. Without any special adapters you can only connect ONE independent external monitor (can display its own image not just a 'mirror' image). There is 1 HDMI port you can connect this external monitor to. Unfortunately, like many budget laptops, the USB-C port is the older 3.1 gen 1. It cannot output video. My workaround was to purchase a 'StarTech Slim USB 3.0 (or newer like 3.1) to HDMI External Video Card Multi Monitor Adapter' (Part # USB32HDES) for $50. It plugs into a standard Type A USB 3.0 port and works perfectly. Now I have 2 external monitors that are not mirrored. They are independent monitors. Each can display a different image. As far as the other features of the laptop, I have not owned it long enough to say but it seems nice. Anyway, hope that helps someone.",0
"This Acer computer is very well built with great specs. I love the fast 512 GB SSD drive. It makes everything so much faster. There is room for a second hard disk if you need one. The screen is bright and sharp. But it is not a touch screen.The keyboard is very responsive and is a light show on to itself....lots of pretty blue lights shining and blinking. The Trackpad is very responsive. Lots of ports, including including Thunderbolt, 3 USB ports, HDMI, Mini Display and Ethernet.There is really good ventilation to keep everything cool when gaming....vents on both sides and really large vents on the bottom.The build quality of this Acer is extremely good. Everything is solid.The only thing I was unable to do is use the Windows Hello Fingerprint or Face ID. I'm still working on it, so see why I can't get windows to recognize it. The camera works fine...just not recognized by Windows Hello.The Graphics Card is an Nvdia RTX 3060. Did I mention this computer is FAST? IT IS FAST. Highly Recommended.",0
"This is honestly an excellent machine.Not even interested in discussing ""cons"" because there aren't any if you weigh up the price point fairly for what is arguably the best ultra portable laptop on the market right now (July 21') and I don't mean the fastest.The ""only two"" thunderbolt slots can be dongled out to the max. If you want a second or third monitor setup, get any ""display-link"" certified hub like the Dell 452-BCYT D6000 Universal Dock (pricey) or the WAVLINK USB 3.0 Universal Laptop Docking Station,USB C to 5K/ Dual 4K @60Hz Video (cheaper).The 7 cores of GPU on this model won't be noticed vs 8 cores. The machine is a beast. I'm using Lumafusion to process video (not even designed for MacOS but ports across from iPadOS) and it's 3X as fast as the iPad Pro that I own - 2019Best laptop I've ever owned and I've owned two earlier MacBook pro's, a Mac mini, several windows laptops, and the Dell S2721Q 27 Inch 4K UHD monitor I purchased here is parked on top of the last windows machine I purchased.The 4K dell monitor is easily crisp enough for MacOS and I purchased the keyboard used and Magic Mouse (2) new, on Amazon.It's been a while since I've been on MacOS and would describe it as wonderful to use and look at, after coming from windows 10. Sidecar is also amazing (using the iPad Pro to the right for that)If you're shopping for a laptop or a Mac laptop, this is a good option.You'll love it. Nuff said.",0
love it!!!! its just alittle slow...,0
"i like that my grandson could just open it up, plug it in, and the next day he was in his remote class",0
Just want to say it’s exactly What I wanted very happy with it.,0
"Great little laptop.Does everything I need and for the people who said you can't download stuff (uTorrent) yes you actually can. This computer comes pre installed with windows S mode (safe mode) but I wanted to download things other than Microsoft apps all you have to do is update it out of safe mode (you can never go back) but it gives you the option in the app store. Other than that it's really fast, decent picture and really good price. If you need more space just add a micro SD card.",0
"As many before me have said, this is a terrific computer. I returned two computers with a faster processor and more RAM. They simply ran too hot and had fans come on quickly. This Asus has a very good processor and sufficient RAM, but it runs quietly with a solid battery life. It boots in less than 5 seconds for me, and it's speed isn't affected much by my VPN service and other processor chokers.Asus gives you some nice benefits, like the Audio Wizard 10 band equalizer. The backlit keys go off after a bit to conserve power. For the money, just an awesome product.",0

"Good evening,I recently bought a laptop that was supposed to be brand new, however when I removed it from the packaging right after delivery, there was already a dent in the right corner of the laptop and there is a problem with the speaker on the left side. I would like to return this laptop and have a new one sent to me that is not damaged. I have video and picture of the issue. After get delivering it. While unpacking the product, I took an 11-minute video. If you want I can share it too.Thank you.",0
"This is a nightmare to use. Passwords are linked to your google account so if you lose that password, you can reset it but it still insists that you use the old one, the one you lost, or you lose everything that you saved. Don’t even try to put your own wallpaper on or use images. It does weird things to them. I wish I had saved my money and got a different laptop.",0
Excelente producto igual como en la imagen y características,0
It works fine!,0
Lo mejor,0
"Arrived on time. The product is worth the price except for one small problem ( in my opinion) which is the battery life. It doesn't say on the description the battery life and I thought since it's new, it should be 10+ hrs but it's 8 hours and I feel like it runs out really quick.",0
"Been using this for college work, regular googling, and a little gaming here and there. The keyboard is nice and I love the look of rgb lights shining underneath. Visuals look good when watching videos or playing a game. My actual only issue with the laptop is the lack of battery life it has. The laptop is listed for up to 5 hours, yet when i checked the hours it has left it always has a max time of 2 hours which is really poor. I could just have a faulty power supply or may not but 2 hours of battery life is really hard to deal with incase you want to use the laptop on the go. Other than battery life the laptop still looks great and works great as well.",0
"For the most part, Asus did a good job in creating a reliable and enjoyable laptop with the Vivobook ""Pro"" 14. I put ""Pro"" in quotations because other than the selling page here on Amazon and on Asus' website, there is no ""Pro"" mention once you get the actual computer, other than it comes with Windows 11 Pro. But that's not a big deal.What is a big deal, or certainly a noticeable one, is the out of box experience. The laptop arrived with ZERO PERCENT charge. For a second I thought I had gotten a DOA laptop, but it came to life the moment I plugged it in. And what's the deal with that huge brick-on-a-leash charger for a 14-inch laptop? I was working with a customer at work who has a 17-inch Vivobook laptop and had a much smaller charger than my 14-inch model. Anyway, after going through all the initial Windows 11 setup, I was told the computer needed to download the upgrade to Windows 11. What?! I thought I was already using Windows 11. Oh well... The whole out of box experience was kind of messy, but the computer has been great once past that point.",0
"The steel series keyboard feels clicky and amazing, looks ""gamey"" with its RGB lighting, and still keeps a premium/stylish look",0
MSI chooses not to fine-polish the hard external plastic cover of the laptop so the micro scratches covering the entire laptop will collect every single dust particle and snack crumbs and other biologicals,0

"well the headline says it all! Very clean and responsive laptop! Light weight for its size, and powerful! Heavily used for Office365 (separate software purchase) and PDF writer/creator so RAM was important. Screen is really nice, easily work though thousand line spreadsheets, crisp web graphics and in the end plays games and has no refresh rate issues! All in all a well rounded laptop well worth every penny! Love the lit keyboard, the on board mouse is really quite handy. Some others are just terrible to use, not this one! I switched it out of S Mode in 20 seconds so don't let that be a deciding factor! (just google it, its a free change/update)Simply put, go ahead and buy this one. Its a really good buy!",0
Fast!,0
Fans get really loud while gaming so better to use headphones.,0
"This was an emergency ""work from home"" purchase. It has been doing a wonderful job so far. The touch-screen is very responsive and helps me to be much more productive than I would be without it.Honestly, I switched from an old Macbook Pro (which, while old, was very reliable and performed extremely well) to this and had low expectations, but for work and streaming video meetings, it performs just as well as the Macbook. My transition to this machine felt seamless.",0
"This laptop has an 85W 3070 that performs similar if not worse than a high power 3060. The spec sheet for this model states that it has a 130W max 3070. I spoke with MSI support and the going theory is that there's a typo on the spec sheet. I will be returning this and replacing with a laptop with a higher performing 3070.Edit: MSI has corrected the spec sheet and it now lists 3070 max 85W.Beyond the mix up with the GPU max power, the build quality of the laptop is decent if not good. The keyboard feels nice enough to type on and the backlit keys look good. The screen is nothing to write home about but is adequate. No mux switch. The cooling is decent, although fans are of course loud - during combined stress test with looping fire strike extreme, in extreme performance mode in MSI center with fans on auto, the CPU rarely dropped below 4500Mhz and the GPU only throttled slightly at around 81-82C. Fans showed 50dB on an android sound meter app. The battery is on the small side, so I only saw about 3.5 hours of charge on battery saver and lower brightness / turning off keyboard backlight.Changing my 1 star review to 3 stars because the laptop isn't terrible, I just don't appreciate being misled on such an important spec.",0
The touchpad/screenpad never worked right out of the box. Spent over an hour on the phone with ASUS tech support plus a couple more trying various things I found on the internet but wasn't able to get it to work. Very disappointing. At least the Amazon return process was easy.,0
"I purchased this computer back at the end of March and since then, I’ve had issues with the computer. For example, there are days I cannot use the computer longer than 5 minutes before it randomly restarts. I don’t dare to take an exam in my laptop or even watch a zoom lecture because it will most likely restart and I will have logged off my exam and zoom meeting. I tried to fix it multiple times but nothing seems to work. And then, out of nowhere, the screen broke (after research it seems like this can happen to Microsoft’s newer computers). I never had any kind of issues with my Apple computer and am regretting this purchase.",0
"I really had high hopes for this laptop but I found a couple of issues that caused me to return it. First, there was a little bit of backlight bleed on the bottom left side of the screen. While the screen was nice and there was the normal amount of IPS glow, the little white light bleeding through on the bottom left caused me some concern. Although it was not much, it was enough for me to wonder if it would get worse over time. Knowing that there have been some who have complained about screen issues, I did not want to take the chance.Second, the laptop had a few keys that had tactile issues. The #3, #4, and W were not as responsive and springy as the other keys. When I barely moved my fingers across the number row without applying pressure, I could feel that the #3 and #4 keys seemed to be off a little. It worked when typing but I could tell the difference between them and the other keys. The W key was not as bad but you could still feel the difference between it and the Q, E, A, and S. While they may have never caused any issues throughout the life of the laptop, I don't want to take that risk with a $1000+ laptop. I have seen videos and forum posts about this same model where keys are sticking and/or not responding. I did not want to send it to Lenovo for warranty service since I just bought it. Personally, I don't trust a device that has to receive warranty repairs right out of the box. Hopefully, Lenovo can address these issues because this seems like it could be a very great machine.",0
"This has all the bells and whistles of a $1000 laptop. I love the SSD which powers up and gets you going. The only annoying thing which I discover buying computers on Amazon is the need, in this case, to call HP customer support because the computer went to dark screen as soon as it booted up. The problem: In the eleven months this set on a shelf, it missed several software updates. Fifteen minutes later all was good. And HP extended the warranty one year because only 14 days remained on the original. Thank you, HP. If you can stand such inconveniences, a really great deal.",0
"My last chromebook from another company had the same issue. This one is brand new straight out of the box. The charging plug has to be pushed in a certain way or it will not charge. It is a very loose connection and I suspect it will not make it long before it breaks and I have to start propping up against a wall just so it will charge. This is a very frustraiting design flaw with many of these inexpensive laptops. Other than that, it is a very basic laptop and serves my needs.UPDATE: The screen is starting to blackout/smudge in the bottom and top corners. I wasn't expecting a great computer for this price but this is pathetic. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.",0
I thought this would be like a normal laptop. I have trouble figuring it out. Not real happy with it because the only thing I can seen to do like normal is get online. Instructions on how to use are not as clear as I would like. Making documents and accessing are not easy. I would not recommend this but would recommend a small normal laptop were you could actually make a word document. I bought this so I wouldn't have to always take my larger laptop. This has not happened. Would be nice to have a user friendly manual. Size and weight good.,0

"Excellent computer for the price. Consider this recommended specs for a successful windows 10 experience in my opinion. The hardware inside hits all the requirements for a good windows laptop without overkill parts.

"I wanted to like this laptop, and initially I was excited to use it. Immediately upon opening the shipping box I noticed that it was labeled on the physical laptop that it ran windows 10 in S mode. What this means is that any function, download, or App that is not curated from the Microsoft Store will not run in the computer. One can turn off S mode pretty easily but it negatively impacts the speed and performance of the laptop. The specs that the laptop advertises are generated when using S mode, so when turning off S mode, the qualifications the laptop sold you on, can be incorrect. I do not want this feature, and my problem is that this feature was not displayed accurately or, well, even at all on this store page. Had it been mentioned and accurately advertised that this computer ran in S mode, I would not have purchased it.That by itself wouldn't have warranted a review, but this laptop at the time of me writing this, is less than 24 hours old and I'm being notified during the boot sequence that a broken fan (90B) is being detected and continued use of the laptop will result in possible system failure (it will break the system). The fact that this laptop shipped broken, with an obvious fan issue, pushes me to attempt to get a refund. I didn't want to spend time on this, I have enough already in my day but I can't waste money on faulty products and can't spend more to fix something that should have been 100% functional when it was shipped to me. This is probably an unusual event for these laptops, and honestly if it wasn't for the broken fan I would have been content, but again, can't throw money at things that should have worked on reception.",0

"I have used many Windows and MacBook laptops. This was intended as a second laptop in addition to my MacBook Pro 2017 (15""). The prices on high-powered gaming capable devices are lower than they've ever been.- I don't play the most modern games but I have some titles that I tried that I knew many older ones that had given me problems in the past. These are titles from 3-10 years ago, so it's not the most updated test, but everything is smooth and fast at the highest settings.- From a hardware standpoint, I love the muted design that makes it look more professional than ""gamey."" The keyboard and mousepad are the best I've ever tried on a Windows laptop (I expected that from Lenovo). While the machine is mostly plastic, the plastic feels solid.- I almost customized a machine from Lenovo but realized that I could only get one with a 144Hz display directly from Amazon. I'm very glad I did. The display is obviously not as sharp or vibrant as what I have on my MacBook but I see it serving a different purpose with its 144Hz display. The display surface is also matted rather than glossy, so you don't get sharp reflections coming off the screen (which I like).- I know there's a way to add more storage to this, so I'll look into it. The 512GB built-in is a good start.- The cooling on this laptop is extremely well done with large vents underneath and four outtake vents. The display hinge does not get in the way of the fans and you can still bend it all the way back 180 degrees.- Most of the connections are at the back with markings to show you from the top where they are located. On the side, you have the standard USB 3 on each side and a headphone jack on the left.- Sound is better than I expected, but my expectations were low there. This definitely is nowhere near as rich as my MacBook but that was not expected.- The power brick is ginormous, but it's 270W (that's higher than PSUs I used to put in desktops once upon a time). It obviously limits the mobility of this machine but no one expects an ""ultra portable"" when looking for a machine of this power.That's all I can think of for now. Great purchase.",0

All in all, a good machine for the money for what I'm doing with it. And it's Android, so there isn't the maintenance overhead of a Windows machine. Buy em for your road warriors.EDIT 17 Jan 19 - I'm currently working to get the StrongSwan VPN client to working in order to connect Point-To-Site to my Azure VPN. I know it can be done, but getting the StrongSwan configuration correct is a bear. If anyone out there has used StrongSwan to connect P2S to an Azure VPN, send me a comment. Otherwise, I'll post when I get it working on my own. Why do this? So that I can access my Linux VMs via SSH and my Windows Server VMs via RDP.",0

This is a very good product. It have a big screen but it is not touch screen. It’s really good at playing video games,0
"I'm really only using this laptop for three things-Internet browsing-word processing via (google docs)-emails*possibly light gaming such as hearthstone or solitaire/sudukoFor it's three main uses it functions very well. I mainly use this laptop for school. The 8gb of ram are plenty for my needs and the hard is ok which I'll get into.Connections-2 usb ports (one of them is a 2.0 and one of them is 3.0) however when you at the side of the laptop you cant tell which one is which cause they both look the same and the small guide that come with the laptop does not show you which is which, but that's ok for me.-1 headphone/mic combo jack-1 HDMI port (this is particularly good if you plan to mirror you screen to a television)-1 ethernet connection (RJ-45) this is the basic ethernet connector most people use-1 power adaptor port-1 usb C port-1 card reader (which I haven't used yet)-1 connector to hook up a locking cable for you laptop (I probably will never use this but cool feature anyways)After opening the box-I like that it is a very light weight laptop which is great for traveling and school-the keyboard feels fantastic (much better than my previous lenovo)-the track pad works well and if you look at one of my photos it has some special features that allow you to zoom in on the screen and use in a way similar to a smart phone (these features also apply to the touch screen version of this laptop but the laptop I am reviewing is not a touch screen) I personally prefer a laptop with out the touch screen feature-The description says that the hard drive is a 128 GB SSD. It is indeed a SSD but they maximum capacity is 118 GB and after OS installation, windows updates, and some basic apps, the storage left over is about 80 GB. This is ok for me. When you think about it 80 GB is still a lot of storage space, and I have a 1TB external hard drive that im using to store most of my files. Also If you prefer there are many ways to get free cloud storage such as dropbox or google drive. If you plan to store large videos and/or massive amounts of photos I would recommend getting and external hard drive. (keep in mind this laptop does have a card reader so you could also get yourself a some kind of sd card for storage space as well) Also this laptop comes in a 256 GB storage capacity, I'm guessing after the formalities it's closer to 225 GB.-The screen looks good. Its clear and bright (adjustable). great definition-The sound is ok. It really the same as you would expect for any laptop. I will be using my song headphone if I feel like getting better sound-There is a little fan that runs, but you will hardly notice it.-The laptop top does come with some bloat ware but you can sort that for your self or just keep. ( you might not even notice the difference)-The cold start time is about 8 seconds (that's really fast!)Things to Note-Don't buy the expert setup. Save yourself the 80 dollars and buy some accessories. The setup is simple and the laptop will walk you through the process (nothing major to do). All I did was plug in the laptop to an outlet, turned it on, and cortana walks you through the process. It only take about five minutes. Add another five minutes to run windows update and download/install the newest updates. It really is easy.-This laptop does not have a CD drive. It says so in the description on amazon. I'm just pointing it out for those who skipped straight to the review section.-If gaming is your biggest concern I would not suggest this laptop. It does have a decent processor and amount of ram, but it's more for general use and apps that consume less of your cpu power.-Amazon offers a warranty. You can get it if you want; that part is really up to you, and depends on how much abuse you think you might put your laptop through. If you're on the fence about the warranty, HP themselves offer a warranty that you can purchase after the fact when you setup the laptop for the first time. I believe it cost 80 dollars for three years.In conclusionIf you feel like you identify with the student/worker/average person who needs a laptop for travel and general use, you can purchase this laptop knowing it will perform well for you. HP is a great brand and makes reliable computers. I would highly recommend this laptop for anyone who plans to use it for school.",0
Bought for my niece for school - she loves it. works well.,0
"I bought it for my 8 year old daughter for school and it was a good choice. Pocket size, battery longs for a week. The only problem that it makes some problems with Zoom app, maybe because the low memory / hardware.",0
"i bought the laptop on 12/22. set it up on 12/28. returning it same day. Literally the worst laptop ever. stick to name brands, its worth the extra money. processor is super slow, required 10+ window updates upon 1st set up which took more than 4 hours. 3 calls to tech support (very helpful btw). don't buy it.",0
"I had an older model of this for a couple of years and LOVED it. I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this substandard, fails to meet basic standards, laptop. It's NOT fast (as much as I could tell, being able ONLY to use the trackpad. I am going to buy a year old, less specced xps 13. Because they just work. Out of the box work.",0
"Thus far, it serves its purpose. It came to me practically brand new. No scratches or dents. It travels well and I'm able to check my emails, surf the web, and complete my second job requirements through the companies software. Lastly, it was affordable on my meager income.",0
"I love the touchscreen. The older I get the worse my eyes are. I can easily enlarge the screen to read emails, articles, etc. It was super easy to set up when I took it out of the box. For what I do on the computer this is the perfect one for me.",0
Large screen with sharp vivid color. Impressive quality for the price.,0
"Aside of better graphics and newer Intel, it's pretty lightweight compare to the Nitro 5.",0
"El equipo es muy bueno en cuanto la relación precio-calidad. Ahora bien, hay dos modelos y uno de ellos tiene la pantalla táctil. Así que sería bueno que los vendedores definan bien esto.Un detalle de diseño es que no tiene entrada USB por ambos lados, eso resta comodidad a la hora de por ejemplo tener un mouse.",0
"The laptop itself comes packed in a bag, with some protective material, rather than a box - it was shipped from Amazon in a box of course, but inside was just the laptop (see image 1). It took me a few minutes to figure out how to plug it in - the plug adapter isn't a standard (see image 3), and it goes into the leftmost port (see image 4). The keyboard has this, um ""interesting"" feature that it keeps changing backlight colors (see images 5 & 6). If you're not 12, you'll want to turn this off. You can change it with Fn + Space: that will either stabilize the backlight color or turn it off entirely. The keyboard itself is a bit crowded into a smaller space than I'm used to because it has a numeric entry pad on the right - odd for a laptop, but after I got used to the slightly smaller keyboard space, I appreciated the included number entry pad.Performance is great, and battery life is fine. I usually leave it plugged in and it can charge from 0 - 100% in about a half hour. The GPU may not be desktop grade, but it's solid and ray-traces in real time as advertised - especially surprising in a laptop, even when not connected to power.",0
"Great Computer, Runs great, Screen is clear, fast and easy setup. I don't play game so I can't help you out with that.",0
"This laptop was for my daughter she loves it , it is fast and perfect for her needs",0
After having an ASUS Zenbook really disappointed by Dell. Quality Control is a problem. Buying a new labtop after less than a year.,0
This is a light and thin laptop,0
"I've had the computer for almost a year without too many issues. I just can't ""connect to the internet."" HP is uesless. I tried to contact them, but never had any luck. I tried their worthless program they install on the computer, but I can't use it because I am not connected to the internet. I am using the laptop to write this, yet...somehow I am not connected to the internet. I will never buy another HP again.",0
"I like the laptop very much and planned to buy it for my son’s Christmas gift, but the price just keep on increasing and I start to think if there is other options. I have decided to just build a pc since it is cheaper and have a better performance anyway. I am leaving a comment to remind the buyers to see if the price keep on increasing then just buy the i7 one instead. The i7-9750h (way faster cpu) come with gpu rxt 2060 (bang on the money) and 16 go of ddr4 ram (no upgrade needed.) Only thing is to add another ssd or hhd (2tb recommended.) Hope if this help!",0
"So I got this laptop because I love MSI, and I really wanted a laptop that would last me more than a year (I have really bad luck with computers)",0
Ami hijo le encanta mucho para sus video juegos,0
"The notebook itself wors fine, for personal use it`s ok, but it came with broken screen and couldn`t return it",0
My daughter is happy with it,0
"Somehow this MacBook Air feels bigger than the 2020 model yet they are the exact same length and width. The screen opens very smoothly, which is a nice change from the 2020s somewhat stiff lid pull. I love how this feels in your hands. The flat surface makes it easier to grip. The black finish looks incredible. I thought it was going to be a darker gray finish but no, it’s jet black, and it looks magnificent.All in all this is a huge upgrade from the 2020 MacBook Air. Highly recommend.",0
"When I went into a $1000 laptop I felt I had set myself up for pretty low expectations. In the past affordable laptops had underclocked quad cores, and weak low power gpus. Thanks to Zen, this laptop actually cooks. The 4800h is comparable to to a Ryzen 3700 desktop processor and you certainly feel it. On this laptop Multitasking feels smooth like a desktop, and rendering almost feels the same (ram upgrade necessary). The 1660ti has no problems at all running games at ultra settings on the 1080p 144hz screen, while you likely won't hit 144fps to fully saturate the screen I never felt uncomfortable with the frames this laptop is able to produce. The computer only came with a 512gb SSD but, with the smaller battery there is an additional 2.5"" space made available and adding a 2tb basic spinning disk this computer really became the no compromised machine I was looking for. With this laptop I can go out of town, and not miss my $3500 custom desktop too much! I really don't feel like I lose much on this device when I have to switch on the go and that's the best review I can ever give for a $1000 laptop!",0
"This laptop was purchased for remote school and light gaming (equivalent to Madden series). The laptop is very quick and snappy with regular office work, so my middle schooler is pleased with it's performance. Whenever I need to jump on to troubleshoot, I'm also please at the response of the operating system (Windows 10). The laptop sleeps for about 1 week before being restarting. After about a week, it's still snappy, which is awesome for Windows, but I suspect poor memory management leaves apps open and the CPU fans will be roaring, even when idle. Game performance for Madden or driving games has shown no issues. The high refresh rate of the monitor is definitely noticeable and worth it. However, as with many gaming laptops, even while not gaming, the battery is lucky to last 2.5 hours.",0
"I had the exact same wi-fi network issues as everyone else has mentioned. I bought this for graduate school and online classes - I need a more dependable wifi computer than this one. The Troubleshooting recommended attaching an ethernet chord, but there is no ethernet port to connect to on the laptop. I tried resetting my modem and restarting the computer multiple times, to no avail. The laptop isn't recognizing ANY network - phone hotpsot or internet modem. I tried registering it on HP and the product number cannot be found, so I was SOL on HP tech support too. I'm processing a return today.",0
"La laptop es hermosa pero hace un sonido raro al prenderla y a los dos dias de usarla mientras veia netflix me salia error 401 o 404 no recuerdo, en pantalla azul y hacia un sonido aun mas raro y fuerte. La bateria es poca.",0
"I have been looking for a laptop for sometime now - roughly 6 years. I am upgrading from an i5 HP Desktop computer. Its trash, but you know what isn't trash? This awesome MSI laptop!I wanted a laptop that could handle long hours of gaming -Sims 4, House Flipper, Diablo, etc. I'm not into any PVP really so I can't speak to those games, but I have been playing Persona 4 Golden for over 30 hours and the game is beautiful. Runs smoothly, image looks beautiful, and I don't worry about the laptop overheating. I used a cooling tray with the laptop for extra cooling but the laptop cools really well on its own to begin with. The keyboard is great and I actually find myself typing better than on past laptops. The keyboard colors are even better. I NEVER wanted MSI stuff in the past because their color is red. I don't want red lights all over my computer and I almost skipped this over because I didn't think they'd ever change from red to rainbow! Well my little gay heart is so happy with this keyboard and all the fun color customization it can do! One last thing that I really liked about this laptop is the lack of bloatware! I only had to remove some lame Microsoft Office files and everything else was legit! When buying my HP in the past it was LOADED with garbage programs. MSI did not do this. Thank you, MSI for being more consumer friendly.If I had ANY complaints, here they are: (1) I have a couple dead pixels on my screen. If I'm paying about $1500 for a laptop, I am expecting a pristine screen - I did not get this. However, the pixels are near where the taskbar is and if I change my theme to something dark the pixels are barely noticeable. I'm too easy going to return this and start fresh with a new laptop, so I have made my peace. (2) The volume - the computer has decent sound, until the jet engines start and the laptop starts to enter the outer atmosphere.... or at least thats what it sounds like! Honestly, pop in some headphones and you are fine, but otherwise the computer is loud when the fans are on. Still: loud fans > overheated laptop, so again, not a major complaint. (3) The brightness is too much for me. I suffer from light sensitivity and I can only use this laptop on the DIMMEST setting and it still feels TOO bright. My former laptop was not visible on the dimmest setting, so I was hoping this one was the same deal. Nope. (4) The DELETE key is not above the backspace key.....come on, why do I need the pause break key where delete used to be?So as you will see, my complaints are super minimal. If you are even considering buying this laptop, in the words of Shia LaBeouf, JUST DO IT. Its awesome and you will not regret it.P.S. Learned about a free program called Dimmer that can help with the brightness, so looks like this isn't even that much of an issue anymore!",0
Wish it had windows and office downloaded on it,0
The curved space bar on this keyboard provides a more comfortable typing experience.,1
100% satisfied!Fantastic value!,0
"I love this laptop beause it is low priced with very advanved hardware and also has a sleek look to it, I can play games at 100+ fps consistently and also allows mr to take care of my work/daily needs, overrall this comeupter is fulfilling what I wanted it tto do and more I would reccoemnd buying this if looking for a Low Priced but high capacity laptop.",0
"My niece is going to love it, it's not too big or too small.",0
"At this price level its bang for buck discussion. The display has a bluish hue and I'm not sure if it's adjustable. It's a little dark also. I'll see if its adjustable, but it doesn't appear so. Setup was a breeze, was surfing the internet within 3 minutes. Battery charge seems to be excellent. So, Bang for Buck, you cannot go wrong. My demerits are on display qualities, but for under 200 dollars delivered, I have lowered expectations. This replaces my MacBook air.",0
Awesome product thank you,0
It's a lot like using my Android phone,0
All of a sudden the left side usb ports stopped working. It stopped recognizing my wireless mouse... now I only have one on the right side to use. Very inconvenient.,0
"ROG Strix Scar 151920x1080300hz16GB RAM 8 VRAM$2,499 with the taxI play RDR, Horiz9n Zero Dawn, Crysis 1,2,3, Overwatch, NFS, Horizon 3,4, Doom, Doom 2, Batman Arkam Knight, FIFA2021, Battlefield series, Call of Duty All series.I played these games with Ultra in graphic setting.Very smooth, no hitching, no lagging, really fast, fast response.If you want to spend more than $2,000 for gaming laptop, this is the one. This was my first huge expenditures in my life. I am sure it was worth it. Never regret. I am not paid to write a review. This is legit 100% personal opinionated review. RGB lighting is awesome, also I know that some of Asus or ROG laptops have low sound volume even though it is maximum. I tested with my new laptop, it loud, crystal clear, and crisp with dolby atmos technology. Almost, every game in the gaming market, you can play with maximum graphic setting. By the way, this is my first review in Amazon. Hope it helps.",0
"Cheap, screen broke fast",0
"El equipo llegó en perfectas condiciones, incluso se adelantó un día en la llegada.Viene excelentemente equipado con el procesador de ultima generación y en serie HQ que lo hace mas potente para los graficos, ademas la tarjeta de video que incluye es de gran rendimiento. El almacenamiento tambien es super bueno, con disco en estado solido de 256 GB y disco duro de 1TB.Excelente compra, además de ser muy liviano y tener un gran diseño sobrio!!!",0
"Buena laptop. Es una computadora muy buena para ofimática, navegar por internet y contenido multimedia. La pantalla no tiene mucho brillo, pero es el adecuado, tiene pésimos ángulos de visión y el sonido no es muy bueno. La calidad del material de construccion es regular. Para uso cotidiano es muy buena.",0
the laptop is a great combination of light weight and performance,0
The fingerprint security is terrific - works very well.,0
Lid started to come apart less than one month after I got it,0
"Good system, but wifi keeps dropping. There is no solution for it, so wired keeps it from dropping.",0
Small computer perfect for work laptop plenty of power,0
apparently it has a RTX 2070 graphics card but I can only play many of my favorite games like BFV and Anthem with Low-Medium graphics settings and even then its buggy and laggy,0
Very functional laptop. Good for school work and gaming. Skyrim has never run so smoothly. My only criticism is that it is prone to fingerprints. I don't particularly mind the lack of CD drive since most software is downloadable these days and I rarely burn CDs.,0
"Setup was incredibly fast and easy, with Cortana guiding the way",0
"I have been using it for a several months now. Writing review on it right now. I love this chromebook. It's my 3rd in about 10 years and so far so good with no problems. Screen quality is good. I have used it for Zoom calls and video messaging and it works as well as my work laptops that are considered top notch and cost 3-4 times as much.I don't game on it but streaming netflix, prime, disney+, shopping, writing documents, browsing the internet, writing emails, video calls and messaging are all awesome and work excellent.",0
The keyboard is amazing.,0
Es más peque?a,0
"This thing has juice, runs most games on either ultra, or high settings. I think it ran noisy when I got it, but just down load the nvidia setting, and turn on the quite setting, and life is good. Sometimes I use the turbo button but it's loud, use headphones with it. So anyways a great machine.",0
Love it!,0
Wasn’t the size I expected,0
The MacBook has a better screen. But asus is also great.,0
"I rarely hate a product. The Lenovo Flex laptop is that rare product. Two deal breakers for me: 1) the flex hinges are insufficient and the screen wobbles and jiggles and must be very strategically braced against something unmovable like a wall. 2) the lip on the edge of the computer casing that your keyboard fits into is sharp, abrasive and irritating to my wrists. It is higher than the surface so it scrapes and rubs on your wrists at all times. It is even irritating through my shirt and sweater let alone bare skin being scraped and abraised. Since this is not a warrant issue Lenovo does not stand behind my purchase. So, never again will I buy another Lenovo product.",0
My son loves it thanx!!,0
"It's a great weight, a great feel (aluminum case), and the specs are so great",0
"Llevo 2 meses con el portátil y se ha comportado perfectamente, lo compre porque uso programas de dise?o arquitectónico que demandan rendimiento grafico y procesamiento, hasta el momento rinde perfecto para Revit 2021 - Adobe - Twinmotion , etc. La pantalla podría tener un poco mas de brillo y el sonido podría ser mejor. Se deja actualizar fácilmente, en mi caso amplié el disco duro 480 gb mas y la RAM la aumente de 8 a 16, por el precio del portátil es una excelente opción, lo recomiendo.",0
"Screen isn't top of the line, but it's a good machine for the price.",0
"After initial setup, the machine stopped being able to connect to the internet. Wifi wasn’t even an option anywhere to be found in settings or anywhere. I got a replacement and the same thing happened to the replacement. Nothing was clicked, the awful driver was no where to be found. I do not recommend.",0
"With the 13"" screen, the pixel density is great and makes 1080p video look great.",0
Wifi/Bluetooth module is fried after light to moderate use.,0
Loud coil whine and Hugh fan speed seemingly at random but otherwise great laptop,0
"Absolutely love the laptop. It's been close to a year now that I have been using the latop. One of the best one's I have owned till date. Really changed my perception of Asus as a company. Will make the decision again. Great battery life, quick and sleek.",0
"So I’ve had this just about 3 weeks , I love it!!! Do yourself a favor get the 1050ti it really boosts this laptop. The ssd makes this thing boot up really fast and smooth, the i7 is new to me I use amd I’m very impressed with it. Gaming on this thing is nice I haven’t found anything that won’t run ultra I’m sure there is some but not many. I also just got into video editing and this really does a great job at it. The turbo boost fan keeps this running cold. Overall I’m in love with this laptop it’s lightweight battery if not gaming goes about 4 hours a little less gaming maybe a 1 hour time.",0
It was amazing Lang battery lifeLight wieght perfect for travling,0
I use this as a tower stand in. The chassis feels cheaply made compared to my last MSI laptop. Over all performance is 8/10. Not bad but nothing really stands out.A good deal for the price. Some hot spots on the screen but they're hardly noticeable while in use.Over all 7/10,0
The wifi card on this seems really strong as I always have a consistent fast connection with no drop outs.,0
"I have been using Acer computers for a few years now and have always been pleased. This is a nice, thin, light, modern laptop with a good keyboard and a sharp screen. The 8 GB's of RAM is working just fine for the web surfing, videos and MS Office activities that I use it for. I am happy with the price and the performance.",0
"At first I was hesitant to get a refurbished laptop. I previously purchased a new unit last year also a Dell XPS 13. Unfortunately it was stolen. I am so satisfied with the Dell XPS 13 that I bought a slightly newer model, however refurbished. The new unit is simply beyond my budget. Honestly, I think there is no difference between a new unit and this certified refurbished unit.",0
Love my chrome book. Bought for college online and it exceeds expectations.,0
"It's very light for a 17 inch laptop, good for portability around the house.",0
I loved everything about it,0
Awesome chromebooks for the price you pay. I bought 3 of these for my nieces as a christmas gift. They all love these! Nice one samsung!,0
"If these are refurbished, you really wouldn't know it. Works perfectly. No signs of use at all.",0
The battery life isn't exactly mind blowing and that's pretty understandable considering how powerful it is. The screen is amazing and gta5 at max settings gets me between 70 and 130 fps online. Rdr2 at max settings gets about 45 fps. These are without messing with the overclock settings.,0
Works as advertised.,0
Hola tengo problemas con esta lap se reinicia a cada rato y no te deja entrar a ningún navegador de internet porque se reinicia cuando quiero abrir mi correo también se reinicia no se cual sea el problema mejor la voy a devolver,0
"Made for gaming. I've had no problems running various games at high setting with no frame rate drop. As far as everything else, no complaints. Gets a bit warm after a while, like any laptop made for gaming would. Invest in an external fan.",0
We thought it had a touchscreen but it didn’t. Glad it has lit keyboard. We got the silver color. The white letters on the keys are hard to see. Otherwise no complaints. It was a good price.,0
Good quality screen. Just the seller s&l business wasn't so good to deal with,0
Love this computer runs very fast and works with all the programs I needed it for. It is also very lightweight.,0
"My MSI Leopard GL 65 arrived yesterday and I couldn't be happier. All I can really say is it runs everything in my steam library really well, the screen is very sharp and bright and it has an excellent keyboard and trackpad. The computer feels really solid and well built and I think its going to last me a very long time. I did notice that the computer can get hot while gaming so you might not want to play with it in your lap.",0
"I have not been able to find a better laptop that functions the way this one does. Its fast, sleek, and soo portable.",0
My wife loves her chrome book. The battery lasts mich longer than any laptop she’s had before.,0
"Es una laptop muuy buena, tiene teclado retroiluminado (no RGB), buenos componentes, el mouse pad tiene un lector de huellas que funciona muy bien y me gusta mucho, la cámara es de buena calidad, y el micrófono no me gusta tanto, pero sirve muy bien.Lo único que no me gusto, es la pantalla, la batería dura poco y que el teclado no esta en español.En general, muy buena laptop, me sirvió mucho para mis clases online, jugar minecraft y algunos otros juegos, ver netflix y usar chrome, me gusto mucho y es buena opción si buscas algo de calidad a un buen precio",0
Easy to use - Stone Age husband likes it & that’s all that counts!,0
"Just 2 days after the return window closed and the sound stopped working. It had had issues with a crackling sound and I was going to try to contact customer support, but didn't realize how close it was to my return window closing and then this happened. Yet again Amazon has now sold me 2 overpriced computers that ultimately don't work.",0
"What a great laptop; lovely clear screen, great performance and everything was up and running within a short time. The change to using Windows 10 was so much better than earlier versions of windows. Pleased with battery life and power management options. The only real regret I have is that Amazon is deciding to not seriously service the Australian market going forward and so great products like this at great prices are no longer available.",0
"this laptop has some wifi issues. when it comes back on after sleep, wifi often does not work. you will have to reboot it. this is really inconvenient. every time you close your laptop there is a high chance that you'll end up having to restart the computer. sometimes, you'll have to reboot it again and again until the wifi works. I am currently traveling, and this is really frustrating. I missed the return window, and I cannot even get any warranty service until I get back home. I am afraid it's getting worse and it may not last until the end of my trip.. very frustrating...",0
I like the brand name dislike the size and no windows 10 or dvd player.,0
This laptop is more for socal Media app games ect. It's good but very little memory and the screen resolution is poor,0
Heavy screen bleed in upper right hand corner on first boot. Otherwise good quality picture. Returned. Photo is supposed to be an all black screen with the exception of the mouse.,0
Wireless performance was very lag spikey with the included wireless module.,0
"I buy the GIGABYTE AORUS 15P XD with the 3070, after one or two hours playing many games as deathloop, shadow of Mordor, Marvel Spider-Man and others, the battery power decrease considerable even when the laptop is connected to the power, the battery power decrease to 50 - 70 percent depending on the game. This issue will cost the battery life and the rise of the temp in the laptop. Also, after 30 o 40 minutes playing for no reason the audio start to fail no matter if I use my Logitech G pro or the speakers.This is an expensive gaming laptop, and the least you can expect for that price is a decent gaming laptop, but it isn't.",0
"Beautiful, thin, light, state of the art M2 chip midnight MacBook is one of my best purchases ever. My son wanted one for college and I told him I could get him an Intel based laptop with the same power for much less money. He got a MacBook and he was right. Forward thinking. I was afraid of the jump from intel to something I wasn’t familiar with. 15 minute set up and it took all of my contacts, news, emails, bookmarks and pictures from my IPhone 10 X Max over WiFi. Added an 8-1 hub, a mouse and Microsoft Office Home and Business 2021 lifetime license ($35) for less than $100. Love this thing and won’t look back. Not a techie nor early adopter. People claim they’re good for 10 years. Take a leap!",0
It works well as described.,0
It suddenly croaked after 23 months of use. Now I have to buy a new laptop but NOT an Asus again,0
still going strong as day i got it >>>>love it,0
Amazing computer works well for school and is convenient using the touch screen.,0
all it works happy for the price,0
"Have been using for a month, and this thing is such a beast. That being said, the armoury crate button sometimes doesnt work when unplugged due to unknown reason and that is quite annoying even though i am not using it very oftenAnyway im enjoying the laptop",0
"I read that this would work great for school and college, which is what I needed it for, but it had so little processing power that it would lag when I wrote in Microsoft Word. If I had more than 2 tabs open lagging would begin. I knew that it wouldn't be as powerful as my old computer, but it drove me crazy. The laptop was like new though and it looked nice. The screen was pretty dim, but I don't need to use it outside so that wasn't a problem. I really wanted to like it, but I couldn't get past not being able to do HW that required several tabs to open at once.",0
"I ordered this laptop like new but when I received it it was covered in crumbs and the top right corner of the screen is bent in like it was dropped. There's also a scratch across the center of the screen. There are also some small scratches on the screen and on the lid. The fingerprint sensor is awful but I expected that. The Norton pop-ups are pretty annoying, hopefully they'll go away when my trial is up. The laptop runs pretty well and is good enough for me to do school work on. I guess my biggest complaint is the damage. The crumbs were gross and inconsiderate but I got most of them with some air duster. Aside from a worthless fingerprint sensor, I'd probably be very happy with this laptop if had spent the extra money and bought it new.",0
very slow!!! do not like it,0
This particular laptop made an incredibleamount of fan noise and had to be returned.,0
The card reader did not work. Sent it back a week ago and still no refund. Not good.,0
"The graphics card is removable, providing an easy upgrade path to more powerful graphics capabilities in the future.",1
"I love this Chromebook. The price was great, the screen is nice and large, battery life lasts a long time and it isn't heavy. This works great for school and fits all of my needs. I haven't come across a situation where I needed a PC or different system. I'm very pleased with getting a 2018 model for under $200, especially with the screen size. The speakers are nicer than the last Chromebook model I had as well. I'm very happy with this purchase.",0
"Keyboard would not work correctly, battery drained in less than an hour, with just idling going on, fTPM disabled itself every startup, causing computer to not start without extra interaction. You take your chances with a refurbished comp, and this one was definitely a lemon. Considering other reviews like mine, I suggest you give the refurbished version of what I got, ITB, 8GB RAM, VEGA graphics, etc, a pass.",0
The battery goes pretty quickly,0
Where's thr charger? How do I use a product that doesn't even come with everything it's supposed to. I read some other reviews and other customers get a charger. This is unacceptable,0
Love that it's so small it makes it easy to bring around,0
"I'm on my third wifi card. The Realtec cards are a known issue. I've had to send this back twice since I bought it. Had it two months and haven't been able to use it yet.Update: Finally got them to send me an Intel card that I replaced myself. Solved the problem. BUT, new problems. There are residual windows left on screen after that program has been minimized. E.g., when it wakes, on the desktop will be a window for ""suggested contacts"" from a closed Outlook window. Sometimes will go away by trying to change resolution, but other times has to reboot.This is my 4th Lenovo. Never had a problem before, but am hesitant to buy again from them.",0
Haven't been able to use it for anything,0
"I bought two of these for school work. The quality was good (as expected by Asus), the computer is snappy, and the price was right.",0
I have had this laptop for a few months now and it works perfectly. Runs great,0
Lightweight and convenient,0
it has a mode where it will use 50% of the battery and then start to charge to prolong battery life.,0
Overall a great labtop. I haven’t seen Pixels this nice since I was a kid. Only thing I spent hours figuring out is fixing the screen flickering. You have to keep Virtual Super Resolution and GPU scaling on. You will find them in the Radeon Software app that comes with the pc. Also keep your drivers and OS updated.,0
Equipo básico para estudiante. Suficiente para tarea básicas a intermedias.,0
Good laptop for it's msrp of sixteen hundred dollars. I've seen it being sold for more which is why it gets 3 stars instead of 5. At the prices I've seen on this site it isn't good value for the money.,0
"This laptop served me well for the time it lasted (a very short time!). From December 2017 to November 2018, the laptop worked fine until it suddenly died. It would not turn on no matter what I did. After I sent it in and waited around 3 months for a replacement (even though they said the average turnaround time is 7-10 days), I received my new laptop. It was actually a newer model with a touchscreen (hooray!, or so I thought)After only 4 months of use, the replacement laptop's screen died. I am writing from this laptop, although looking at a monitor plugged in via HDMI. Essentially, I need a desktop monitor or TV to be located wherever I am to use this laptop (kinda destroys the point of a laptop). I fear another component of this machine will break down, so I'll be replacing it with a new laptop from a different company. It definitely won't be another ASUS laptop for me.Stay away from these ASUS laptops! Although I will say the desktop computer GPUs and motherboards they make are significantly higher quality :)",0
Does what it is suppose to do and does it very well . I would give it five stars if not for all the unwanted software. Handles Photoshop and Lightroom like a dream.,0
"I've only had this for 2 years, and it constantly crashes randomly and gives me the blue screen of death. The chasis is not durable and the screen WILL flex if put in a backpack with textbooks. The thermals are terrible; it gets very hot when I place my finger on the metal right above the processors, and I suspect poor thermals are partially why this laptop randomly crashes. Even if it's not super hot, it still crashes due to kernel errors, unexpected store exception, etc. (which are given when I get the blue crash screen).",0
"La laptop, es realmente buena, tal y como se muestra en la descripción.El procesador y el SDD hacen que sea un maravilla el utilizarla con windows 11. (si se instala windows 10 los drivers, dejan de funcionar), pero realmente vale la pena, el almacenamiento es limitado, si no se instalaran juegos pesado o muchos esto no seria un tema.La velocidad con la que abre los programas es increíble... android studio, visual studio emuladores de android, maquinas virtuales y demás cosas para programar es increíble la forma en que los abre y compila.Aplicaciones normales que mas puedo decir al instante.La velocidad con la que se inicia la computadora no es de mas de 13segundos en iniciar colocar contrase?a y ya estar manipulando el sistema.Las únicas pegas que le daría al equipo son justo el almacenamiento, y que la salida de aire del ventilador es justo por debajo de la pantalla, eso me causa cierto temor a que se da?e con el tiempo la pantalla.",0
"So far, after 5 weeks, I'm pleased. Item is as described... no noticeable blemishes or damage and everything works as expected.",0
"I'm a fortysomething female who is sick of lugging heavy things around, including laptops. I did a lot of research before purchasing this machine. It came down to this one versus the HP Spectre 360. I ended up going with this one because it was slightly less expensive. I've owned it nearly a year now and I have no regrets. It powers up incredibly quickly, the battery lasts a good long while - I'd say 6 to 8 hours online or doing power point. It's extremely lightweight, which I love. I bought a minimalist case for it and when I wear it across my body, I sometimes forget I'm wearing it. I haven't had any problems with the machine overheating or the fan being loud. The only design issue I'd flag is that the screen doesn't bend as far back as I'd like it to. More noticeable if I'm using my machine on the subway and need a bit more distance between me and the screen. Otherwise, no complaints.",0
"Estaba feliz de poder volver a comprar una ASUS, y si bien la calidad de la batería es óptima, el diseño es hermoso, la velocidAd está muy bien, falla el teclado y no funciona la Tecla T. La verdad es que no sé qué hacer porque la necesito para trabajar.",0
Perfect business laptop. Flawless. No sense to own anything heavier,0
"Literally the best laptop I've ever owned, I love it. It is perfect for my needs as a college student who does some light gaming and always has about 20 tabs opened. With my old laptop every time I turned it on it was like an old man waking up from a nap and was super laggy, but this laptop is lighting fast. It is also lightweight and has amazing battery life. Plus, the fingerprint reader is an awesome touch.",0
"I love the build quality, the screen, the keyboard. Ports are ok.I bought this as a mobile workstation and it does the job pretty well. I know not to expect a lot from a tiny laptop, so I don't.So far, my only complaint is that the fan gets REALLY loud under load (during a call when I was not using my headphone mic, my colleagues asked me to turn off the vacuum cleaner).",0
Geat laptop,0
"Like the title says, it can play star citizen. I got the one with gtx 1650, i5-9300H, and 8gb ram. I have a ram upgrade arriving tomorrow but I got the laptop today, installed and booted it up and in a city was getting steady 30fps, with some minor frame rate drops here and there but it is absolutely playable. I feel if it can handle Star citizen it can handle just about any game you throw at it.",0
"Had this laptop for about 6 months. Fans are loud as an jet engine but after undervolting CPU with turbo disabled and underclock GPU, it's not that loud. Its just about right.While playing ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,"" at high settings when undervolted and underclocked, temperatures for CPU reach about 64 max and 73 max for GPU. Even with turbo disabled I don't notice much of performance lost and still getting around 100 to 120 fps.Other than that, no problems so far.",0
"My wife and I love this laptop! We are almost happy that our old Lenovo with Windows7 finally stopped working. It is easy to use, light weight and portable. The display is older technology but is totally usable.We both love that it is not Microsoft Windows.",0
Great buy... Product met the need.,0
"I upgraded from having an Asus flip book from 2014 to this. I am very pleased with it so far. I play the Sims 4 with all expansion/game/stuff packs including mods and cc. No lag. Game starts up instantly, move worlds instantly. The screen quality is pretty nice.The only con of this product is how hot amd loud it gets. I had it running on Turbo and I went to use the bathroom, I walked back into my room with my brother from down the hall standing over my desk staring at my computer trying to figure out where and what that sound is. After recovering from a near heart attack from his surprise appearance, I quickly informed him it was my laptop. My friend, who also has this laptop, got herself a cooling tray and said it helped instantly. So I guess that's another cost to consider when purchasing this laptop.",0
"Couple weeks ago I requested to return my Asus G15 Advantage laptop in favor for this one, which is the ASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 with i9-12900h CPU and Nvidia 3070-ti GPU. However, they sent me a used one! I chose to buy the brand new one, but they sent me a used one without its original packaging, etc. The Asus G15 Advantage laptop I got about 3 weeks ago was brand-new in its original, sealed packages with serial codes and everything, etc. I think the Asus Scar here is low on quantity; that’s probably why I got a used one, but even then I shouldn't have paid full price for a used one.Of course, I called Amazon and settled on a discount on the promise that I can't send this one back. However, I still have the full manufacturer's warranty and the 2 years warranty I purchased along with this laptop. I don't know, I like Asus laptops but I don't like getting screwed over. That's the reason for the 3 stars. This laptop runs really well and likely better than the Asus G15 Advantage laptop with the AMD 6800M GPU.",0
I switched from a Chromebook to a windows laptop and I hated it. Every time I closed the lid meant I had to wait for a couple of minutes to turn back on. Chromebooks come on instantly. So that is why I bought this one. I chose this HP because my daughter has the same one and it works great for her.,0
"Great laptop, light and easy to use. Still compatible with all the software I used for Window 7.",0
The ability to remotely lock this laptop adds an extra layer of security that is very reassuring.,1
Hard drive had problems. After 3 days of owning the screen went out.,0
I just use my laptop for work purposes,0
This thing was junk.Stopped working twice in a 6 week period.Returned and new one was shipped and that one crashed in a couple weeks too.,0
"the audio on this PC has a mind of its own. it connects to my air pods when they are closed in a far away room. during zoom meetings, it will randomly stop working and i cant hear anything. the camera is not to clear either.the two finger scrolling is not too great either. again, on some days it will be ok and then on some it will start scrolling when im not even touching it!other than that it is ok, for normal computer functions, but not worth 600$",0
"I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this is a big ticket item for most people.I have nothing bad to say regarding the particular XPS 9500 unit I received with a couple of caveats...The Bad:Similar to other reviewers, I suspect this product is not ""NEW"" as described but rather returned and/or refurbished. It came in a rather torn up box which was simply sealed with regular packing tape. It was shipped to Amazon from a company that appears to be an authorized reseller/or refurbishing center as far as I could tell from a quick Google search. The box had certainly been around the block a time or two, LOL.Given the price point and specs, I'm not surprised if it is a ""refurb, open box, return, etc."" I'm only surprised that Amazon sells them at a steep discount but describes as ""NEW"". I could be way off base here, and perhaps Dell ships most of their products in beat up boxes, and I'm just unaware of it.The Good:I know the above sounded very critical, but bear with me. Once I opened the outer box, the inner Dell box was pristine. Everything was nicely packaged and appeared brand new. The usual protective plastic peel off, unwrap, etc. stuff was all there on everything. There wasn't a fingerprint or speck of dust to be found. Even smelled ""like new"". So...I figured I'd give it a go. Set it up and everything seemed fine, so I opened it up and upgraded memory to 64gb. Everything internally looked new to my untrained eye as well. I've been using it for several days with no issues. Overall, I personally am happy for the price, but if these aren't truly ""new"", I think description should reflect that.Considerations:My laptop before this one was an XPS 15 2012 or 2013 model. It originally had Windows 8 on it FWIW. I had upgraded to SSD, switched to Win10, maxed out RAM, and replaced battery over the years...Just so you know my basis for comparison.Other reviews on both Amazon and online mention crackling speakers and faulty trackpads with this model. My experience has been that speakers sound as good as any laptop I've ever heard, and trackpad is slightly less sensitive in top corners but otherwise fine (I never would have noticed trackpad thing except for online reviews had me looking for faults.) I personally find the speakers and trackpad perfectly fine. Another criticism has been loud fan noise when laptop is trying to cool. It doesn't bother me because my old XPS sounds like a turbo spooling up when it's under a load too! Maybe other brands are quieter, IDK. Fan noise wasn't a big concern of mine.Perhaps mine was a return/refurb that had faults addressed, I just got lucky and got a good unit, or the faults aren't as bad as they are made out to be with this model. I can't say for certain, but that's my experience thus far and honest review.",0
"This is most likely a great idea for someone who wants to work in Chrome all of the time. However, I did not understand the concept when I purchased it. It did not meet my needs because I have files that need to be opened from Open Office. It would not read them. I have several tablets that allow me to access Chrome so this did not meet my needs. Also found it annoying that there is no delete key.",0
Fastest lightest and quietest laptop I have ever had. Very fast start up with face recognition. Very Happy with purchase,0
chromebook stopped working and only had for 8 months,0
I like the look and speed of this laptop but I don't like the keyboard.,0
"First the good...Great keyboard, thin, respectable graphics, love that it's a high res touchscreen.Then the shortcomings...- Yes, I know it's flagship, and thin, but still would like to have had at least one USB-A connector.- Doesn't take smaller chargers. I have a super small 30W charger I like to travel with. My MBP will not complain and during use, will not drain as fast if connected and take its time charging when not being used. The Dell XPS will just say ""no"".- gets hotter than I would like and fans not as quiet as what I would expect from a flagship laptop (expert opinion).- I'm trying to think of a product I have in my house with a camera that is worse than this one... and for the life of me, I can't come up with one. This includes an old Samsung phone, a generic Chinese tablet, and a 6 year old, base model, sub $400 Lenovo Flex 3 I bought on sale. I just can't believe it's this bad. I just assumed that a flagship laptop purchase would have an impressive camera and had I known it was this bad, I would definitely have bought something else. Unfortunately in today's world and because of the apps we use, camera quality is now a top priority on laptops and pushes this laptop to the bottom of any consideration list. The Dell XPS15 9500 (2020) camera plain sucks. Light, bright light, low-light: the only safe-for-work adjective I have for it is: sucks. The camera ruins it for the whole laptop. Assume you don't have one. I have yet to try the reinstall driver recommendation I read on Dell's website post, but I'll try that... I regret not doing my usual research and due diligence in comparing products and reading reviews before making this (very expensive) purchase. :(",0
"I'm not a gamer, so I can't judge for that. I use my Chromebook for ZOOM, for shopping, for research, and for videos. I have a PC I use when I want to print something, but for everything else I use my Chromebook every day. It's much easier to operate than Windows 10. This is my third Chromebook. The other two I gave away to someone who needed one. I like it much better than Windows 10 and I like the price. I can go six hours or so on a charge.",0
"Product is very good for almost anything including gaming, editing, and photo editing but man does the battery die fast, the battery last a total of an hour for me gaming without the charger on best performance but I can get about another hour of crappy gaming on best battery life. VERY GOOD BUY but the battery does suck.",0
"This laptop is really great for everyday regular gamer. It may not be the top of the line but it also doesn't cost you to go broke to buy one. For its price of 1k, it's very fair and offers ton of value. GPU is more than adequate to handle most games. I play Fallout 4 on high graphics and it runs very smooth. It can run RDR 2, GTA, Farcry etc. The Ryzen processor is really powerful and I think it beats intel from analysis video I saw on YouTube. Overall, really great laptop. I don't go hardcore on all the advanced technicalities like overclocking, etc. Just simple gamer who likes good graphics. I recommend Legion 100%",0
Very good laptop for gaming and general use. My only complaint would be the speaker volume is a little on the underwhelming side. Very solid otherwise.,0
Sold my gaming desktop for personal reasons and decided to get a laptop that I can game but also take with me for work purposes.Wished Asus would given more in the package like a computer bag or an accessory tho.But it's perfect,0
"Good laptop works fast, starter laptop for sure if you want something in that price range I would go with this",0
SUPER LIGHT! But I don’t think this is a touchscreen and if it is mine DOES NOT WORK!,0
"Received this laptop as a birthday gift from my wife. Wanted to get something that would allow me to play the latest games without lag and replace my old laptop that had a failing keyboard. I use my computers for hours on end and have put this through it's paces. For the price (especially considering the cost of things going up) this has been great.Also received 2 game downloads and a laptop sleeve, which are a nice bonus. It's almost unheard of in this economic climate for additional things to be added to a purchase.I'm 99% satisfied with the speed, features, fans, look of the computer. My biggest issues which knock it down to 4.5 stars are the smaller hard drive; really anything less than 1tb is brutal given how big media is now. Yes I realize the cloud is a thing, but frankly I hate it and don't trust using it. It does the space to slot in more storage and I broke down and did (easy process, took 5 min)The other issue is the volume. Yeah laptops aren't known for their sound, most of the laptops I've purchased I always paid for an upgraded sound card or when building my own would upgrade the sound card. It's not an issue when listening to everything, but occasionally a video or game will be noticeably quieter than I would like at max volume.All in all though, especially for this price, the laptop is a great. I expect to get a few years out of it and have no issue thus far. To close this is probably the nicest laptop I've ever had. The keyboard lights, the light on the back of the laptop, nice sleek lines. Hopefully my kids don't start popping the keys off of this laptop like my kids did to my old Alienware.",0
"Se hecho a paredes el disco duro a los 38 días de uso , lo malo que solo tiene garantía por 30 días , en general la carcasa se ve de plástico de mala calidad",0

It's a great laptop but it's loaded with Windows 10 and won't let you install anything except from the store and you need to buy apps from the store. That let me down,0
"Great specs, got this for our child but needed enough spec to properly program and maintain it. Works great, very fast , thin and light weight. The only complain is the screen quality but this is something on all Asus brands, they use a matte light screen that looks faded at the slightest angle. BUT, for the price it's good.",0
OPERATING SYSTEM FAR ABOVE MY NEEDED REQUIREMENTS.,0
"Very light , long battery life and fast processing",0
"If you are like me who have been wondering which laptop is bang for your buck. I would say this laptop pretty much fits the description. If you are here then you are looking for a gaming laptop. I’ve done some research and comparisons and this laptop came out on top a lot. First, this laptop games like any console if not better. The video quality, my god it’s amazing. 2070 RTX graphics, 10th gen I-7 for $1399 (the price I bought it at currently) is damn solid.Second, the laptop it self looks solid sleek like a gaming laptop. The curvature and cuts are nice, it is a bit heavy. But hey that’s what a solid PC will get you. Includes cool looking RGB light up keyboard that you can customize.In addition, the laptop has a lot of fans to keep your laptop cool. (You can actually see through all the fans)Downsides:The battery life kind of sucks, but that can always be upgraded.It weighs a bit.The fan noise makes it feel like the laptop is about to hover off the table.So I say, stop struggling to look and research for a laptop. Get this one while it’s still a good deal.",0

"It arrived beautifully packed, and felt incredibly good to hold.",0
its absolutely confortable to type on and very customazible,0
"Touchscreen not important to me, but the BIOS security is so irritating that I haven't yet installed Linux. It IS possible, but it's a PITA if you haven't done it before. However, if you're looking for a laptop that's both capable and inexpensive in a Windows 10 environment, this is a good choice",0
Luv it very much,0
AMDs APU combined with the 2-1 format provides a great mixture of speed and versatility.,0
"Trackpad, keyboard and battery life are great. There's some backlight bleed, but unless you plan on doing work at night with all the lights off AND have the screen brightness at maximum, you wouldn't be able to tell it's there. The keyboard flex everyone is worried about is negligible too. But, don't get this laptop if you just want to game on it. Games like Overwatch, Dota 2, CS:GO and LoL are fine, but not AAA titles unless you're willing to drop the settings to medium.",0
It is great as described. Not made for gaming. I don't really use touch screen.,0
Email,0
My husband uses this daily. It is very fast and he can share and upload real estate docs fast. He went from a windows 10 laptop and he is happy with this model. Very fast and can add a lot of programs if he needs to. I don't know if he will add microsoft office later.,0
"I do not use it often but when I do need it I am forced to sit through downloads (can't do much else with it using all its processor speed for that) then, when THAT'S done I have to wait out the restarts and installations of the ""new"" stuff.Perhaps I am just getting old and grumpy but I do not remember my previous laptops being so needy.",0
the speakers occasionally don't work without headphones unless I shutdown and restart.,0
great services ! i got my new Gaming Laptop real fast! i love it! thank u amazon,0
Got the i9 3070ti version for 1.2k. Decent specs for the price. Thermal is much improved comparing to G15. Able to run 2k game at highest setting smoothly. 16:10 monitor is also good for productivity task. Only downside is one ssd slot but can't ask for more at this price point.,0

"I'm not impressed with this machine, especially at the price it's listed. I paid far less than this for my HP Spectre and it's a higher quality machine. Functionally everything works but it's like comparing a Lamborghini to a Datsun. Both ""work"" but which would you rather use? The bezel and body on my HP are far superior. They are prettier and feel better to use. This Dell doesn't feel much different than my acer chromebook. It doesn't perform any better than the chromebook either.Overall it works but doesn't convey any features to me that deserve the price and that's important to me. I dislike unnecessarily overpriced products.",0
Fast internet connection. Large 15 inch screen. Getting familiar with windows 11. I think I got a good deal for black Friday specials on this computer.,0
the computer has an AI Widget that continuously opens up and runs despite me closing it down,0

Good value for money. Had it for some months and I don't have any complaint.,0
I must admit I’ve only used it twice since purchasing but it has everything I need I love it. Just need to transition from my old laptop... timing. Soon I will get to it.Changed the start to 1 Star. See my additional review.It's LOUD......mechanical sounds going alllll day and night. Soooooooooooooooooooooooo slowwwwwwwwww.. NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR MY BUSINESS. I want to return it for a refund/exchange. The numlock key keeps turning off by itself. I think it was refurbised honestly. I HATE IT!,0
"Further Update 4-5-2021: At the current price of $748, I think you can do better than this. I spent about that much including an additional 16MB RAM, for a total of 24MB, and an additional 1TB SSD. But I'm happy I got it and if the price drops back down to around what I paid before the upgrades, $599, it still seems like a good deal.UPDATE 3-24-2021: I had to send my desktop unit in for repair about a month ago. That took about two weeks because it got stuck in transit when Texas got closed down by bad weather, and I had to use the laptop as my primary computer during that time. I connected it to my graphics monitor via the HDMI port, plugged a powered USB hub running four external hard drives, my graphics tablet and my webcam into one USB port, and used the other two USB ports for a card reader and wireless mouse. So, pretty much maxed out all the connectivity options including the ethernet port. Obviously I was not running all this off the battery.Other than time-wasting, I mostly use the computer for photo editing. The images are from a full-frame camera so the files are quite large to start and I often enlarge them. Editing uses a lot of memory and CPU/GPU juice. I had added 16GB of memory when I got the machine, which came in handy. As one would expect, the laptop didn't perform as well as the souped-up desktop does: everything took longer and it got frustrating at times. I wished I had added a larger SSD, which I've now done (another $100, bringing the total including the additional memory up to about $750). Ultimately, though, I got everything done that needed doing and I'm still impressed with the machine. It may be outdated already, I haven't looked, but I'm happy with the purchase and it definitely kept me sane while the desktop was gone, which my old laptop would not have done.This is a preliminary review of the Nitro 5 with the 9th Gen Intel Core i5-9300H and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650. I've had the machine for two weeks now. I paid $600 and dropped an additional $50 on a 16gb RAM stick, for a total of 24gb. I bought it because it was the least expensive unit I could find with a discrete GPU. I wanted something I can use for basic photo editing when I travel or when I feel like sitting in a cafe for a while, because I'm an optimist who believes both those things will be routine again some day. I'm not a gamer and can't speak to its capabilities for that.First the things I don't like:1) the keyboard. The keys are serviceable but a bit mushy. I prefer a more clicky keyboard but that's really a matter of taste and not function, and after two weeks I've adjusted to it. It's a good size, not cramped, and has a full-sized numerical pad. What I really don't like is that it's basically unusable in the daytime without the backlight turned up most of the way, and the backlight goes off when you pause typing for a few seconds, presumably to save battery. I don't understand that design decision. If you really want to save battery, make a keyboard that you can see without the backlight on. And the shift functions on the keys don't stand out that well even with the backlight. Maybe it's a gaming aesthetic thing, but I don't like it.2) The touchpad. It's just not very accurate. Moving between open tabs on a browser or trying to select tools in Photoshop or Lightroom and related plugins is a pain. I just use a mouse. I don't know what gamers use touchpads for but I can't imagine they'd like this one very well.3) Battery life. With the GPU idle, just using the unit for browsing, email and some writing, I got a bit more than five hours on a charge. When I started doing some moderately intensive photo editing involving the GPU, battery life dropped dramatically. If you're doing anything CPU/GPU intensive for any length of time you'll most likely want to keep it plugged in.4) Webcam. If I'm home I'm using my desktop webcam, and if I'm out I'm using my phone. The one on the unit is sort of a disaster. I guess that's where they're saving money. I would think anybody using the computer for Zoom or to stream would want to use an external USB one.5) Weight. This is a chonky fellow. I took it in my camera backpack on a shoot involving a lot of walking and noticed the extra couple pounds over the laptop it replaced. Not a big issue, though.6) Audio. The speakers are muddy and weak. You'll want to use headphones for music or gaming. It comes with Waves Maxx Audio, which I use on my desktop, but no amount of equalizing or enhancing is going to save these speakers. I expect nothing from laptop audio in this price range, and I got it.The keyboard backlight is the most aggravating of all those concerns for me. Classic example of form over function. Battery life is second, the touchpad third, and the webcam fourth. None of the issues come close to being deal breakers.Things I like:1) Performance. This is a $600 laptop with a decent four-core processor and a discrete GPU. Would I like an i7 or better and the RTX 2060? Sure. Do I want to pay another $500 or more for them? Why no: no I do not. It moved along pretty well right out of the box, and and with the inexpensive RAM upgrade it positively zips. Again, I can't speak to the gaming capabilities, but I'm really pleased with the performance for my needs. I'll have to add some storage at some point, as I expect many people will, but that's pretty inexpensive these days too.2) Construction: as the weight would indicate, this thing is solid. Despite the plastic body, nothing about it feels cheap. There's not much flex to the screen. The only thing I don't like about it is that the back is a solid piece that has to be completely removed to upgrade the RAM or the drives. It'd be nice if it had access panels for those. Prying it apart was anxiety-inducing. You should note there's an included SSD cable but it's not installed and it's tiny so put it somewhere safe and install it the first time you have the back off.3) The screen. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the brightness and accuracy. I did some work on a few pics that I then looked at on my graphics monitor, which cost more than this machine, and the colors were pretty much right on. I can't speak to it for gaming purposes, the frame/refresh rate is more or less irrelevant to me, but it's better than I expected for what I'm doing with it.4) Heat management. This is exceptional. The chassis is built to dissipate heat, and the two fans work really well, independently of one another, and quietly. Acer provides a heat management utility that allows the user to manually control the fans and to keep track of the processor temperatures. I've used the laptop as an actual laptop for up to two hours without appreciable discomfort.5) Bloatware. There's hardly any, and the Acer utilities are actually useful. I had to get rid of the preinstalled Norton Security and Microsoft Office trials but that's an easy job.6) Appearance. It's fine. It has the sort of angular, aggressive styling that seems to be de rigueur for gaming, and in this instance the styling incorporates the heat dissipation features so it's functional as well. I'd prefer something other than black but it's fine.7) Ports. It has an HDMI out, 2 USB 3.0, a USB-C, a USB 2.0, an ethernet port, an earphone jack and of course a power input. Pretty good collection. You can get by without Thunderbolt ports.tl;dr: As you would expect from a machine at this price point, Acer made some compromises. The camera and speakers are subpar, and the unit is mostly plastic. They also made some design decisions that are borderline incomprehensible to me, as with the keys not showing up well in good light without the backlight. The heat handling is great, the screen performance is better than I expected, it's fast and powerful, and I'm still surprised at getting even an entry-level GPU at this price. For a non-gamer using it as a photo editing and general purpose laptop, the value seems exceptional.",0
Battery life sucks. Charger length is super short. It's compatible with the Surface Pen which is cool. Not a heavy laptop.,0
"Purchased the laptop new from Amazon and received with a faulty power adapter (barrel plug is malformed). Immediately registered on Acer's website, followed their service request process to file a claim and began setting up the laptop. Had a full charge on the battery so I spent several hours on setting up the laptop, expecting that getting a replacement power adapter would be no big deal. Online chat to contact Acer support is completely offline for days at this time.Several days later, I receive an automated email that Acer is unable to complete my request for repair and that my next course of action is to contact the reseller. Should return the laptop to Amazon, undoing hours of work setting it up and maybe getting a replacement? Shame on Acer for complicating getting a working power adapter. At this point I'm ordering a replacement A/C adapter and remembering the poor warranty support experience before purchasing more Acer equipment.",0
The product came in as advertised. The chrome book is very light and holds the battery charge for a very long time. very convenient for my middle schooler specially during these days of virtual classes.,0
Hands down the best laptop I’ve ever had,0
Great quality. System is a huge upgrade from my old laptop. The only thing that I recommend is getting a good sized M.2 SSD and installing it since the SSD already installed is only half a terabyte.,0
"when opening the screen one-handed, the bottom half (more or less) stays flat on the table.",0
I am totally in love with the laptop!! It works perfectly!! The quality of the Laptop is amazing.,0
"I'm gonna put these in bullets points for easier read.Pros:1. Slim profile for 17inch gaming laptop2. Customizable RGB keyboard3. Beautiful 120Hz display4. Eventhough it's TN panel, the color displayed is awesome.5. Speedy performance. Power up in less than 10seconds.6. High FPS in game with max graphics quality setting.7. A lot of ports.8. Metal-like surface. Best of ROG gaming laptop design so far.9. Great specs at low price.Cons:1. Noisy fan when fan booster is turned on.2. Low battery life.3. Keys around numpad area is too cramped.4. Keyboard palm rest area is made of rubber-like material prone to attract greasy fingerprints.5. Battery is not easily accessible.Overall, it's a very affordable powerful gaming laptop that you can consider buying. Apart from the noisy fan and low battery life, this laptop is the best choice. ;)Check out my unboxing and review videos on my YouTube channel at ""Eden's Corner"".",0
You should put windows on the laptop,0
Cant add apps,0
I am having a lot of fun designing keyboard light layouts,0
Gaming is awesome on this pc it plays alot of games with no lag. This laptop is the computer is the best I've had it runs well I play fps games like rainbow tarkov and dayz and it runs beautiful nice screen it works fast and it's efficient and it's durable it runs games with no issues.,0
"Great gaming laptop, but the Hard Drive is too small. I'm already at 80% full with just a few games loaded.",0
"I'm enjoying the way the features are so easy to use. My friend is always struggling with pop ups and stuff that misdirects his searches. Being online with google service is so much easier for me, no re-directs or virus stuff.",0
"Como lo dije en el titulo, simplemente espectacular, todo perfectamente, el producto llego en perfectas condiciones ademas de que venia bien embalado, muy satisfecho con este producto y el vendedor. (Tras 2 semanas de uso)",0
like everything. use it for everything,0
Good,0
Great producr,0
I'm really impressed with this laptop. When reading the reviews I was a little worried about it but I knew it wouldn't be like a regular windows based laptop. I wanted something smaller that I can travel with. It has completely met my expectations for what I wanted.,0
"i got this for my mom because her laptop was getting slow, easy to use, works great, great price, she's happy, i'm happy.",0
"Fine for gaming, but in graphics intensive games it runs hot enough to burn skin after 5 minutes. A $20 cooling pad has solved this issue.",0
This is a great computer. It comes loaded with Killer. Crazy fast. It came packaged correctly so that it was not damaged. I have had trouble with this in the past when ordering electronics online. Believe the reviews and the hype.,0
the graphics just look amazing while I play Overwatch and WoW,0
"First turn on seemed ok, later that same day could not open software. I restarted computer and it would not enter usable state. Used once with difficulty, then returned it.",0
This laptop performs extremely well. when plugged in your gaming performance is what you would expect for the hardware. thermals are handled well and by far my favorite thing the panel. it has great colors and brightness. very sharp. the darks are not great but that's more to do with backlight and panel type.The keyboard layout is a bit strange to me and I make a bit of mistakes pressing the control key instead of shift but this is something I expect to train my way through.,0
"easy to use and transfer favorites over with chrome account, fast down loads , if you are old like me purchase this product for traveling or home use, Thanks Amazon!!!!!!!!!!",0
"fast, ""Smooth"" operating, good speakers. Touchpad a little sensitive even with 'toning' it down.",0
"After countless hours updating bios, updating drivers, undervolting underclocking the computer was unable to utilize a full performance on games because it was THERMAL THROTTLING LIKE HELL",0
Perfect product for the easy computer tasks! It's quick and easy to navigate.It does a lot for it's size!,0
"The computer was good looking and pretty responsive. The screen had a sharp image. But that's as far as I got. I had the computer running a total of about 1 1/2 hours when it put up a blue screen and froze! Will I get another HP? I'd like to think this is ""one-in-a-million"" but I do get dubious.",0
no full size keyboard,0
It is a decent computer but it doesn't do as much as I thought it would.,0
"CPU doesn't bottleneck the GPU almost at all, this is about as good as a desktop RTX 2060.Keyboard is incredible, feels great, and the lighting is awesome. I had to reinstall the the steelseries engine to get the keyboard control to work, but eventually I got it.I would recommend to undervolt the cpu, as it does get hot, and undervolting it wont decrease the speed by much.The screen for me is amazing, almost no light bleed around the edges and really good colors.I'm not impressed by the speakers, they are loud, but tinny and have no bass and little mids. But I'm going to use a headset anyway because of the loud fans when playing high-demanding games.Main con is how absolutely BEASTLY the power adapter is, it's at least 3 pounds, so not good if you plan on moving this thing around a lot.Overall, it's really good for the price, with exceptional build quality. 9/10",0
"Company could not offer a replacement battery NOR would they offer a credit. My only option was to clear laptop, return and invest the time setting up another device. Would never order from this company again.",0
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is the worst computer I've ever owned. I am returning it immediately. Setup was easy with Cortana, but slow. It took forever to boot up just to start doing anything. Launching the internet felt worse than dial-up. The internet application (Windows Edge, I think) froze while typing an email, and I had to restart the computer. I had a full wifi connection - so it was the application - not my internet speed. I used it for less than an hour and was so frustrated that I started the return process with Amazon (on my wife's MacBook Pro). It's taken over an hour to only complete ""3% of the factory reset"". I only completed setting up my mail account on this laptop, nothing else -- so the restoration to factory settings should only take seconds. Do not buy this computer.",0
"I've own 3 Dell laptops and would never have thought to buy another brand, however the day that I was due to purchase a new Dell, this Acer flashed up on my 'Amazon Treasure Truck' deals and I believed it was a sign. I'm so happy I bought it! A great deal! A great laptop! and boy am I happy! The only 'con' is it's not touchscreen but the 'pros' out balance this and are also too numerous to mention!!",0
Bought this to use at work instead of lugging my huge laptop. Have not set it up yet but should be fairly easy with a flash driveMy job is going online so am waiting to see what the other nurses like about the program. Let them work the bugs out but this smaller computer will be light and easy when I dive in.,0
"It runs The Sims, Magic, Adobe illustrator, and steam games without any lag. My siblings use it for remote learning and have no complaints. Not too big, not too small. I'm very happy with this. Battery is decent, if I'm browsing the internet I'll get 6-7 hours, if I'm gaming or using zoom I'll get around 4.",0
seems to be made of a cheaper material,0
The wifi settings disappeared and i thought i was crazy until i had my coworker look and she notice the wifi setting wasnt there either. This laptop was defective. I returned it the very next day.,0
"I would leave 0 stars if I could. Had this laptop for five months, was very satisfied overall with it’s performance. Until today I hooked it up to my tv via hdmi to watch Netflix, I noticed the borders were cut off around the edges, no problem I can fix that. I went to ASUS website to download the current display drivers, to allow me to run the Intel Graphics Control System application. I installed the driver ASUS gave me on their site, still couldn’t load the control system. Used windows option to search web for latest drivers, window found drivers and installed them for me. Required a restart. When it restarted the screen was black and I haven’t been able to get it to work since. It doesn’t even make it to the windows login page, as evidenced by the lack of caps lock light going on/off. Tried hard resets, not working. Waste of money. Will change review if ASUS or amazon makes this right but I contacted them and they have been of no use. I was very satisfied but now I am very disappointed with my purchase and will not go back to this brand again.",0
"No hubo problemas con el envio, llego muy bien embalado y el funcionamiento de la laptop es optimo.Muy satisfecho!",0
"Love this lap top but it’s ridiculous that it doesn’t have an usb or hdmi, so if you plan to buy MacBooks then get the adapter too. Otherwise you won’t be able to connect your phone to your laptop.",0
I like this laptop. Thank you.,0
"Intel is finally back from the dead with their 10nm processors that can almost compete with the 400lb gorilla in the room AMD. However where Intel has AMD beat is in battery life and onboard graphics.This acer swift 3 is the perfect example of grace and beauty with speed and battery sipping from the new intel chips. There are always going to be trade offs when it comes to laptops. Want the best processor and GPU, than youre sacrificing battery life and compactness. Want great battery life, than youre sacrificing speed and GPU power. To be frank its always going to be this way as thats just the state of things. More power equals the need for more...well power! The trick when getting a laptop is to find that happy medium that accomplishes all your goals without giving and taking too much. However with the advent of new chips that valley of distance between the two is narrowing. The intel 11th gen processors with the new XE onboard graphics are leaps and bounds better than any previous intel chip. The processor core provides a lot of power when you need it and uses very little power. The XE onbaord graphics are in a different league than Intels previous onboard video junk. It performs better than AMD's on board graphics immensely as well. The beauty of this is that you really dont need that sesperate power drawing GPU that a lot of laptops have. The onboard graphics are really just that good. Granted you're not going to be playing far cry 6 in 4k with this setup, but if youre doing power user things like making movies, editing video, playing 1080 gaming while on the go than this is a great option. This laptop is easily a desktop replacement too if you have that in mind. I have been using it at home on my 32"" monitor and it works great. Like all things though there are the Pros/ConsPros;-Intel is back with great processors that are incredibly fast and power sipping-Intels build in graphics are almost as good as a separate GPU-Screen is bright and sharp and can easily been seen in broad day light-Build quality is superb-Keyboard is precise and have great scissor keys-Fast NVME drive and ddr4 ram-Incredible battery life, makes my macbook m1 jealous!Cons;-Expensive for newer intel processors (but thats just how things are now in a silicon shortage)-Doesnt come with a case (nit picky thing, but I love custom sleeves that a lop of manufacturers are including now a days-Stickers (I hate stickers on things, and these were especially a pita to remove, not to mention they were on crooked to begin with)All in all you can not find a equal at this pricepoint for what you get and what it provides. Its much faster than my m1 macbook (which doesnt deserve the praise it gets to begin with) its robust and well made with quality metal materials, keyboard is great, screen is fantastic and its battery life has no equal!!",0
Great little computer for my 95 year old aunt.,0
the fans take off like a jet and I get stuck on a black screen,0
"I bought this for my fiance to replace her (absolutely garbage) HP laptop of 4 years. So far she's really loving this!I think it's a really good little machine for its cost, the battery life is pretty nice, the screen is plenty bright, and the overall usefulness is pretty great.I think the speakers are kind of quiet and could bare to be better, and the screen/hinge area feels kind of flimsy at times, but so far it's holding up.There's a beep every time we plug it in to charge or unplug it. Haven't figured out how to turn that off yet, hoping it's an option though.I'm hesitant to give it 5 stars this soon, but so far it's doing good!",0
After 2 months. The sounds on my Acer laptop does not work anymore.,0
"100% satisfied. Solid laptop, with all you need and more for daily use.",0
"I have purchased this Lenovo Legion 5 for 10 days with the price of 1049$ (no tax and shipping fee). My first impression is that this is the best laptop in the price range. However, the battery life is short when you unplug from the electrical source. I think it is desired to buy it (I bought it from Vietnam with global shipping)",0
"I bought a certified referbushed but it must have been like the display model from a shop when I set it up it had a wierd setup process and strange certificate codes from like 2011 im retuturning getting a newer model of chromebook , I suppose you get what you pay for thought a found a good deal since all chrome books are good for is browsing web but this thing is not up to date",0
Problems from the outset...,0
"I got the base 256GB 8GB of ram model and this thing does everything I need it to and more. I consider myself fairly tech savvy, so when I heard all the controversy surrounding this model and its slower SSD, I was a little hesitant. After realizing what I wanted to do with the computer, this become a non-factor. I mostly do school (computer science) a little bit of rendering for my 3d printer and some very light gaming. The SSD has never been an issue in my day to day. If you are editing photos or access large files that will need to be read or written to often, maybe go to the 512GB model to get the faster SSD. If you are not working in CAD or video/photo editing all the time you will not care I promise. The rest of this machine has astounded me. 18 hours of battery life is not just marketing, the speed of the M2 is snappy and can handle much more than I thought it would. The new screen is gorgeous. Trackpad is the best on the market bar none. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever felt on a laptop and is an absolute joy to type on. MagSafe is back and amazing as before. Probably my favorite thing about this laptop, coming from a Windows gaming laptop is the lack of a fan. You will lose a little performance, but not having that noise is absolutely astounding. Cannot recommend this thing enough. Great job Apple.",0
This laptop is really good and it super fast and for the price of it it get the job done is I highly recommended it.,0
"the speakers don't work. It's barely audible 95% of the time, with spikes of regular-volume 5%.",0
"Perfect for school! Fits easily in my backpack, lightweight, and long lasting battery. Fast enough to handle multiple tabs and capable of everything I needed for school",0
If I could have figured out how to clear what we already put on the laptop I would have returned it,0
great........,0
Backlight bled up from the bezel,0
"No problems, Works as stated!",0
Bought this for my dad who needs something simple and this was a great value. Setting up is really easy and he's as haooybas can be. Fast as can be and is perfect for someone that just uses basic internet services. Very pleased.,0
"The laptop just doesn't turn on.I tried removing the battery and holding for one minute the power button, and it didn't help.I called Amazon, and they sent me to Lenovo technical support. Do not buy this item, it will break after a year or so, it's like refurbished!",0
"It has been a great little computer for my teens to use for school, especially for the price; so much so that we bought one for each and a third for my husband's online teaching needs. Being a chromebook, it has its own version of ""Microsoft"" apps. I can't attest to how they function as my kids use Google docs through their school. The interface takes a little getting used to and the Notes app inevitably locks up the computer. But overall it gets the job done. The battery life is actually quite good given you can go almost an entire day without charging (and that's using it almost constantly). BUT it loses a star because the charger has now died on 2 of the 3 units that we purchased less than a year ago.",0
Screen quality is exceptional.,0
La pc cumple lo que esta en el anuncio,0
I don't know where you can get so much power in so sleek-cool package for the price. Hits the ground running with software set-up. Start to deployable for use in about and hour. Windows 10 and Office 365 comes preloaded saving hours of download (yea!)... just add accounts and passwords. Seamless link to existing wireless hardware and drivers.I've purchased 3 ZenBooks. This edition is better integrated with Windows for ease of set-up. I appreciate ASUS's cutting the bloat-ware load.Great value for money. No cons.,0
"It is a reasonable chromebook, but actual battery life is poor: less than 4 hours during home-schooling sessions brand new after being fully charged.",0
The accessory plug ins are really nice on this model with a substantial memory.,0
"I received my new laptop a few weeks ago and must say I love my ZenBook! Super light, super thin, and super fast! I was worried I would have a lot of bloatware (as my Dell came with) but besides a couple of games I could easily delete, it was just right! The fingerprint scanner is nice, but not as good as an iPhone. It doesn’t always read accurately-not a big enough problem to doc a rating from. Overall very pleased.",0
Died in a week!!,0
"I have had a very good experience with the laptop, I highly recommend it to play games, I also use it for work and it is excellent for me.",0
"I am not one to get extremely excited as a consumer, however, this item is pretty amazing. The price and the quality are great. For a mobile gaming experience I would recommend this to my friends and family for sure. This purchase was a gift to me from a good friend and its a major upgrade.",0
The gold looks super sleek and its just overall a beautiful thing.,0
"I got this laptop to primarily play LoL and CS Go. I like this laptop and have been running it hard for a week. One thing to note, it runs REALLY hot to the touch. I mean, I can seriously feel it running at an elevated temperature, even though I'm not running any games or vids on it right now. I don't know if this is normal, and I will continue trying it out for a little while longer, but I'm worried that it's not cooling properly.",0
Amazing laptop,0
Ordered this for our grand daughter. Keeps thanking us for it. Our daughter says it works great for school and home,0
"Computer works for what i need, does not have enough space to perform updates or much of anything else",0
"Es muy rápida en el encendido, aunque tiene poco DDS y Memoria RAM pero su procesador es de ultima generación. Corre los programas sin problema y ya viene con win 11. El envio llego en fecha y en muy bien estado",0
"Worked fine for 83 days. Now, it won't boot. Getting no bootable device error. Go into the boot menu no device appears. shows an empty screen. Acer site won't even recognize SN or SNID. Waiting on Acer to respond. Less than 90 days old and a hassle already.",0
"Overall, it's really nice for the price. My only real complaint is that there is one audio jack that has a menu for five or six different options, I would have preferred separate mic and headphone jacks but it's bearable. I have it, my brother has one, and my friend's brother has one. It's very good quality for the price.",0
Works great. Easy to use.,0
Screen quality is beautiful.,0
As a college student I need something to do my home work access my email and browse the internet ..... If you are like me this is perfect for you ... Very good price,0
HP stopped working. It will not power up or turn on. I purchased it 4 months ago. It cannot be started. Now I am stuck with a broken chromebook.,0
"Best computer i have ever had, very good job Apple. Comparing to many brands HP, Acer, Dell, etc this is a rocket based on price, speed, image, performance, everything. just the best buy you can ever have, dont doubt it for a second.Btw i rarely do reviews for stuff i buy but it deserves it, could not be happier!",0
"Pros: - Really great hardware, 3080 16GB etc- Good price- Has NVME 4.0 and NMVE 3.0 support (1 port each)- Great for gaming- IPs screen looks great- Speakers good- Full size keyboard, wanted to get an ROG ,but skipped on it because of the lack of a keyboardCons: - Bad design- Camera position at the bottom, will show fingers while typing. Should have moved it to the top or removed it and reduce the price.- Power cable on right, should be on left and farthest from user, since most people are right-handed (mouse on right).. looks cleaner- 3.5mm port is in between ethernet cable and USB ports, should be on the last port on the left, nearest to users, not between other ports- Fans can get really loud, but good thing temps stay cool- Keyboard RGB software, (Fusion) always resets to default wave on startup, no fix yet- Aourus software is a bit clunky, hopefully aorus should update, with better UI and UXOverall Review: - For the price, I would definitely recommend it, Wanted to give 4.5 stars ..but its well priced and gets 5 stars- Hopefully, Aourus takes notes and makes future laptops better.",0
"I am new to laptop gaming, I mostly play fallout 3, dark souls, and runescape on this laptop. It runs all of them on high or ultra settings very well.",0
"Resetting the password is a PITA. It's almost as if they dont want you to use it,",0
"I bought this laptop for photo/4K video editing and music production. The price for the specs is crazy. If it's good for gaming, it's good for anything else.Likes: POWER. Scores high on benchmarks. Is fast and snappy in real use. I connected it to my 49"" Samsung Q70R and it ran Death Stranding in 4K on max settings at 70 FPS with DLSS set on Performance.Yes, with V-Sync on, smooth 4K60 is possible on this laptop without turning down eye candy if the game supports DLSS. Without DLSS, it obviously becomes a slideshow, since 3840 x 2160 is a crazy resolution for a modern game even with an RTX 2080 Ti. At 1080p with DLSS set on Quality, FPS get as high as 130s.Dislikes: SCREEN. The black levels are abysmal. It's the worst laptop screen I've ever owned. I thought my 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 was bad. The screen is so thin, just touching the lid shifts the black levels to a greenish hue, and positioning it also causes a shift.The colors are nice, though, and in other than dark scenes, it looks decent. It's not very bright, but it's plenty for daylight use with a window behind. Oh, it came with no dead pixels or bright spots, so that's good! Viewing angles aren't impressive, especially for an IPS panel. I'm so unhappy with the screen, I would return the laptop if it wasn't for the high value, for how gorgeous it looks and how compact it is.Keyboard looks better than it feels. Keys are tight, but could use a more clickety feeling. I'm not into the RGB craze, but I have to admit the light show looks beautiful. My favorite config is Roulette. Mentioning RGB, I built a Ryzen 9 3900X system months ago and the CPU came with an RGB fan. I was annoyed by it at first, but once I changed the stock light show, I can now appreciate how my case is accented.If you're anti-RGB like I was, this MSI laptop has some civilized light schemes. It's not retina-burning lighting. Give it a chance.Battery is just OK for portability when using it for normal tasks. You don't get a powerful gaming laptop with a hexacore i7 10750H and full RTX 2070 to play unplugged from the wall. Makes no sense.Build quality and fit and finish is very nice. It's a budget gaming laptop, but this isn't budget-feeling at all. You just get a plastic case, not machined aluminum.Software-wise, it comes with a Norton antivirus trial, which I promptly deleted. All the other apps are non-intrusive. Whatever bloatware it came with doesn't stick out, but I uninstalled them. I also uninstalled all the MSI apps to rule out any potential funky business/performance issues.It's my first MSI laptop and I highly recommend it. I will revise this review if something bad comes up. I enclosed a few benchmark scores. This thing has a lot of power. It could replace a desktop/tower PC.EDIT - The first thing I did with it was download UserBenchmark just to see how it compared to my Acer Predator Helios 300. The speakers would make a loud popping sound on the Sphere GPU test, invalidating the benchmark and not yielding results.That never happened to me before with my other computers, and made me suspect that it was audio-related, so I stopped and disabled the Nahimic service, and also uninstalled the Nahimic app. That solved the issue and I finally got all my scores.",0
"This is the Second note book I buy The same, like the one I had before,????? WHY cause my friend sat it. And I almost had a HEART ATTACK, I order the same thing again and couldn't be HAPPIER. Why, I guess I never got with it, meaning typing on screen than in real typing keys, had bought notebooks with separating typing keys, and nope I don't know how people can even get used to a phone lo small and the laptops to bulky and simple tablet is ideal for most people but if you want to type with reg keys I would carry mouse key board and tablet. With NOTEBOOK, I only grab it and go, in school we had to take our own laptop back then it was a portable typewriter in 8th and 9th grade.",0

It functions just fine as a computer. But as soon as I got it and updated the drivers the touchpad stopped working. I've tried all sorts of solutions I've found on the internet to fix the situation. I've been given a couple different links to drivers directly on the Lenovo website but they don't fix the issue. Had to buy a usb wireless mouse.,0

"Arrived on time, no problems.I SEVERELY dislike the 'Cortana' app and cannot uninstall it.Besides that, the laptop is just fine.",0
"Great laptop for anyone that wants a portable gaming machine.Great for game development using Unity3D and Unreal Engine.I would recommend finding a good cooling solution as it might help to preserve the laptop for more years of use.I am not saying that temperatures are bad, but it is a gaming computer, so it will get to about 70-90 degrees for the CPU and 70-85 degrees for the GPU while gaming on it.With normal use, like surfing the web and watching shows (Youtube, etc.), the temperatures of the GPU usually do not exceed 60 degrees, and the CPU does not exceed 70 degrees.But of course, it might change a little bit depending on your environment's temperatures.I am using this laptop in a room with an air conditioner, so you should take this into a consideration.Bear in mind, that this laptop doesn't have a camera, in case you need one you will need to buy it separately.",0
I put it in my backpack with the power brick and its heavy.,0
"What a great deal this Legion 5 is. The display is as good as the display on the back of my dslr camera. I am not a gamer so cannot attest to anything gaming related. That being said it is an excellent choice for programs like Adobe Lightroom, Topaz and any of the Luminar software programs. Before I turned my laptop on I upgraded the RAM to 32gb and added a 2TB ssd for storage. The laptop boots to desktop in 10 seconds which I found impressive for the price. Battery performance is poor to say the least and I keep mine plugged in all the time. By poor I would say 3 hours unplugged is pushing it. This laptop is also Windows 11 compatible.",0
"Worked good for a couple months then starting automatically turning right in the middle of me doing homework or playing a game. I'm very annoyed, I heard so much good things about this brand laptop and none of it seems to be true. Maybe I just got a defective one.",0
"The 1 star is for the poor quality control by Acer.I received the laptop and immediately started to set it up. Upon entering my info I noticed that the D key was not working. I put in a call to Acer tech support and have to send the laptop in to get repaired... the brand new out of the box product. Now I have to repackage everything, wait for a shipping label, drop it off and wait 7-10 business days (fancy wording for two weeks) instead of working on projects that I bought the laptop for. So at this point I am very disappointed in Acer’s quality control.I can’t really review the laptop itself since it was defective from the start. I’m hoping that is the only issue with the machine as most reviews I’ve read about the Nitro 5 are positive.Update: It has been 22 days since I received the brand new laptop from Amazon. Acer repair has had the laptop for 14 days now and I still have not received any info about the status of my case other than it is still being repaired. I am not happy about having to wait 3+ weeks to have a brand new working laptop.",0
"This arrived out of the HP box (I purchased a NEW laptop, not refurbished). It was bubble wrapped and placed in a secondary box with the charger and instruction book laying on top. I took a picture and immediately packaged it back up and returned to Amazon. When I purchase a NEW laptop I expect it to arrive in the original manufacturer's sealed box.",0
"I use this for watching movies, TV shows, email, and listening to music.. I love the touch screen I no longer need a mouse and I was so used to using a mouse on my other laptop..",0
"The Laptop is ok, works well and quick. As I opened the camera I was shocked. In the description is the camera described as HD. This is never but never HD. I didn't expect such a bad resolution. I'm extremely disappointed. I wanted to leave only one star because of that. But as the laptop works really well I'm giving 3 stars.Added later: Downgrades to one star because this laptop is very hard on the plastic casing to open and close. The casing broke on it's thinnest places. Don't buy this garbage.",0
Three weeks and the wireless no longer works says to connect an ethernet cable instead; however there's no jack on the computer for one. I won't buy another HP.,0
"First one wouldn't even start. Got a replacement. Now, 14 months later the replacement is dead.Avoid this at all costs.",0
"i’ve had this computer for not even a full year and it’s started to randomly turn off while i’m in the middle of a game. the screen goes back, and i can’t do anything, but the screen is still on because it’s not fully off, there’s light behind it. honestly, for the price, it’s not worth it, just go buy a razer.not only that, but a few months ago the mouse broke for no reason. i don’t violently click and i honestly use the tap-click feature more than i actually press the button, but now i can’t use the trackpad mouse unless i do the tap.",0
I actually did not purchase this item. I was hacked but could not give a bad score because of it. That was Amazons fault.,0
This one does not come with 2.5 SATA cable if you only ordered the ssd version. I consider it a trash move of Asus that you pay 2k cannot even diy. Do not buy the 2060 version,0
"I recently purchased this Acer Aspire laptop when my costly Dell decided to quit. I refused to spend money on another Dell. So I was shopping on Amazon one day and came across this Acer laptop. The reviews were good, and from them, I decided to give this laptop a try. I am SO glad I did! It is everything that the Dell was but at a much lower price. I use it every day and have had NO problems at all. It is lightweight and loads all the apps very fast. Quick charging and is worth every penny.",0
My son loves it. It does everything he wanted from his reviews.,0
"Easy to use , mainly used for research, gmail. MF",0
So far is good no problems,0
"Great product. I bought this laptop to replace my old desktop pc with outdated parts. In current times of ridiculous pc part prices, this laptop really came right when I needed it. It runs most games buttery smooth. I currently have it linked up to my gaming monitor at 144hz and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase.",0
I Wish it came with upgrade options such as 1TB SSD and 32gb ram,0
"I purchased this computer last July. Says it has backlit keyboard, however, I just discovered that it does NOT have backlit keyboard!! Make sure the computer has everything you ordered when you receive it. Last night was the first time I need the backlit keyboard and it wasn't there.",0
"Build quality is great, the screen is awesome and responsive.",0
"Great buy. Using it since day one for work. I am a medical interpreter and I work on camera and so far it responds great. The keyboard very comfortable, I also love how light and thin is the laptop. I couldn’t be happier.",0
Please don’t waste your money I’ve owned this laptop for a about a year and it’s been nothing but problems Lenovo has already sent someone to my house to fix this thing twice now it’s broken for a third time and they will no longer honor my warranty,0
I tried my sister's and loved it so purchased one and love it. gave it to my 21 year old son to use for college - he loves it !,0
"i7-8750H 2.21GHz, (CORE i7 8th Gen)GPU: GEFORCE GTX 1060RAM: 16 GBStorage: 1T HDD 7,200 RPM + 128 Gig SSDDisplay: 15.6” FHD Anti-glare IPS 300 nits brightness, 60 HzBattery: 3 Cell, 52 Watt Hour capacityOS: Windows 10 HomeWhile Lenovo describes it as an entry level gaming laptop, I find it to be ‘upscale’ compared to what typically characterizes an entry level machine, which often tends to be more bare bones and barely qualifying as a gaming laptop.It is more subtle, simple, clean, minimalistic and sleek in appearance than its predecessors. It is understated and at the same time classy. Function leads form with this unit though form is not a distant second. Overall, the build quality is relatively solid and rugged. It is very compact and at first glance it comes off as something smaller than what you expect for a 15.6” laptop due to the thin bezel design, which reduces the monitor’s border considerably. The aluminum top cover is a nice touch and the glowing Legion logo on it gives it a cool look.The ‘soft’ rubberized keyboard deck has a nice feel and look to it though it could be more susceptible to smudges and fingerprints. I’m also not sure how resistant it will be to scratching and I obviously don’t want to put that to the test.The keyboard’s key-touch is smooth, soft and quiet, perhaps too much so. It lacks the tactile and audible feedback I would prefer, but I can envision some liking it this way maybe. However, the key travel is good.The white backlit keyboard can be adjusted to 3 levels of illumination, and does a decent job.The i7 is super-fast and has no problem with running many multiple parallel apps swiftly. The display is respectably bright and displays consistent color regardless of viewing angle.The cooling system seems to be a very well and effective design. The support ‘feet’ on the base’s underside surface provides a healthy clearance for the two massive air intake vents and the two massive area exhaust vents on the rear makes for an impressive cooling air flow; the best I’ve seen, in fact. Fan noise at the highest speeds is much quieter than what I’ve observed with other laptops.Battery life is about 6-1/2 hours under normal (i.e. internet and standard office apps), non-gaming use. I didn’t do any gaming tests with it, but it is safe to assume that battery life would be appreciably lower for that loading scenario.Instead of at the top center edge of the screen as is customarily done, the webcam is located toward the bottom, hinged edge of the screen, slightly above the level of the keyboard. This makes for a less than desirable, from the chin up viewing angle rather than an eye level line of view. Your fingers appear in the line of sight if typing while video chatting.The two forward facing speakers on front edge of the deck are relatively large and produce good sound/volume. They are as optimally spaced as the laptop’s size will accommodate and allows for as good of a stereo experience as this spacing limitation will allow for.It comes with 3 USB3 ports. One is located on the left side along with a combo headphone/microphone jack. Another USB3 port is located on the right side and the third is on the rear along with a USB Type C port (sadly does not support Thunderbolt 3), mini display port, HDMI output, GB Ethernet port, power port and Kensington lock.I really like that it didn’t come loaded with bloatware other than the MacAfee trial, which can be easily uninstalled.It comes with 2 Lenovo utilities that are quite useful for system features management.All in all, on a scale of 1 to 10, I give this a 9. It is a respectably featured and well-executed design with an optimistic future, especially for something marketed as entry level. I expect it to serve me well for years to come.",0
When I first got the laptop I thought I had ordered a 16GB RAM machine but it only had 8 GB installed. I went back on the Amazon site and checked. I apparently need to read a little slower when ordering. The laptop works fine and I REALLY like the backlit keyboard.I did have a moment of panic when I turned the laptop on and had NO backlit keyboard!! .....Was just getting ready to put it back in box and send it back when I noticed one of the Fn keys had a screen icon associated with it. What the hell.. so I pressed it and SHAZAMM.... I had a backlit keyboard.Now I am a happy camper and enjoying my HP laptop very much... 95% of my computer equipment in my office is HP and they have worked great.Jim DouglassFinney County Kansas,0

"Well, it does what I need it to. Bought this to be able to login and check resources on a game thats close to 20 years old. It can do it so I'm pretty happy with that. Though a smarttoaster shouldn't have trouble running SWG in this day in age. Not sure I will ever stress test this machine, just so happens I am not a fan of laptop computers. But it meets, and probably exceeds my needs in mobile gaming. Might even do some pvp on it someday if I find I am out of town and away from my PC.",0

"I am pretty blown away by his laptop. I had been using a Dell Inspiron 5755 (12 GB RAM) for years as my work computer, and this is a huge step up. I wish the screen was larger (15.1), but other than that. It is amazing. With 16 GB RAM it exceeds anything I need, and I imagine this would be a dream for a gamer, especially a teen, who would appreciate the lights on the keyboard more than I do. Easy set up. It is, also, surprisingly quiet. It is a bit pricey, but the performance is top notch so far.",0

"I like this chromebook, it's easy to hook up and because it only runs on chrome doesn't get too complicated. I am 72 yrs old and not really good with technology so it is a bit of learning curve for me. I would certainly recommend it.Edit: I am dissapointed that I can't do video calls on it. The camera only points to me and not the subject. Didn't realize this until recently.",0
"I brought this laptop in April in US and travelled back to India. Below is my experience and this is VERY IMPORTANT for anyone buying this in US and travelling to a country where this model isn't sold:- Heating issue from start. It gets usually so hot that you have no other choice than to use an external keyboard- Loud fan noise- Sometime just wont open simple applications like outlook etc and you need to restartAfter 5 months around, the display just went off(black screen). HP India didn't do anything saying this model isn't sold in India(smaller screen model is sold here). So this laptop has now become a piece of junk. I really hate my decision of spending my money on HP instead of Dell getting deceived by the looks.It's a nightmarish product.",0
"This laptop is sleek, light and nifty. But has serious flaws.- The biggest one being that it simply refuses to wake up from sleep mode. I've tried various workarounds from the web but no success- The battery life is also not as long as advertised. Barely makes it to an hour fully charged- Its noisy. The fan runs constantly- Audio isn't great. And fan noise just makes it worseRegret buying this one. I would recommend you pay the extra bucks and go for the other much better brands out there.",0
Owned the previous version but spilled water on it. Replaced with this model. Touch screen very responsive. Easy operation!,0

"I'd be VERY cautious buying from this listing specifically. Check my photos for what I mean but this computer came to me, not only dead-on-arrival, but showed signs that this computer was not only use, but opened and modified.Here's why I think that:- All of the case screws were loose- One of the case screws was too long for the actual computer and won’t screw in all the way (as if someone lost the actual screw and used something else, every other screw fit correctly)- Not a single factory seal or plastic covering you'd expect from a new computer (plastic screen peels, foam, etc.)- Cables cable tangled and knotted- Pieces were missing- Computer blue screened out of the box, cannot boot.- The tape on the outside of the box is packing tape used unevenly.One of the big problems is that there is a red plastic piece that goes into the right side of the computer case. That missing piece is an encryption key that can be modified to lock down parts of the computer, like drives, folders, programs, or even the entire computer. What I've noticed from the pictures that many people are posting here is that ALL OF THEM ARE MISSING THIS PIECE. Whether they lost it them selves or aren’t getting it to begin with I can't prove. But I find it very hard to believe that every single person here lost it on their own terms.Good luck and God help you if you end up getting the computer I returned.",0
It’s a good quality,0
"I would recommend this laptop for any buyers just looking for a very basic laptop. It is very quick to boot up so no wait time to get started on things like paying bills, surfing the net or checking emails. This would be a great laptop for an older adult or student who just needs one for the essential things because it is a very easy-to-use system. Also love the fact that is has so many port types (hdmi, SD Card Slot, 2 USB, and even an ethernet port for those every now and then moments) - no special adapters needed :)!!!",0
"I got this for things like taxes and reading books and longer articles, things that are not the best or not doable on my phone. Since I’m retired, I don’t need much in a computer, and this Chromebook seemed to fit the bill: it did what I wanted and the price was good. However, I expected it to last a few years, not three months! Over the last month, since the return window closed, it has become more touchy, until now it never opens without first shutting down at least once. Right now, it’s sitting on my lap, and it refuses to boot up. I’m very disappointed.November 2020I will never buy a Samsung product again! We purchased a phone ($400+) and this computer during the past year. Both were glitchy, and the computer doesn’t work. I rarely need a computer. I really wanted this to work if only minimally. It didn’t.",0

I had a MacBook Pro 13 2015...that machine lasted a long time and I love it. It dropped and I needed a replacement fast. MacBook Air 2020 is not a disappointment. The battery life even if downloading is incredible. I had it downloading all night and I still have a charge. It was only a slow download because the internet speed sucks. The touch ID is a delight. I love the picture quality. So far I am so impressed. Hopefully it will last as much as the other lasted.,0

"Was okay... I could see using it for school. Just not what I needed, so returned. Ty Amazon for the fast refund.",0
"It is very stressful for me to get new tech, being a more ""experienced"" person. My last phone had me wanting to throw it into large vats of water or stomp it with both feet and I did return it 3 times before finally managing to semi-adjust to it and I now have a so-so relationship with that piece of frustrating technology. So, when my Mac Air started to circle the drain I dreaded getting a new lap top. When my son recommended Chromebook I was skeptical that it could be as simple as it sounded to set up and use. But I was totally amazed!!! I had the lap top open and I was logged in with gmail in 5 minutes.Anything that I have needed to do has been easy to google. The screen quality and sound are both better than I had with the Mac but it was pretty old. The simple set up, speed and use of docs and downloads has been easy and I didn't have to buy software extra like I did with Mac. I also found connecting to my HP printer was much easier than the process to connect on my Mac.For me to transition from a Mac to the Chromebook was very smooth. This screen is so much larger than my Mac and has taken some getting used to. At this price my husband has encouraged me to get a smaller one to carry when we go somewhere but I am adjusting to this larger size. I thought the large size would be a viewing plus and it is. It's heavier than the small Mac and that is the adjustment. I use it for basics and work- banking, contracts, etc and I am very pleased!!! I will add that I never liked iPhones but did like my Mac Air but like the Chromebook much better so far.",0

"This computer is an absolute steal. I spent another $100 to add a second hard drive, but for the price of this computer with an 12th gen i9 and a RTX 3060, I don’t mind one bit. I’m able to run all of music production software and vst’s without noticeable latency. And it still can run games like COD Warzone and Rainbow Siege without a sweat.",0
"This can run any game you throw at it. Now I will mention that the cooling could probably be better; this thing does tend to run a little hot. But I built a laptop table with fans in it for this thing to sit on, and it drastically helps the overheating issue, if you even want to call it that. That's me *trying* to find something to complain about, though. This machine was built to last, and the fact that it has empty slots to add more RAM and extra storage? Pffft, no brainer. Best ~$1,500 purchase I've ever made.",0
The power port location was a bit awkward since it was on the right side in the middle,0

"I've had this laptop for just under a year and I would absolutely not recommend it. I bought it for basic school tasks - reading textbooks, word & excel documents, video lectures, etc. Here are my complaints:- It will sometimes not turn back on after falling asleep, requiring a restart.- It will randomly get extremely hot and loud until it kills the battery - even when it is not in use!!!- Speed is not consistent. Sometimes webpages and documents load just fine, other times very slow. I'm always on my home WiFi, which is strong, so that should not be the issue.- Even when this machine is operating as it should, the battery life is terrible.To be fair, this computer is okay for basic tasks...when it actually works! I'm just hoping it can last me two more years of school without too much frustration. I bought this as an upgrade to my old Chromebook but find myself still using the Chromebook frequently when the laptop gives me trouble.",0

"I bought this laptop at the end of March of this year, without having used it much until recently. It required Windows updates as well as driver updates. A few days ago, when I went to boot it, all I received on the screen was a ""Republic of Gamers"" logo. I restarted it multiple times, and received the same thing every time. There is no way to access BIOS, and now I have a nice $1500 brick. I will be contacting ASUS tomorrow to get on with my warranty, and will update as the process goes along. To say that I am less than pleased with this product is an understatement.Update 7/29:The SSD failed and was replaced. I've had it for about a week and haven't had any issues so far as I can tell. The warranty process took a couple weeks and if it was my only computer I'd have been far more upset than what I am. I will continue to use it and give a better review after I've had it for some time.",0
"Picked this up as something light and easy to carry around for working on personal coding projects while riding the bus. With crouton I was able to setup an ubuntu linux environment and run Visual Studio Code without much trouble. Part of why it's so light and cheap is that it has a cheap LED screen, not a nice glass screen like Samsung's tablets and phones. Can't really find a viewing angle where all of it looks right at the same time. However, still 5 stars as you get what you pay for: a cheap, decently rugged, light weight notebook to kick around and tinker with.",0

"I love doing tech reviews and if you want more in-depth reviews check out my YouTube channel ""OndaWire"" where I give the pros and the cons on everything. Working from has become challenging and finding a good PC to get my work, video and photo editing, side task, reviews, watching movies, and some gaming done is a challenge. I found this Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-54-760S Gaming Laptop a little over a month ago and have been using it every day, and ALL I CAN SAY IS, WOW!!!Pros:1. If you want top-of-the-line specs, LOOK NO FURTHER! This gaming laptop is LOADED! This model has a 512GB SSD and has all the ports you need.2. It's running the latest 11th generation i7 11800H processor with 8 cores running at 2.3 GHz and this thing is fast! I love how it threads and isolates power priority over just simple usage. What I mean is, it sends power to what needs power and uses less power on what doesn't need that much power.3. It is also topped with a 15.6-inch screen running at 144Hz and for those of you who are wondering what this means, let's just say, you WILL NEVER WANT TO GO BACK TO 60Hz. The screen refresh rate is SO FAST and SMOOTH! On 60Hz you will at times notice a glitch when gaming and at 144Hz, you will never see that! It makes things move so smoothly. The picture is super crisp and the details with the graphics really stand out especially when playing games.4. I do some gaming, but I do a lot of video editing and graphic editing. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card that this Helios 300 comes with is awesome and gives me all the power I need to do my video editing and the little bit of gaming I do. It also has 6GB of dedicated GDDR6 VRAM, and this is awesome because it allows the video card to use its own power instead of having to pull from the main RAM. When gaming, the tracing, tensor cores, and multiprocessors allow support of DirectX 12 and this really enhances the gaming experience. A lot of this may sound like a lot, but when you turn this gaming PC on, you will be in awe!5. The keyboard is absolutely stunning. It is backlit and matches the same color on the back of the laptop. It also has number keys so you do have a full-fledged keyboard and do not have to add any extensions. The buttons are super smooth and not clunky, and they make almost zero noise when hitting them.6. You will not miss a beat when using Ethernet or the Wifi 6 capability that Acer Predator Helios 300 Laptop comes with. I testes the internet speeds multiple times and at numerous times of the day and night, and I had absolutely TOP SPEEDS. I have 1GB internet speeds where I live and I consistently got those speeds! If you haven't experienced the signal strength of wifi 6, it is game-changing, but make sure your router can produce wifi 6. If your router doesn't support wifi6, then this PC will top out whatever speeds your router can produce.7. The cooling system on this Helios 300 is TOP NOTCH! You will hear your fan(s) kick on when they need to but you will never have to worry about overheating and your laptop shutting off on you in the middle of working, editing, or gaming. It is super ventilated as well. It has vents on the back and the bottom. I added pictures to show as best as I could. I tried to add a video to show for this review, but it wouldn't let me add it since I added so many pictures. lol8. It comes with 16GB of DDR4 3200MHz memory and it also has another slot in case you want to add more (up to 16 more for a total of 32GB)9. The design of this laptop is elegantly stunning and built very well! You can tell when you pull this out of the box, that you have a MACHINE! There were definitely no shortcuts when they made this laptop!10. This is by far a laptop that and the price point makes it a GREAT DEAL and it comes with a carrying case.Cons:1. I know this is packed with a lot and it says that you will get 6 hours of battery life, but with intense gaming, video editing, or streaming with the volume up, I go close to 4 solid hours maybe just a bit more. I will admit that with the fan, Bluetooth, wifi, and other things running in the back, it's expected to drain the batter a little more but typically when I look at laptops, I would love if the description was more accurate. Since this is primarily a gaming laptop, I would love to see ""expected"" battery usage after being tested under tough/heavy usage. Maybe you will get 6 hours of battery life if you are doing schoolwork or just browsing.2. In the description on Amazon for this RTX 3060 it says that the processor is i7 running 4.6GHz per core, but it's not! On the box when you get it, and when you open the PC, it shows that the cores are only running at 2.3Ghz. When I tested it, they definitely ran at 2.3/2.4 GHz. So this was super misleading and I hope Acer fixes this in the description so customers don't think differently.3. This isn't that big of a con for me, but I wish I could somehow turn off the startup screen from making the loud start-up Predator sound. It's cool, but I can't figure out if I am to turn this off without wiping the PC?Overall, I absolutely love this Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-54-760S Gaming Laptop and would HIGHLY recommend it! Even with the few cons that I listed, I still give this a 5 ***** star rating! This laptop is going to be with me for a very long time!",0

This laptop is a good value for money. The laptop is very portable and performant. I was unable to get the fingerprint scanner to work on Linux though. This is not an issue if you're using Windows.,0

Randomly shut downs with no warning. In the past have had good luck with EliteBook's. This one is trash.,0
Wanted a reasonable laptop and settled upon this - I’m basically using it as an internet surfing device and taking notes,0

Terribly disappointed. This is the second Lenovo laptop that I ordered that advertised as having a backlight but didn't. I have projects that I need to work on but have been delayed due to erroneous information. This has caused me valuable time and frustration. I guess that's what I get for buying online rather going to a stote in person.,0

Nice laptop. I got the I9 32gb 1tb ssd with nividia 70. One thing I had assumed (dummy me) was that the key board had a number pad ... it didn't. I can get an external later. Must have been made early in the year ... was a lot of driver updates. The My Dell support assist won't load ... keeps telling me to try again later! I bought it for use with blender rendering and I think it's going to be perfect once I get an external number pad. Ordered on Sunday and got Tuesday afternoon. It was packaged good!,0
It’s an Apple. That really says it all.,0

"The Chromebook itself seems great but then after 13 months, after the warranty expired the mouse pad no longer was useable. Luckily I bought the Asurion plan so I was thankful I did. They received the Chromebook and told me it would be 10 days, which was fine. I then received a phone call from a Robert saying unfortunately they had to order the part it would be in on Sept. 20th, 2020. They would then next day it to us. Still fine. Well I then receive an email on August 28th saying they were sorry the Chromebook could not be fixed they will return our money. They didn't even have the part yet? So did they try to even fix it? We paid $227 a year ago. I think honestly they are keeping it to fix and resale for the crazy $400 and above price. Completely unacceptable. Will never but Asurion again or a Chromebook from Amazon. Yes, I called several times to get answers, I'm actually sitting on hold right now for the 10th time so far it's been 31 minutes! They are impossible to get a hold of. Just talk to a Cindy and apparently Hp is no longer making the replacement part! Not sure why they are still selling this product, if thats the case.",0
I love this computer and I have had it for less than a day it was super easy to set up. And has great quality I really recommend it if you want a cheap amazing quality Laptop,0
"Great chromebook, but the battery doesn't last longer.",0
it is significantly more durable than older models.,0
When I opened the lid to this laptop it got caught on a small piece of black plastic in between both hinges and got stuck while trying to lift open the lid. Even though it was a certified refurbished item sold by amazon I was expecting the laptop to still come without an issue as basic as this wrong with it.,0
Received a good QC product from Amazon.,0
"Bought for kids for Christmas, easy to use, great price and the kids love it",0
i used this to drive a digical sign,0
"I really like this. The only issue I have with it is that it is only 720P, but for a 14in screen that isn't a real big deal for me. I think it's clear. The battery life is great on it. It lasts for a good 8-10 hours on a full charge. It's a chromebook, you don't really need it to be very powerful. So for what I use it for it works great. I use it for surfing the net and streaming video's on SlingTV, amazon prime video, and curiosity stream. I would buy this again knowing what I know. The price is right. It's a great buy.",0
"This is the computer I had just recently received as a gift is the one I’m basing this review on right now. It’s the HP Pavilion 2018 version, I’ve had it for about 2 years. It has a fairly poor battery life, lasting maybe 5 hours on a single charge. If the computer were to die completely at 0%, it would take roughly 10 minutes (sometimes much longer) to boot up and function to what it was when it had battery life. The computer must be on the entire time or the rebooting process will restart. It has amazing antivirus software, along with a free lifetime antivirus warranty that comes with purchasing this computer, except the computer must be bought during a special sales event. It can’t run any games on steam without it overheating and often crashing, and the same thing would happen while it was running zoom. Although not nearly as often as steam.It has a light up keyboard which is nice to have in poor lighting. This computer was also on the more expensive side, being around $500 depending on where you buy it. I’ve had to return it twice just to receive what seemed like the exact same one I turned in. It would overheat and the screen would glitch where parts of it would freeze and the rest was black. For a home computer it’s not the best option but a fairly cheaper option when compared to the nicer, more expensive computers out there. It’s also very large so it doesn’t make for the best “at school” computer either. There hasn’t been a single person I’ve met that has this computer at school so it doesn’t have much popularity amongst the youth.Most students tend to have its competitor, Apple, simply because their products perform better. I have had this computer shut down on me mid finals week my senior year. During the covid pandemic it was hard to stay in the zoom meetings because this computer would get too hot or it would completely freeze resulting in me having to restart it. I was given this computer by my dad because his friend is one the larger managers at a Best Buy so it was significantly cheaper. If you desperately need a computer and find Apple products to be too expensive, then I do strongly recommend this computer to you but only if it’s refurbished. That way it’s much cheaper and the price will align with its quality.",0
She is really happy.,0
Very frustrated with this device. Wish I never bought it,0
Purchased for my son. He loves it. Now he can play all his games on it. Have had no problems so far.,0
Arrived with a broken E key. I have no words to describe my surprise of the condition it is in straight out of the box. With no impact damage on the box or laptop it's largely looking like this somehow was overlooked before being packaged for shipping. This is super disheartening. Like how could this have gotten through QA? As a holiday gift this is not acceptable condition to gift it with.,0
Perfect for what I need it for it.,0
Worked well out of the box. After about 2 weeks it went dead and would not charge or power on. Notified Amazon and a replacement was sent to me overnight. No issues since but haven't reached the 2 week point yet.,0
SSD is very fast and the Ryzen 5 3550H plus RX560x combo is very snappy and loves to run games.,0
Ok it got alot of hate on youtube. I run this on high to ultra graphics on games. Its also great for work.Apex legends high/ultra- 65-75 FPSRocket league Ultra hdr - 255fps never seen it drop below 200fpsrainbow six siege high/ultra 55 fps -65 FPSWith more ram I am sure it will boost better looks like to max it out on RAM is about 200$ board supports 32 GB 16x2 max hertz is 3200.For the price I support this product. Its not gonna blast out all new games but youre here for a bargain to play PC games and this is it.,0

"Toshiba Dynabook Satellite Pro C50-J is a high-quality and fast everyday use traditional laptop.CPU: Intel Core i7-1165G7 2.8GHz - 12th generation CPUs around BUT still on the expensive side and i7 11th generation processors still awesome and so fast.Storage: KIOXIA Toshiba Nvme 512 GB SSD - Not the best but not the worst either, This model SSD write and read speed is kinda on the slow side if we compare similar price tag SSDs BUT it is an SSD and it will be much much faster than an HDD.Memory: Samsung 1x16 GB 3200 Mhz Ram - Excellent! Samsung is one of the most trustable brands and they make high-quality memories 3200 Mhz is on the fast side. This is a single 1x16 GB Ram which means if your laptop starts to slow in the future, you can add 16 GB more RAM easily to your laptop and make it 32.Screen: 15.6 Inc 1920x1080 Max Screen Resolution NO Touch Screen and Screen quality is not bad for this price range. Only blacks kinda have a little light reflection from the inside of the screen but I am sure not many users will notice that. Also, for me, no touch screen is the best. Why the world do I need a touch screen laptop? I just do not get it BUT some people like it and even want a touch screen laptop. So this depends on what you like I guess.Case - Material: Hard Plastic but well made and feels goodGraphics Card: Intel Iris Xe - If you are not familiar with the graphic cards, this is an integrated low-profile graphic card and this hardware doesn't use a separate memory bank for graphics/video. Instead, the GPU uses system memory that is shared with the CPU. So that means do not expect to play the AAA games at 60 FPS at all and do not expect this laptop to give you a high-performance video editing experience at all. BUT that is not mean you can not play any game with this laptop. NO, you will not have any issue playing popular games that aren't as graphics-intensive and some old AAA games like GTA V or Assassin's Creed III: Liberation or Baldurs Gate 3 can playable very high FPS. Final Fantasy XIV, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Civilization VI at 1080p resolution and 30 FPS. Even Microsoft Flight Simulator is playable, though only at 720p resolution with low detail settings. Older, popular games like Rocket League, Counter-Strike, and League of Legends easily exceed 60 fps at 1080p resolution and medium or high detail settings. Long story short this graphic card is very acceptable for this price tag.I also put the laptop on multitasking test which is I opened 15 google chrome tabs with some of them playing videos, I opened 5 Word documents, 3 Excel documents, 2 PowerPoint files at the same time, and I move 128 files from the laptop (totally around 2 GB) to one of my SSD external hard drive and laptop handle all of them pretty good. No lag or any weird thing happens.Conclusion: For $899 Toshiba Dynabook Satellite Pro C50-J is worth your hard-earned money. Remember this is for today's date and which is June 14, 2022. In time this price tag must go down and new model laptops will rise. This is how this market goes. Again for today's market HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",0
Lo compré para la escuela y me gustó mucho es muy rápido y la pantalla se ve muy bien.,0
"Great little computer for basic use. However, within 3 weeks began having issues with both USB ports. I keep a cooling fan under this at all times, which began having difficulties connecting at either port. I also direct-connect internet via an adapter. This too has had issues. I've replaced the adapters 2 times thinking that was the issue, but still same problems. Both USB ports appear to have ""short-like"" issues. Sometimes they work, sometimes not. No rhyme nor reason. I do NOT recommend this computer due to these hardware issues. Unfortunate, because it otherwise perfect for my needs.",0

Color Quality is great and can change the tones of the screen with the MSI Center.,0
Everything works beautifully.My previous macbook lasted 14 years (it still works fine). i hope this one will exceed that.,0
"This laptop is to replace an older model. Simple setup, lightweight without feeling flimsy and pretty to look at. Its fast, has a long lasting battery and does what I need it to do.",0
"I purchased the i7 version of this laptop about a month ago. It is fast. and build solidly. However, no matter how great the specs are and how responsive it is, if you can't see the screen , it is useless. I called tech support for Lenovo a couple of times with no success. First tech tried to repair it with no success, and the second tech just said return it because that's the way the screens on these laptops are designed. It is so reflective that it is a serious strain to work for more than a few minutes in a lite room and it cannot be seen at all in sunlight.",0
plays videogames smoothly,0
The notebook is very powerful and stable. It worth more than the price.,0
I have gotten was the screen bleeding once screen is dark.,0
"I bought this Chromebook as I thought it would be a helpful tool for taking notes and doing work away from my desktop computer, but I was exceedingly wrong. The Chromebook is more hassle than help, being incredibly slow and even occasionally freezing up for ~5 seconds when I am using Microsoft word from the browser.It also does not help that the Chromebook loses most of its convenience and utility without internet, not being able to access Google Drive and having limited use from installed apps.The only thing it does well is in having a small size, but even then the keyboard seems stretched horizontally and squished vertically so it can feel slightly off to type. That does not include the fact that the keys have to be pressed all the way down in order to type a character, so that makes typing lines of text a hassle with various misspellings of words throughout.",0
I can move it and use it everywhere.,0
BIOS has a setting to disable the annoying ROG brand POST graphic sound.,0
"La verdad me gusto mucho, cumplió todas mis expectativas y esta muy lindo y de muy buena calidad",0
"Update: This Chromebook has only proved to become more difficult. It now runs slower than previously stated and doesn't load all pages that our school uses. Oir basic tablet does a better job with load time and usability. The tracker pad has become spotty as well. We are now purchasing a new laptop and this is our expensive paper weight.I've had Chromebooks for years from Dell and Acer. This is my first Samsung purchase and was made during the shortages. I normally love Samsung so I was happy to score this after weeks of looking. However, I won't be purchasing another in the future from this brand. It does the job but it's clunky and doesn't seem to process quickly. This was purchased for my child for school but they find it very frustrating as it runs slow in load time (and it's not our network as I did consider that). It's basic - even for a Chromebook. The price is fair and it is easy to use. Ready to go right out of the box. If you don't need to use it for complex platforms, this might work for you. Now that Chromebooks and laptops are back in stock, I am already considering a different purchase.",0
I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. Within the month the screen had shattered. We are very careful with our electronics and the screen cracked just from opening. This is not a durable laptop.,0
"Great machine for all my needs. Also, secure OS. Set up is take out of box and open cover. Easiest computer to start up ever.",0

"If you know how, immediately install Windows 10 upon receiving the machine.If not, get someone to do it for you.Get your drivers from ASUS support site and update them as necessary, not all drivers are necessary.This probably goes for any modern-day computing device, to be honest.***Also, delete C-Media Control Panel (Not C-Media Audio Drivers/Service).You've been warned.Top review mentions rollover/ghosting issues. You really won't notice them. W + A + Esc is not a keystroke that is typically used (How would I even position my fingers?).Aside from that, it's a fantastic machine. If you can get the 300Hz screen, get it.",0
"It must be on a constant charge. Not impressed with battery life but otherwise, quite pleased.",0
"Great for gaming. Use it all the time for the sims.., worth it",0

Almost weight equal or similar to laptop itself.2. Gets real hot. almost hot to touch3. Battery life span is ridiculous. Okay I was playing game, but at 100% to shut off, took less then an hour. 50 minutes or so. about 3 hours you can get with regular use.4. Screen looks all fussy and not so clear.I'm returning this. Battery life is just a joke.If you are planning to sit this laptop at one place and use it, go get it and don't forget to buy a laptop cooler as well.For travel purpose, definitely a big no.",0
Playing all games max settings and running smooth,0

the computer is great,0
"YOU WILL NEVER REGRET THIS PURCHASE IF YOU ARE A MAC PERSON. IT IS GOOD FOR PC PERSONS AS LONG AS THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT, AS IT IS DIFFERENT FROM A PC. SOME SOFTWARE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND.",0

"I bought this laptop because the one I had for school finally started to give out, so I thought I might as well go all-out and get a computer I could also use for gaming. Im brand new to PC gaming, so for anyone who is buying this as a way to ease yourself into it, but also needs it for practical purposes I hope this helps. It runs games at at a really high FPS and the screen quality is pretty good at 144hz. However, it is extremely loud and theres not really a way to fix that if you want to use it for work or school. I also received it with a broken frame amd had to return it.",0
"It's working okay so far. We can't seem to get rid of the password option. It asks for it every time it starts up, and we don't need that.",0

"The cursor software causes the standard (pointe) cursor, the one most commonly used along with the other cursors as well to be erratic about 80% to 90% of the time; it appears to be some type of beta test software.

It left me with the sense I was being scammed.",0

"I bought this computer thinking it was new. Nowhere did it say it was used or refurbished. However, when opening the packaging it had a notice saying it was a refurbished unit. Confused, I went back to look at the order. There is still nothing on this page that says it is refurbished. The only place that said it was used was on the order details. Now the site (two days after ordering it) is showing the same computer for $70 less than what I paid (I'm assuming this was the refurbished price). So I paid the new price and got a refurbished unit. I'm not against buying a refurbished unit, I'm upset that I paid a higher amount thinking I was getting a new computer. The vendor needs to clearly state on the page that it is a refurbished unit, and charge you the refurbished price. Not happy with this purchase.",0
It works great I love it only reason I put a 4 star is sometimes the a key doesn’t work and sometimes the screen won’t click,0
"The case is plastic and just feels ""cheap"" for 900",0
I have been in love with this beautiful computer since I got it... And the only real downsides are no cd port and has little memory on the hard drive... I got an external one and now it's been going fantastic!!! Because I have no problems with this... Although sometimes I wish it had a CD port so I could watch some of my old DVDs on it... But seriously if you want a good gaming laptop this one is great.,0
The track pad for this machine is too smooth for me and gives my aging hands problems. And using the arrow keys to scroll doesn't work the same as my Chromebooks. I don't see where the Retina screen is in any way superior to my Toshiba HD Chromebooks.,0
"A well executed little machine that arrived promptly and in excellent condition. For the price, I don’t mind being a generation behind",0
VERY hot while gaming! You'll need a lap pad for anything longer than 30 minutes,0
Great laptop! Love it. Arrived promptly and was packaged very well. Very pleased.,0
"Very nice Chromebook. It isn't the best thing since sliced bread, but nice. The battery life IS NOT what some have claimed if you are actually using it. I have mine on full bright light and set where it does not go to sleep and screen stays on. With these conditions, the battery life is half of what others have claimed and gives me 4 to 4.5 hours of use.It plays videos nicely, although the screen quality is not what I am accustomed to on my gaming laptop, not even close. But this is only a $250 laptop, so what do you expect. The sound is FANTASTIC for a laptop, the best I have ever seen for a laptop.As with any Chromebook, open tabs eat up the ram. After having approximately eight tabs open, it froze up and shut down. So watch open tabs. I'm not very tech savvy and wonder why they don't make Chromebooks with more than 2.0 to 4.0 gigs of ram. I suppose there is a reason although ram is cheap but I certainly don't know why.I have several laptops and wanted just a basic Chromebook exclusive for a few online classes I need to take, so I ordered this Chromebook. My wife has this same version of Chromebook and after a year and a half, hers still works fine. So it is durable.In a nutshell, this is a very nice Chromebook and worth $258.00.",0
"I'm a heavy user and completely in the cloud and this is my only computer. I use it for business. I have it linked to my Android Note 8 (through a third party Chrome app) and it's seamless. It will run apps from the Google Play store. I usually have many multiple tabs open, expect it to operate like a full blown PC laptop and it generally does exactly what I want it to do. I watch videos, do photo editing, type thousands of words a day on it, stream movies and create Google Docs, Slides and Sheets. I bought this to replace my three year old version of the same Chromebook because all of the letters were worn off the keyboard and some of the keys weren't working ... I'm actively using my Chromebook probably 8 or more hours a day so it would probably last even longer for most people. It's lightweight and fits easily in a tote or backpack. It holds up well. I use it sort of all day and night and I haven't found anything it won't do. The only place I notice this being slow is ironically when I open up Google Inbox and then I get to practice patience for a minute. Occasionally it will get sort of slow and then I'll go to settings and clear the image cache and that takes care of it. I handle a lot of images so the memory fills up a bit after a while. It comes with 100 gigs of free storage for two years from Google and I'm sold on Chromebook. I usually run it off home wi-fi but I can also tether it to my phone or use public wi-fi. The bluetooth connects easily to everything. The keyboard is nice. I type 100 wpm and I like the keyboard and touch pad a lot. The keys are responsive and quiet. It's a nice, clean, simple design and easy to keep clean. The only thing I wish Samsung would do is make a little indent where the power cord goes in to help guide the plug in because you kind of have to look when you're plugging it in. The power cord is super compact and is just the plug and cord with no big clunky thing on it. I've been able to find cloud based solutions for every piece of software I was using previously and I don't miss the PC at all since I went into the cloud in 2015. I really don't miss having to constantly update my system and all of the software. Google updates are super fast. You basically just restart and you're ready to go. It boots in seconds although I usually just leave it on constantly. I set my browser downloads to save to my Google Drive so there's no personal information stored on the Chromebook at all. It's under $200 and it's better than my $1200 PC laptop I replaced when I switched to Chromebook three years ago. It's absolutely silent. No fans grinding away. I sit with it in my lap all day long and it never gets hot. I don't play video games but I imagine that it would play cloud-based games fine. I've inadvertently had more than a dozen YouTube videos playing at the same time and it was sort of noisy but it wasn't lagging. And when you want to replace it, you just backup anything you've stored on the small hard drive and run the power wash on it. The only program I couldn't find a cloud solution for was Scrivener. But now you can get a virtual hard drive in the cloud for a fairly reasonable monthly rate and run any software you want on the Chromebook. It holds up to constant use and it's really sturdy despite being really slim and lightweight. The screen hinge is super strong and it's hard to imagine it breaking unless you dropped it.",0
"Una muy buena decision comprar este equipo. El rendimiento es súper bueno y la pantalla también, que son las razones por la que lo compré. Las luces también se le dan un buen toque y el dise?o en general tiene buen estilo. Es mucho más liviana de lo que esperaba, así que mejor.Puntos negativos, la batería dura a lo max 2 horas (entendible), los botones del mouse pad no me terminaron de convencer por el material y por el sonido que hace cuando le doy click.",0
"I first bought an Acer Chromebook without really knowing what to expect or much in terms of research, and lucked out. I got a solidly dependable product I used for 4 years without any hiccups. However, I could tell the Chromebook was starting to approach its expiration - it was having a hard time loading multiple tabs or object-heavy pages and its RAM was probably too low for the rapidly proliferating content on the net. So I chose this Samsung Chromebook with faster CPU speed and twice as much RAM, thinking I would get the same kind of dependable performance, but better! Surprisingly, it was the OPPOSITE. First, the volume was markedly low - I played the two Chromebooks side by side, and I couldn't stream a movie on the Samsung Chromebook without adding a third-party browser plugin to amplify the sound. Fine, whatever. Annoying, but I can live with that. But then the Samsung Chromebook started shutting down the display instantly for no reason, so that I would have to wake it up. The screen also went black when the Chromebook was lightly moved, though it woke up when I used the touch pad. This made me wary, but I'd spent a TON of time doing product comparisons to finally settle on this Samsung, and I just didn't want to undo all that effort and send it back. But then the straw that broke the camel's back. It is constantly freezing or stuttering when streaming movies! For comparison, I tried alternating between the older Chromebook and the Samsung to make sure it wasn't my Wifi being throttled by good old Verizon. Nope! Definitely the Samsung, consistently freezes and stutters on video playback and this is REGARDLESS of time of day. Instead of better performance, I got worse, in every way. Disappointed because I thought Samsung was such a reliable brand, and I didn't even know what an Acer was back when I first bought the older model! I will have to hold out and buy a different brand of Chromebook, maybe go back to Acer.",0
The keyboard has a nice feel and the lighted keys can be nice for working in dimly lit spaces.,0
I thought I had bought the right la too. But the battery dies really fast. Don’t recommend it.,0
The keyboard has good feeling with decent travel distance while typing.,0
Lousy product. Takes forever to upload. At this moment unable to reach the internet. Don't know why,0
"Bought for my husband after his other asus only lasted 18mths. I was skeptical to say the least, but this was what he wanted. Aside from the volume being horrible, it appears to be working just fine. We’re only 2mths into it so I’m still very cautious.",0
"Neat and shiny, great gift.",0
Tengo un mes con el equipo y hasta el momento todo excelente sobre todo tomando en cuenta el precio,0
"It just didnt come with original packaging. But it looks totally new to me. Even the Windows 10 key worked perfectly. It is a dual core i5 processor with 8 GB RAM and 500 GB HDD. The screen resolution is 1600 X 900. Also a touch screen. Plenty of USB ports, display port and a VGA port. It went through several Windows 10 updates once connected to internet which took several hours. Once everything updated, the machine ran awesome.",0

Big letters on the keyboard plus the back light. Large screen is wonderful.,0
"When it arrived, the seal of the outer packaging had been torn. Obviously it was opened. I think it should be an open box. But obviously when I bought it, there was no prompt that it was opened. Otherwise I would not buy it. The speed of the computer is very fast, and the style is also beautiful.",0
"I've only had my computer for a couple of days. I just finished registering it on the ASUS page and got a notice that the 5 yr warranty is expired. This should not be since I just purchased it BRAND NEW. I don't usually give a review until I've used a product for a few months, but I had to warn others of this issue.",0
La pantalla super bienY la batería para la potencia de la laptop aguanta bien aparte que la laptop mismo cuida de la misma al optimizar la carga,0
I have not added any programs or anything and when I tried to put Adobe on and it continues to crash everytime I try to open one document. I also received a message saying low on memory and thay was before I added anything to the laptop. I'm not sure I am happy with it at all.,0
"Although the colors on this product are not vivid, that is a minor problem compared to the sound. I have checked all settings for increasing sound and have them on max; however, even with earbuds, the sound is quite low. I have looked into getting help from Asus in case I am missing something, but they want you to sign up for a program that they charge for. What???? No thanks.",0
"While the Lenovo Legion 5 is probably the best laptop all around for the price, horrible support negates any positives.Pros:->Configured with the AMD 4800H processor which has desktop class speed in a laptop->IPS matte screen with great color->Excellent keyboard which is great for speedy typing and gaming->Great speakersCons:->Poor battery life - wish they could add an option with a beefier battery->Terrible supportMy screen and motherboard were faulty with my unit. I called support on 12/06 and requested on-site repair. On-site repair emailed me on 12/08 with instructions to be ready for a tech to show up on 12/09. This sounds amazing! Only three days...? Well, when things are too good to be true, the next part of the story is a given!12/09 - No show - I was told:""Due to an unexpected higher than usual call volume in your area, we are having difficulty scheduling a technician to provide service on 12/09/2020.A technician is planning to provide service on 12/10/2020.""12/10 - No show - I called the contractor and they told me to call if no one shows up by 11AM on 12/11.12/11 - No show12/14 - I finally get a call from a service agent although I can barely understand what he is saying. He asked me if I had the parts and that someone signed for them. I tell him no. He never shows up. I get the following email:Our records indicate you have rescheduled your appointment for 12/16/2020 between 15:00 and 17:00.^this is not ture^I called Lenovo and they said the parts weren't shipped out yet. I was provided the tracking number.12/16 - No show - I get an email that service will show up on 12/17 between 8AM and 12PM.12/17 - No show - I receive an email stating that they were too busy.12/22 - Finally a technician shows up but late in the afternoon. After 6 hours, yes 6 hours - he only replaced the LCD and not the motherboard he was provided. I had no use of the kitchen all night due to COVID-19 concerns, and he was in the home until 10:39PM. I wake up for work at 5AM.Since he didn't have time to replace the motherboard (which he should have done when he took the whole thing apart the first time), he lied and claimed the anti-static bag was damaged. Furthermore, he did not properly replace the LCD or mount the heatsink/fan assembly. The CPU runs at 91C and is stuck at 381MHz.He then requested all new parts from Lenovo again including a new heatsink/fan assembly. And he told me multiple times that if I find a screw, it's not from the laptop but something else. Why would I have screws in the kitchen? Lenovo has a policy that the contractors do not lose screws...I called Lenovo 12/29 and told them the problems I had. I was told that they would escalate my case and provide me with a response within 3 days.It's now 01/05 and I haven't heard a word from Lenovo.Bottom line, if your computer breaks, Lenovo might never honor their warranty. I now sit with a brand new paperweight. I will update this review with how Lenovo responds.*UPDATE*Called Lenovo on 01/07 after waiting much longer than the three days I was told to wait for a response. The tech support told me that an escalation request was not placed until 1/06! When I asked why it wasn't done the day of, she told me that it was due to the virus. The virus has been around all year, so I don't believe this response.She told me I can return the laptop to Amazon which I've done. I am currently awaiting my refund because Amazon said it was unable to send me a replacement.",0
The customizable joystick space bar on this device allows users to tailor their movements and actions to their liking.,1
three zone RGB is awesome.,0
"ok the device is good, thermals are nice,it's good value for money in this terrible markets...i experienced some crashes....can't figure out it's source YET....though works nice....the control center is terrible worse than alienware one x(the TB4 port doesn't send a display out signal idfk why! support is bad via email or website....ask me if you want to figure out something!",0
Lo estuve testeando por qué no era para mí a mí gusto la pantalla deja que desear pero el procesador muy bien probé algúnos juegos regulares y no pesta?eo la compré por el procesador y precio que tenía la verdad es que casi no juego pero si soporta estos juegos sin problemas podrás trabajar muy bien con ella,0

love this nice beautiful replacement for my Samsung XE303C12 that i had since 2014. what did i dislike ? that i waited so long . it is like new. i hope any person that buys one is as happy as me. was not paid a cent for this review.,0
Great little computer. Works awesome for what I need it for. Charges well. Battery lasts for quite awhile. Super simple and easy to set up.,0
"I love everything about this laptop except for the track pad. It's a great size, weight, works very well but the track pad is absolutely terrible. It works well 80% of the time but the other 20% it completely freaks out and is essentially unusable. If you get this laptop you'll need a mouse for that 20% because you can't do anything when it randomly decides not to work.",0
So disappointed.,0
Good bang for the money,0
Quite good for this NB. This is exactly what I wants.,0
I needed an RTX card for Ray Tracing architectural images during field work. This is a very basic machine and I am not a gamer. I am very pleased. I would buy it again.,0
"I bought this machine two years ago. This machine has no performance issues, but the hinge for the laptop screen keeps on breaking. It broke 2nd time for me now and I only use this laptop for document typing and coding purposes in my office.",0
"Love this little Laptop. I only really use it for streaming and watching YouTube TV. Pretty good resolution decent speed, keyboard layout not bad. all in all great buy for me.",0
"I purchased this item and the backlit key didn’t work. Called HP for troubleshooting and it still didn’t work. I am a tech expert so I was aware of troubleshooting steps they walked me thru but is still didn’t work. I received a replacement from Amazon and the backlit key still does not work. My friend and I googled it and those options for the function still didn't work. Viewed the exact model on google and followed steps and still didn't work. I googled q&a and it said it had the backlit keys but that is incorrect. After troubleshooting myself, following instructions from the instructions within the package, verifying the correct model with the instructions, speaking to HP tech that said he had the same model just a few years older...all this and I then google some tech q&a on this product and it Does Not have the feature. I needed this PC for work and now I am beating against time to have one shipped to me. Only after I received a replacement did I discover the misinformation about the features for this PC. 😡",0
"I had been looking into upgrading my skylake i5 w/ 1080 desktop, and yikes the prices are outrageous right now. Thanks ""shortages!""Took a peek at laptops, and after some research I came across this one on newegg. Kept researching it, the performance, and nothing comes close in price. Hardware wise, this will outperform most of the higher priced competitors with similar specs (as the GPU can boost to 130w). Purchased this as my long term desktop replacement, for light gaming, light video editing, and daily use. It compiles videos close to 4x the speed it took my desktop.So far it has worked flawless for me. I play on a 2k gaming monitor connected to mini dport with gsync, or connect to my 4k TV. I get 30-40fps on cyberpunk maxed ultra settings at 4k, but turn on vsync and limit to 30fps to stop tearing on tv.The only major annoyance for me so far is that after rebooting, settings don't hold for the rgb keyboard, at least until within windows. The flashing bright rgb colors annoy me, and I dont want to advertise that I may have a fancy laptop if i take it out somewhere. Heck, I even removed the intel/rtx stickers lol.Battery life isnt great, but you can squeeze in a couple to few hours in low power mode browsing the internet.For some reason Edge screws up the display driver until rebooted, and the screen begins flickering with other issues. Replaced Edge with Chrome, and I havent had any display issues since. A google search shows this is common, and is blamed on the graphics driver (lol microsoft...)The day i received it, windows 11 was released, so i immediately created a restore image from windows, and upgraded. Aside from the edge issue, everything has been flawless.Installed a 2TB samsung 970 evo plus in the second slot a couple weeks after receiving the unit.Knowledge level: I'm a desktop tech with 8 years enterprise experience, a programmer, and used to do a lot more gaming than I do now.",0
The dedicated GPU is very basic but can handle most things you throw at it,0
Reason for the 3 stars. I’ll tell you. I bought this for a friend who needed a computer to set up a ovh. (Vpn). Unit worked great for the first few hours!! One issue. Would not charge. Ordered a new charger hoping it was the charging unit. No luck. Now I’m going on week 2 waiting for my return credit. :/. $400 stilling in limbo Amazon! (Hahahaaa),0
"Wouldn't you know, this Asus Vivobook 203 laptop worked fine for just over a year, and then bricked itself without any warning or ANY changes whatsoever to the system. Turns out you can't boot from a USB drive with eMMC, so now this thing is completely useless. Warranty for this model is only 12 months. Waste of my money and I probably will never buy another Asus product.",0
"Sharp picture, nice keyboard, easy to use once you understand how it works. ie: It has no operating system (windows) or desk top features. It runs everything through Google search.",0

"I needed a small chromebook for business travel, and this one met my needs. Well built, bright screen, and responsive touch pad. Using gmail and google drive in offline mode worked great. The chromebook played MP4, MKV, youtube and amazon prime videos smoothly. The bottom mounted speakers were loud enough for personal viewing, but I use headphones most of the time.If I needed to ever replace it, I would buy the unit again.",0
"Charger died 1 day after return/exchange window; cameras are garbage. Even 128 GB version from Best Buy has these problems. Short of warranty, hinge broke and screen shattered just opening it. Samsung would not honor warranty. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Do not by this trash.",0

You can adjust it, I've just been too lazy to do so lol.Very nice computer, starts up super fast???What surprised me was it has a FULL sized keyboard. Alexia is a very nice touch. The speakers are surprisingly good. The design is very nice as well. Search youtube and see reviews on it. Thats what I did before I purchased. All good reviews.",0
This laptop it’s good.It can hold a lot of games with graphic .But it’s battery it’s the shortcoming. _(:τ」∠)_ you can play for no more than 3 hours in power saving mode.But watching or studying it’s fine.Anyway I like this laptop.(??????)??,0
"I use this computer for simple day to day tasks. It crashes daily. I bought is mid-July and two keys have already fallen off. I am retired, and don't abuse my machine, but this is the worst laptop I have ever had. The support web page is difficult to navigate, and it is not helpful. They post an article on fixes with no links, and when you try to find it, the search results in a link to an add. So sorry I bought this",0
"My granddaughter had no clue we were giving her a chromebook for Christmas this year! WOW, what a hit! She was so surprised and couldn't believe she actually was gifted a Chromebook! Thanks for making us the best grandparents in the whole city!!!",0
Good value for price,0
"The computer has excellent hardware. Battery life is one of the downsides as it is surprisingly short. You can't relly on this computer if you plan to use it away from a power source for longer times (3+ hours).The other disappointment for me is the lack of GNU/Linux support. ASUS is considerably behind other companies on that matter. If you live exclusively on GNU/Linux world I would suggest looking into somewhere else (System76 or Purism perhaps). If you must dual boot with Windows, look for Dell or Lenovo.This computer works with Linux. The problem is that some features, such as keyboard shortcuts to control screen brightness and keyboard backlight doesn't work. Actually, the volume control is the only shortcut that works.I've bought this computer because of a deal offer with a very good price. Otherwise, I would probably buy a Dell, for the Linux support.",0
Very useful computer,0
"Bloatware sky-high! I counted 15 unnecessary ASUS apps (not including Windows bloatware, and not including ASUS Crate which is valuable).",0
The screen is really bright and you can see more definition than either Ace,0
"I was going back and forth with purchasing a laptop. I was only needing something for internet and basic use. I thought it was going to be too small so I didn't get my hopes up. I've had it less than a week and I love it! Yes, the screen is small, but I was pleasantly surprised that the keyboard is pretty regular size. I'm still figuring how to use it, but I love the simplicity. I give it 5 stars for a simple, everyday laptop!",0
"What a great improvement over my old MacBook Pro. This is my third such computer. It keeps me in touch with the world and Amazon. What bugs me is the razzle dazzle passwords I must come up with to access other sites which is why I use Amazon almost exclusively There are so many goodies on this one that I will probably use only a few, though it is made for the new generation of users. Great product. Thanks Applel",0
"After having the notebook for 6 months, i was seeing very high temps, in normal use, so i open the notebook avoiding warranty for sure but the thermal paste that they use is horrible, my laptop was running max fan speed at 105 the cpu, after putting thermal grizzly the temps went down to 92, and a lower fan speeds, dont recommend this laptop for normal use people, and if you buy it recommend to change thermalpaste",0
"Not gonna get technical, there are enough videos rating this laptop for that. Camara is meeh, average really, sound is really well, haven't gotten any BSOD yet so that's great, also love that I can turn on/off the camera. For the price is a really great offer and laptop. 100% recommended.",0
Nice chrome book!,0
5 stars for its price value (579$ when i bought it)It's fully plastic you can feel it as a cheap material but that's what you get at this mid range gaming laptops.The performance is amazing and that's the main advantage you would buy this laptop for.Sound is poor(no bass) to some extent but acceptable at this price range.Screen quality is excellent for what you pay for.Don't look for a good battery in gaming machine.There are 2 slots for nvme SSD and 1 for 2.5 sata hdd or ssd and an additional empty slot for RAM so this device is upgradable to great extent.,0

this slow ass computer I couldn't turn the mf on my takes all day to load and I got to download a music software and the mf labtop said no storage like wtf I got it today,0
"I've had this computer for about two weeks and I am very pleased with it.A lot of the reviews I read said the fan was really noisy and distracting. I have only heard it be ""noisy"" a few times when I was running several softwares and even then you definitely wouldn't be able to hear it across the room.The touchpad has two-finger scrolling!!! My old laptop didn't have this feature and the touchpad was almost unusable but this touchpad is reactive and quickly and smoothly responds to any input. The touchpad settings are also very customizable.I was unsure whether I'd like or use the fingerprint reader but I have it enabled and it recognizes me maybe 80% of the time, it has definitely seemed to improve since I first turned on the feature.The keys glide smoothly and are very ergonomic in their placement. One of my requirements was a built-in num pad because I use it for school and finances daily and again, I really like the layout. My old laptop also had a num pad but it seemed to turn on randomly and was difficult to turn it back on (it wasn't just a simply num lock issue). I have yet to experience any issues with keeping num lock turned on.It does come with a stylus. I have only used it once when I set up the laptop just to play with it. Seems pretty cool, I can see how some people might like it for taking notes or drawing. The pen itself is weighty like a fountain pen and seems very responsive.A few complaints:The other reviews are correct, the processor speed is not advertised correctly. When I open up my specs it reads 1.8GHz not 4.9GHz or whatever it claims to be. It hasn't really become an issue yet though. For running Matlab, Excel, Chrome, and Solidworks simultaneously it does not seem to slow the system down to an annoying point.Additionally, there is only one USB and one USB-c port. I usually have my wired mouse and printer plugged in which both use USB. I bought a multiport adapter that plugs into the USB-c port for my printer which is a bit more unwieldy but it's manageable since I usually use my laptop at a desk.All in all, a great laptop so far. I'm loving the touchpad, num pad, and unit weight!",0
Amazon had the best price at the time. Great machine. The keyboard is sublime. There are plenty of online reviews on websites and YouTube. This machine truly hits the sweet spot.,0
Awesome machine. RTX graphics card handles the best games like a stud. Newest i7 chip is fast. Stays cool while gaming. Super sturdy construction. Great screen response time. Just all around great laptop. I have had the GP73 for couple years love it so much bought the GP65 for my son. Amazing laptop for a great price.I have been seriously happy with MSI laptops. Only thing I would change is I bought a 1tb m.2 NVMe ssd for it to beef up the storage space.,0
"Will update as I learn more about the computerUPDATE 1: I have had this computer now for only two days, overall it's been a fairly nice two days. Didn't go as smoothly as I was starting it up for the first time. When I was setting my new password for some reason the ""5"" key on the numpad was not working, however it is miraculously working now. Also after noticing there was an update, I updated the laptop and when it was booting back up, after the log on screen it was just a black screen that wouldn't go away. I shut it off two times with no progress. However, after shutting off the laptop for the third time I decided to remove the Mouse usb, when I turned it back on it went back to normal and started as if nothing happened. It hasn't happened again. So that was a bit of a setback. Besides that, I've been having a smooth experience with the laptop. It's pretty fast. I will test the gaming aspect some time soon.UPDATE 2: I've had the laptop for a few months now, it's working very smoothly, it's fast when starting up, and I've had no major issues. I haven't tried playing any newer 'heavy' games but the witcher 2, LA NOIRE, murdered soul suspect, maple story, and skyrim run extremely well on it. I also use a drawing tablet on the laptop and I haven't had any issues with that either. It runs good. I just started the new college semester so I'm going to be using the laptop more frequently and I'll be using programs like Visual Studio and Autopsy so I'll update again soon!",0
The dell suffers of materials issue leading to slow down several times a day and reboot is necessary. nothing helps not even factory reset.,0
I bought this for my 8 year old and it’s perfect for him. I own a photography business and wouldn’t recommend this for photo editing at all but it is a great starter computer/child’s computer!,0
Computer has disconnected from the internet twice and says there is no connections available. The only way I have found to remedy this is to factory reset the laptop and start over.,0
"No camera from the start but problems have increased since thenTouch pad works off and on and now as laptop warms up, laptop freezes up and there is no response. Have called service and put on hold. What good is customer service and Warranty service if product fails just out of the box. If this is AMD products I will go back3/28/21 - update after several updates and several phone calls to Amazon who have been more than helpful.. the computer is working ok with the exception of the camera that works but is so blurry it cant be used.. will keep you updated",0

"I had one before and loved it, passed it along to my grand-kids for a newer model and got this one. The battery life is about 12 hours. It is very light weight. It is an excellent Chrome book with a very nice screen to watch movies and speakers to listen to music. I love it.",0
"This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought for a computer. NO RIGHT CLICK button, makes you have to use hybrid screen touch and keypad with inconsistent pattern. No ethernet port and insufficient usb ports given it has No DVD either. Do Not Waste your money on this, there are way better laptops cheaper.",0
"Ok,I will start from the part were the Chromebook that I bought IS NOT NEW and on the details said is NEW. I feel very pistoff and bad cuz I was fuelled. I buy a lot from amazon and is the first time that happened to me.Is looking good ,no scratches nothing. We connected at tv (hdmi) and is working perfectly.When we open it we've been asked about a password, somebody else was connected and from there we realize that is not new. The serial number on the manual guide is not the same with the one on the back of the chromebook.Came with the original power cord.We reboot it and is ok.",0
"The only reason I'm not giving this laptop a 5-star rating is due to its trackpad. Though, if we're being honest with ourselves all trackpads that aren't on a MacBook are just OK. The trackpad gets 'stuck' every now and then and you'd need to swipe back and forth for it to stop skipping. One thing you could do is adjust the sensitivity in Windows' trackpad settings and that does help it be less...sucky.Look, aside from that, it's a perfect machine. The keys are nice and responsive to type on. I haven't had ANY issues with it crashing on me. After a particular Windows update, it would not shut down after I closed the lid and I'd end up commuting back home without realizing it was still on and the machine would be ridiculously hot but that's stopped happening after a recent update.I dual boot Ubuntu on here so if you're a developer who hasn't drunk the Apple kool-aid then I think you'll be pretty satisfied with this machine. I obviously replaced the hard drive with an after-market SSD (I think I went with Corsair this time...or was it Crucial?I'm a software engineer so I often need to run a lot of applications at the same time as well as background services like nginx, php, mysql, mssql, mongo...you get the picture - no issues whatsoever with its performance.I'm not sure what the issues were with those who gave 1-star ratings. Perhaps it was just bad luck. After all, equipment manufactured at scale is never 100% for every instance of the product that is assembled.I think you'll all be very pleased with this machine.",0
"I purchased this as used and certified but at a large discount. As you can imagine I was nervous. This has run for months now flawlessly. It is small, light, powerful, and handsome. I have had no mechanical issues and no problems whatsoever. A fantastic laptop that eats up games and the occasional cross lookup pivot table.",0
"This computer sends me a message that there is an upgrade. Then its asks if I want to upgrade, it may not compatible with my system. Don't the company know whether the upgrade is for my computer? Not feeling this laptop at all. It has shut down for no reason other than a recent update and will not turn back on. I'm done!",0
"the keys seem completely flat, so I found it hard to center my fingers, and often hit two adjacent key simultaneously",0
"I received my laptop today and I’m really enjoying it while learning it, the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the speakers are rather disappointing and not as good as the ones on my iPad Pro. I placed the laptop and iPad side by side and the iPad is louder and clearer. Set up took about 10 minutes, getting all of your apps is rather difficult, much easier on mobile devices. The screen is bright and big, watching YouTube, Hulu, espn and Netflix were great once installed. My social media pages operated well, and most importantly the speed in operations is fast as my iPad. Had trouble linking my phone to this laptop but I’ll keep trying, next I’ll test how easy the printer set up is and come back and update my review. But I would recommend this product you just may need some external speakers to get total satisfaction out this unit. Update; connecting to printer was a breeze. Battery life was 6 1/2 hours of continuous play Binge watching Netflix.",0
The laptop came malfunctioning. When I started the laptop a message appeared informing that the system as detected that a cooling fan is not operating correctly.,0
"Would not turn on. Turned on, then shut off. Then would no longer charge. It was a waste of time and money. Returning.",0
"This is my first macbook and thank you for changing the shipping restrictions, I was able to buy one. I am still adjusting with the keyboard and the OS coming from a long time windows user. The battery life is amazing. Better than my windows laptop. Hopefully I can buy the higher specs next time, I don't mind paying the tax. I originally wanted to get the 16gb ram and 1tb storage, but it doesn't ship to my location. And thanks for the fast shipping.",0
"It works. Haven’t done too much with it yet but, it works pretty well for the adobe products.",0
"Everything is perfect. Couldn’t be happier. Powers up immediately , great battery life, great keyboard , amazing features. Was considering an Apple product but I’m much happier with this! Google is amazing.",0
Did not like this tablet or computer at all. I use a dell and this one had too many quirky key locations. Had to return it. Also found it to be very slow compared to others.,0
Very good laptop for begginer-mid gamer,0
"Yo soy estudiante en linea y puedo decir que es un gran articulo, llevo en perfecto estado y funciona de maravilla, la pila no se agota tan rápido como yo pensaba, No se traba, no se alenta, la verdad me gusta muchísimo y la super recomiendo.",0
So far so good. A lot of updates and over a fast connection approximately 3 hours of initial install. Backup recovery takes awhile too. Some bloat ware to remove. Easy to get fingerprints on keyboard area. Since HD is a hybrid really have to be careful about where to install/load data. The master OS will be full pretty quickly so remove old windows install files ASAP.Runs good but highly recommended adding the 8 ram from the start. Remember there is a screw under tape in middle when open back. Easy to remove and upgrade other than that.Will update once my songames on it. It’s a birthday gift. Set it up so he wouldn’t have too. I do know runs PUBG and overwatch well.,0
"WiFi stopped working after a week, likely due to a faulty WiFi card. There are many reviews on internet with the same problem.",0

"Very timely shipping, received in great shape and worked right out of the box with no issues to report.wife was thrilled with her new laptop. Definitely would buy another one if I needed to.",0
"This laptop had a black screen within 6 month of owning it. I had to ship it back to acer for repairs as they wouldn’t replace it ... that’s a 15-30 day process. I still haven’t gotten it back. ok update I got it back but unfortunately its now overheating and has to go back to acer once again , also they scratched it while repairing it",0
"Nice laptop, nice lines. Only the color I do not like, i would like a darker color, but as for what the computer is, I am very happy. I think it's quite fast, the graphics are very good, the sound a little weird because I was not used to Harman Kardon. The keys of the keyboard seem to me very spaced, they must go more together to favor the writing.",0
I liked everything except that the screen had issues and a couple of the keyboard buttons were sticky like someone used them. The screen kept flickering,0
"The Victus line of laptops from HP is supposed to be for budget-conscience gamers who want a laptop that has decently powerful internals but forego some of the unnecessary things like RGB lighting and an elaborately designed case. I think that it mostly delivers on that idea, but this is still an $1100 machine and other brands like Lenovo are capable of delivering the same specs with a good screen and a little RGB (at least on the keyboard).The first thing I did when I got this laptop was upgrade the Ram to 32GB, mostly just to see if it would cause any problems using third party, 3200Mhz DDR4. I was really annoyed to see that there is no easy way to expand the storage. This laptop has a single M.2 slot and no place to install a 2.5-inch SATA SSD. The only thing that can be upgraded at all, is upping the Ram to 32GB (it will support 3rd party sticks at the full speed of 3200MHz).The Ryzen 7 5800H is one of the most powerful 45 watt processors from AMD, it is still quite good but it has been replaced by the 6800H. The difference isn't huge, but it's worth mentioning that you are getting a 2021 CPU in a 2022 laptop. The 3050Ti is still current generation, as it will be a while before the laptop versions of Nvidia's 4000 series GPUs are released. It has a 75 watt TGP, which is close to the top end of how the 3050Ti can be configured. I have used another laptop that has an 85 watt version of the 3050Ti and the performance of the two laptops is very similar and I wouldn't be worried much about it being slightly less than the maximum TGP.I really love the keyboard on this Victus, it's backlit but the only color is white. I think some people might prefer this look because it's more conventional, and kind of just looks like a regular laptop. The trackpad is really smoot and accurate, it's pretty large as well (for a Windows laptop). It's slightly off-centered, but it's not as bad as some laptops.The port selection is good, I wish they would have given us at least one 3.2 gen 2 USB C port, but all the ports top out at 5 Gigabits per second, not a huge deal, but it seems like another unnecessary feature to leave out. Just like the lack of power delivery charging via the USB C port, it's only data and video output only, no PD charging of the laptop itself. If it was available, it wouldn't provide enough power to allow you to play games, but it could work if you were using the laptop for anything non-gaming related.The last thing that I have to mention is the screen, it is 1080p with a 144Hz refresh rate, but the colors are kind of dull and disappointing for a laptop that costs over $1,000. It only has a 45%NTSC color space, which is pretty far from 100% sRGB. It's not awful or anything like that, but it's another compromise you have to make if you buy this HP Victus. If they could have given us a good screen for this price, then I could have forgiven the rest of the shortcomings. I just don't understand why they didn't try a little harder to make this competitive with other gaming laptops around the $1,000-$1,200 price range. It's like 85% of what you would get from the competition, assuming you bought wisely. So, in and of itself, it's a decent gaming laptop and you won't likely be able to find much better in the way of internal specs (CPU/GPU/RAM) for this same price, but you will find some with better screens and the same CPU/GPU that also have a 2nd M.2 slot for adding another SSD. It's up to each individual buyer to decide of these things are a big deal to them or not.Pros+Roughly the same price as other systems using a R7 plus a 3050TiNice, large trackpad and a good, backlit keyboard3050ti is configured at 75 watts (not the highest possible but close)HDMI port is version 2.1Nondescript chassis might be appealing to people who want/need a dedicated GPU without RGB and an over the top designCons-Screen is only 250 nits of brightness and 45% NTSC (you should get 100% sRGB and 300-350 nits of brightness for $1100 with these specs)No USB C chargingAll USB ports are limited to 5 Gigabits per secondNo way to add more storage short of replacing the drive that has Windows installed on it. What’s worse is that there was a place on the logic board for a second M.2 slot but HP chose not to install it on this version.There are other laptops for this price with the same specs, better screens, and with 2x NVMe M.2 slots for more storage (which equals more room to store games)Update: I realized that virtualization based security was enabled on this laptop, if you turn the “core isolation/memory integrity” slider to off in the Windows Security application, performance for gaming will increase by a substantial margin. My score in 3D mark went up by several hundred points.",0
"I am very satisfied with this little laptop. It is everything that was said, lightweight, simple to figure out and easy to manage. I only use this for home use, but I have always loved HP's, so you can't go wrong with buying this one. The delivery was 2 days, and even the box was in nice shape.",0
Sound is awesome. I've had many computers and laptops and this is the BEST sounding one EVER. It is CLEARLY in STEREO. Also love that it has a number pad on the keyboard & back-lit keyboard.,0
"I bought with the intention to swap out harddrive but there is no access panels. To get to either the HD or ram you need to remove the entire back panel, 4 screws plus 7 hidden screws and the whole thing is clipped around the edges. Also filled with tons of bloat but I expected that buying from HP. If you ever want to upgrade or swap parts and don't want to mess with that then I recommend a different laptop, if you don't mind that part, it seems pretty solid though it only has the basics.Edit: Just realized the screen resolution is 768 and not 1080 but that wasn't listed anywhere on the product page. Minus another star for that.",0
"This is the first gaming/ high tech laptop I have ever owned. Previously I had only ever used Toshiba laptops with 4-6 GB of RAM and not great graphics cards. I finally decided to upgrade because I needed something more powerful to run Adobe Lightroom without crippling lag and freezing screens. The bonus ability to use VR is also a perk I wasn't going to turn down either. I can't really rate the ""Value for Money"" since I have not previously spent this kind of money on a laptop, and it was a Black Friday deal so who knows exactly what the mark down was, but for ~$2000 including a square trade 4 year protection plan I would make the purchase again.So far the MSI Leopard has been amazing. I was surprised and impressed with the size, weight and build. The keyboard is solid, no give or flexibility to the keys, and I get to pick the colors for the LED's! The screen has strong hinges and the power chord is a monster. The only thing I wish was different was the location of the FN key. It's way over by the left CTRL while the volume and brightness keys are overlayed on the arrow keys so my average sized hand isn't long enough to reach FN and the adjustment keys.*Update* after just under 2 years the case is being held together with duct tape, epoxy, binder clips and thin wood braces because of various cracks in the bottom and sides of the laptop. The laptop managed to go a year and a half with no physical damage but the past 4 months more and more cracks have been appearing despite attempts to reinforce weak areas. More recently the plastic by the right hinge snapped and flew everywhere, now whenever the screen is lifted up or put down I hear a peeling sound and am trying to find a way to hold the screen frame together without getting it stuck open or closed. The laptop has been used almost daily but has never been dropped or handled roughly, I can only surmise the damage is due to the laptop running hot. Rather disappointed that my 8 year old Toshiba managed to outlast my (almost) 2 year old MSI in structural integrity. Have to decide now how much money I want to sink into trying to repair the case for an otherwise perfectly working laptop, or try another brand as I read case cracks and hinges breaking after frequent use is not an uncommon problem with MSI...",0
Is this computer good for Diablo live?,0
"The laptop is great! It runs very well and smooth every game I've tried on it... However it get really hot! Temperatures go above 90 degrees, but it can be fixed by undervolting the battery a little without loosing performance.",0
Perfect for what I needed for. I don’t think this is touchscreen,0
"I'm coming from a 2008 Sony Vaio so this was a major upgrade. I only use it for programming and it's lightning fast, having SSD really helps. It looks premium and I have no problems with build, also keyboard flex is not an issue nor is the power button placement. I definitely recommend for the price, you can't beat it.I bought this in May 2018 and I have to replace the battery, pretty short lifespan but I am sure the average battery for this computer will last longer. -1 star.",0
This new computer was a Christmas gift for our daughter and it is perfect for her daily use.,0
"Been using it for a month already, almost daily and it's just remarkable. Is a fast, good looking and light pc. Before buying did like 3 months research on most of the pc available on different brands, read so many reviews and view a lot of videos recommending new pc's. So, bottom line, I made the right buy.",0
"Great laptop, high performance for workstation and graphics tasks.",0
The laptop is poorly refurbished with just stickers to hide the wear and tear marks.Processing is too slow if you are using it for anything except normal browsing. I try to analyze some data on excel and the laptop freezes. I restarted the laptop several times before giving up the idea of opening up an excel while browsing on chrome.,0
"Overall the performance is great, solid 60 FPS in nearly every modern game and runs smooth Adobe Premiere, After Effects and PhotoShop.The screen isn't the brightest but it's very reasonable considering the super budget price.The battery life lasts about 3:30 hours of internet browsing/watching videos. While gaming battery drains quickly. Play plugged.The speakers are poor. Low sound quality and weak volume. There is a pre-installed program called Waves Maxxaudio that increases the sound volume & quality but it's still meh. Easily fixed tho with headphones/external speakers.For this price, it's probably the best gaming laptop you could buy. But in 2020 i'd wait for the newer gen that might come with stronger GPU or get the 2020 version which comes with a newer processor (10th gen over 9th gen)",0
I love it.,0
"Best purchase ever. I love the larger screen compared to my last chromebook that had a 11.6"" screen. It's lightweight and sturdy.",0
"This is my first MacBook and I like it for the price, but touchbar isa bit weird. As i find out this is not fault apple just have this kind of touchbars. I had acer predator helios 300 before this and it has much better toucbar. Much comfortable in every aspect.",0
This laptop is fast and very responsive though it takes awhile getting it there so make sure you go through the Windows 10 settings with an fine toothed comb.,0
"This is a beauty! I'm an architect and Even I have not order the model with the highest specs, this baby is a monster!!! ? really loved every single part of it. This does not have an integrated web cam. It does not have camera. Which I loved lolI may say volume and bass is not the best but with some Great speakers, booommm!!Keyboard is soft, precisely delicated.The keypad is now on the mouse pad, which is weird but good!!! Love it when you get use to it!Recommended!!!",0
Only thing I would say is you definitely need more storage and ram probably a ssd for it and it does get loud so you’ll need a laptop cooling stand as well or something to prop the laptop up so increase air intake,0
I bought this computer for my kid in 2019 and it lasted a lot longer than expected. Will buy Asus again.,0
"Very pleased with this laptop in terms of speed, noise level, and features. There is a slight amount of light bleed around the edges of the screen, but I don't use it in a dark room so it really isn't a problem for me. One of the reasons I chose this model was for ease of access for a SSD addition as a secondary drive; very straightforward. (I didn't have to remove the motherboard like some competitors do.)",0
Big power on a small footprint.,0
The screen is really amazing.,0
"This laptop is a beast. On Turbo it is loud, but on performance it's quiet even if being pushed relatively hard. and if Asus Armoury Crate to be believed, the heat is fine. It is also CERTAINLY not hot. Compared to some real furnaces that would burn my hand I've had in the past, this is nothing.I have this as a desktop replacement and for the money, this thing is definitely future proofed. 3070TI, with a 12th Gen I9, is a great combo.It does do some funky things on battery though. I would avoid purchasing this for travel.Very happy with my purchase. And this is upgradeable. I can put another SSD, or another stick of ram in it no sweat.On the topic of Ram, 16GB gets eaten up REAL fast Even though it's DDR5.Great laptop!!!!",0
"As the headline leads on, I bought the 12th Gen i7 version RTX 3070 of the Pulse GL66. It DOES NOT have a 2.5 inch space or slot. It does however has a second NVME slot for storage next to the battery plug when you open it up; please buy a NVME if you plan to expand storage. It may not read the first time. Look for guides online for command prompt and diskpart for the laptop to read the extra NVME. (: Otherwise, it's a great laptop I managed to get a a bargain. Step up from my i7 8th gen GTX 1060 laptop I've had for a few years.",0
I love the my laptop. Easy to use light weight,0
I have to use external speakers to hear anything. It turns this laptop into a desktop basically,0
the setup was so easy and was spelled out every step of the way,0
The computer works fine and Im happy with my purchase. The box does smell like mold? I saw other reviewers post prior to purchasing - just thought I’d mention it’s def a thing. No issues with the computer itself so far. I haven’t had it long though.,0
"I bought this laptop to dip my toes in the water for PC gaming and also to use as a personal PC for emails, browsing the web, etc. I used a separate monitor as I wasn't using this as a mobile gaming set-up. The version I got with the i7 and 3060 laptop GPU was great for warzone. I was able to run well above standard graphics on Warzone at about 100FPS. I never had any issues with overheating, although I did buy a cheap ""fan deck"" to put the laptop on. The fan isn't quiet, but that is to be expected with any gaming laptop, especially when under stress. I have since bought a full gaming desktop as I realized I did want to fully make the jump from console to PC but I gave this laptop to my wife who plays the Sims and Age of Empires and she has seen HUGE performance boosts compared to her older Asus Nitro 5. Her games run much smoother on this laptop. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get into pc gaming or someone that is looking for a multi-use portable PC. Be sure to check the specs and reviews for the specific model you're buying as Amazon shows reviews for similar pcs with different internal specs.",0
I use this for work. It retains the battery life pretty well - 8 hours or so working on it all day.I got the pen to go with it.The keyboard allows me to adjust the volume and screen brightness.,0
Powerfull small size,0
Amazing laptop for the price. Won't run a new full priced game at highest quality settings but worth it when you're somewhat on a budget,0
"This is an awesome laptop. I use it almost daily. Great with Microsoft products (word, excel, etc), did not disappoint!!",0
"This 17 inch Envy laptop is great for school. The Full HD Touchscreen on this laptop looks amazing and with a high screen resolution, there's enough onscreen room to work with. This Envy laptop is speedy and logging in with Windows Hello is awesome, just look at the camera and you're in. The backlit keyboard is cool too. Overall, a great built laptop that will handle tasks well.",0
"FURIOUS. Bought for elderly mother in April '21 but didn't activate until Sept '21 due to her hospitalization. In March '22, the machine started acting up (would turn off suddenly) until later that month the Chrome OS crashed. Contacted Lenovo's ""awesome"" customer service and they dumped it off onto Google (I get that it's a software issue), which only has web support (i.e., no human beings). Followed prompts to reinstall Chrome OS via online support but all it gave me was a black screen. Consulted online forums and tried their suggestions to no avail. Of course, since it's out of warranty (even though it was only used maybe two dozen times for about an hour each), the Chromebook is a black-screen paperweight. Several computer repair shops offered to fix for more than the machine is worth. Never again. Lenovo lost my business FOREVER. Could have saved me as a customer if they offered even the tiniest of support.",0
"The instrument asks me to rate the touch screen, but I don't use it. I would gladly buy one without a touch screen if I could save money. The computer runs like a champ. The first two or three times I booted it up, it was slow because of software updates, but since then, it's been good and fast. I purchased this laptop mainly for photo editing; it works well with Photoshop Elements. The description says the keyboard is backlit, but mine is not. Not a feature that's important to me, but it may be to some. I especially like the 17-inch screen combined with the portability of a laptop.",0
"This model number, 81JW0001US, does not have a FHD (1920x1080) screen. The resolution of this model number, 81JW0001US, is HD (1366x768) which is absolutely awful for a 14"" screen.Lenovo does offer a chromebook S330 with FHD (1920x1080) resolution -- that model is the 81JW000EUS and is listed on their website for $279.99 as of 6/12/2019.It does not look like the FHD model (which also comes with 64GB of storage, not the 32GB listed here) is currently available on Amazon.All the above being said, if you know for a fact that you will not be bothered by the low resolution of the screen, this is actually a pretty good buy for the price. Lenovo lists their HD (1366x768) S330 for $249.99. I have the Lenovo C330 (same internal specs and screen resolution as this model, but with a touchscreen) and it can run android applications and output Netflix fairly well to a 4K TV.",0
"Thermals are great, GPU never exceeded 71c at 100% usage, no throttling that i was aware of.",0
I ordered mine on the 12th and received it on the 17th. I have not had a new laptop since I bought my MacBook Pro back in 2014. This laptop is actually thinner than I expected for all the cooling and specs it has. I expected a thick brick like the gaming laptop I owned before my MacBook Pro. years ago. The keyboard RGB looks really good but can also be toned down or turned off too ( lots of options) if you happen to get tired of it. The CPU and GPU seem to be top notch for this price. It seem if you wanted to get anything better you need to spend a lot more money and the 2070 should be able to handle everything currently you can throw at it. I do kind of wish it came with a thunderbolt port but I guess that was something they had to leave out to make the specs this good for this price point.,0
"But, I love this laptop. After asking multiple people who have purchased the same (or better) models and I couldn't be happier purchasing even the lowest end model of MacBook Air. Does everything I would expect an Apple Computer to do (for what I need it for, basic photo editing, viewing, and typing). So far it's been an amazing purchase. Just for the sake of keeping Apple on their toes I rated the Battery Life 4 stars and the camera quality 4 stars, as well as the 4 star overall review. Keep it up Apple, as long as you continue to make the products user-friendly I'll remain a happy customer for years to come.",0
Es súper ligera pero potente. El ventilador se enciende constantemente pero en lo personal no me molesta.,0
"Considering monitors are rather expensive, this is good for the price.",0
"I ordered this product with free shipping and it actually arrived 2-3 days earlier which I really appreciate. I’m inlove with the keyboard because you can adjust the backlight and that’s what I was really looking towards. The cooling system isn’t the best, it does heat up when playing games. Just make sure you have it on a flat surface and not cloth. Also the speakers aren’t very loud but it’s very do-able for the price. I would recommend in a heart beat.",0
"Pretty good laptop, my only criticism against it is just a bit bulky and heavy and the fans get pretty loud. But other than that it runs games very well.",0
amazing quality screen 144hz 3ms response time is a game changer.,0
"Excellent gaming laptop. Was available for $1,400, which is a great value for the sum of its parts.Gaming - this is what its for. The 2070 RTX card benchmarks at around the previous gen's 1080 GTX, although it's supposed to have optimized support for ray-tracing (I've not seen that yet, don't have any games that have that feature). The 10th gen i7 is a slightly better version of my 7th gen i7, which 6 cores instead of four. in short, this is a slightly better computer than my 3 year old gamer rig only its way more mobile. It's not a Switch, you'll have to plug in the laptop to get the most out of modern games, but it's perfect when it's plugged in.You'll want a gaming mouse, a headset, and a controller to go with this. If you have a second monitor, I'd recommend a G-sync or FreeSync monitor to make sure you're not letting any of those precious frames go to waste.Nitpicks -Speakers are quiet, fan is loud. When the fan is blasting, it becomes difficult to hear what's going on in the game. Can't do much about the fan - you've got to cool the GPUs and CPUs. They could have made the speakers a bit louder, or maybe they could have placed them in a better position. It's a minor gripe, just wear a headset.",0
No HDR on output,0
The fan wobbled and made loud grating noises against the case when tilting the laptop.When looking into things online this seemed like a somewhat common problem.,0
"Great little computer for a casual user. Highly recommend if you're simply using for web surfing, email, music, etc. Also has the added bonus of now running apps from the Google play store.",0
Quality price is exelent,0
"En general es buena y eficiente, y si les sirve de algo: Si corre GTA V sin ningún problema, a buenos gráficos y sin lag.Pero a tan solo 2 días de tenerla, ya no me dejó arrancar windows ;-;Intenté solucionarlo con las opciones que da pero nada, tuve que restaurarla de fábrica, algo absurdo para solo haberla tenido conmigo 2 días. Si vuelve a ocurrir lamentablemente tendré que devolverla.",0
Idk if it’s just this laptop but my screen is going nuts and glitches roughly 24/7. Or is it that this is how chrome books design is ? Idk a bit disappointed tho,0
one month in and it's constantly noisy. even after factory reset. so annoying.Update:solved the noise problem! it came with macafee anti virus which hogged the CPU and the computer resources! after removing it the problem solved completely.,0
"The XIDU MAX provides 5 -6 hours of convenient battery power, good for the road traveler who doesn't always have an available connection.",0
"Great product. Specs as expected. Not light as ultrabook but still very portable (4 lb)Big plus:- huge and fantastic screen display (better than my surface book 1) despite the 1920x1080 resolution, not sure what new technology is that.- top cover not so shiny as previous models, which I like a lot.",0
Not enough hard drive space on this device. I will be installing a 1TB SSD on Tuesday.,0
Get this computer for all intents and purposes! I bought it for IT and database administration and I just wanted a computer who could think for me. This is it. Along with its long computer time and screen life,0
"got very excited when got it, open and plug in the charger and turned it on. worked for 30 minute to an hour (not too sure) then suddenly the screen went black. the keyboard is still lit up, but the screen was just completely dead black. i turned it off then on, noticing only the keyboard working (lights up) but the fan stops working after a few seconds and screen still black. i check the charger and see that the laptop is charging so nothing wrong there. i tried to look up solutions and tutorials and called the company, but nothing worked. they told me to send it to them to repair it, but my parents disagreed and wants to return it. not sure what to do since i only have to option which’s to return it or keep looking up solutions. i really wanna keep this laptop since i’ve always kept my eye on it but i’m going through a mental breakdown trying to fix it on my own with my parents not supporting the idea of sending it to the company for them to repair and rather return it. if someone has a solution on here please help me ?.",0
La laptop traia un borde golpeado,0
Worked well... For a while...,0
"Amazed that it uploaded all my files and I for from cloud. Just turned it on and it worked, syncing with phones and iPad ????",0
The speakers are the best Laptop speakers i have ever had,0
Great laptop for the value,0
"Purchased for grandkids, largely to write Scratch programs. Excellent laptop all around. Good keyboard and display, quick, light weight, easy setup, WIn 10S (easily converted to WIn 10). Also purchased a 64GB microSD (useful), wireless mouse (useful), wireless keyboard (not needed), and laptop sleeve (not needed). If you put Documents on the microSD, 32GB is plenty, unless you need a lot of space for additional apps.",0
great product however not a touch screen as discribed,0
Brought this for my Wife.... she hook it up and started using it moments after opening the box. The laptop is fast and able to show videos without lag-time. Its fast and easy to use....THE WIFE LOVES IT AND VERY PLEASED!,0
Muy buena la cálidad de la laptop,0
"There is a lot of internet issues with it, not my Internet my internet is good but the WiFi card I think it’s called is so bad, I’m having a lot of problems with games and stuff just please buy a computer and a desk, my fps in games and stuff I don’t know why it’s bad, I would wake up than some of my games fps would be weird, I think I need to clean it I don’t know, plus if you’re playing a game with high fps graphics etc. if you don’t have a your charger plugged in the computer will die in 50 minutes and the game will freeze a lot and other stuff",0
The cpu fan started wearing down and now makes a buzzing noise,0
chrome books are way faster than notebooks and more reliable for most of what i use them for. this is the second chromebook i have owned both acer and i have not been dissapointed in either of them.,0
This laptop is very light. I love it.,0
"For what I paid for it, I think its a nice laptop. I disagree that the cooling is noisy. even with the fans ramped up to speed it's not that bad. I like the backlit keyboard. I like that it has room for expansion. I ordered a second pcie nvme wd black sn850 intending to dual boot ubuntu, and installed that. very fast drive. I also ordered a second 8gb of ram and installed that. and since I had the bottom cover off anyways I installed a 2.5""hdd that had a bunch of stuff I use already on it. It's been 2 weeks with it and seems to run pretty good. I did have to spend a little more to make it what I want, but it's still a good machine before I upgraded it.",0
"I waited a few months to review. Use this for streaming, nice big screen, and poking around on line.The big keyboard isnt comfortable for me and the keys aren't back lighted but not a deal breaker for me. If you are a student or someone doing a lot of typing or at night, just something to consider.Excellent value and price. Would buy again.",0
It may replace my iPad Pro 11” based on my use so far.,0
"I have to reset this thing at least 5 times per week in the middle of meetings and such for no reason. I've done all the updates and it's brand new, it just doesn't work. I'm guessing this has to do with the fact that it has an Apple chip instead of an Intel one, and like most things Apple actually makes its glitchy and unreliable. Makes sense that it was on sale. If you have to buy an Apple try to get the ones that have the fewest Apple parts as possible.",0
very slow from day 1 would never buy again,0
"Almost as new, clean, battery taking full charge, window 10, its just a great lap tob.",0
Came in with a broken GPU fan. It is suppose to turn on when you start gaming but mine wouldn’t and the GPU would reach 90c which is way too hot. Other than that it was awesome and ran games fine.,0
This computer is perfect for what we purchased it for. 100% satisfied with it.,0
the speakers are pretty bad,0
"Este dispositivo es muy bueno y ofrece buenas prestaciones para lo que cuesta.-Muy buena pantalla en colores, resolución y a 144hz-La batería rinde como se espera de una laptop gamer-El rendimiento con el Ryzen 7 es fantástico-La gtx 1060 ti rinde de maravilla aunque para jugar a 1080 ultra puede necesitar un poco mas de potencia en juegos muy demandantesEdit 21/02/2021Hace dos dias me encontraba leyendo un pdf, luego quise reproducir un video en Youtube y ponerlo en pantalla completa, y de repente la pantalla se congelo aparecieron lineas diagonales de color rosado y blanco , la computadora se apago, trate de encenderla pero solo el teclado se iluminaba y parece q la pantalla se enciende.Edit 01/03/2021Como ya paso un mes Amazon me dijo que no podian hacer nada por mi q me comunique con Lenovo, y Lenovo me ha respondido que como no me encuentro en USA no pueden hacer valida la garantia.LA COMPUTADORA ES BUEN EQUIPO, LASTIMOSAMENTE DESDE ENTONCES ME HE QUEDADO CON LA LAPTOP COMO UN ADORNO DE SALA NO FUNCIONA, SI NO VIVE DENTRO DE USA NO RECIVIRA MUCHA AYUDA.",0
"This laptop originally came w/ Win10 S which was supposed to be secure & fast but only allowed apps from the Microsoft Store. After transitioning to a FULL VERSION of Win 10 Home Edition, I have to shut off any extra features in the system tray just to operate at a ""normal"" speed w/out waiting. Excel can barely highlight cells to clear data or whatever. The solid state drive is cool and I trust the HP name... Make sure whatever you get has all the RAM you need to operate, esp. if you plan to upgrade to Win 11 coming out soon. One RAM vendor's site couldn't diagnose IF this laptop could take more or is upgradeable or not. My daughter can use this laptop for Minecraft, etc., however you my have to click click click the mouse to hit your next button.",0
"This has a tough, industrial feel but still looks good. Its a no nonsense machine that gets the job done right. Great combination of specs and a hinge that actually works if you want to go into tablet mode. I get this for my clients and my own family.",0
"There was nothing to dislike, it operates perfect. It's just not the most powerful, the processing is two generations old with the i7 and the HDMI has lag from laptop to screen inputs about a second or more of lag from PC to HDMI connected screen. Several crashes even on turbo and low frame games that are 2D. As for portable gaming it's the best low end you can get for the price though it should already have the extra ram and ssd installed.",0
The touchPAD on the laptop can handle all sorts of 1-4 finger gestures.,0
"This laptop is great. The only thing I don't like about it is the Aorus Control Center software which feels like an overzealous anti-virus with the things it meddles with. BUT once I setup my RGB keyboard pattern, I uninstalled it and it's good to go, you don't really need it to begin with.",0
Was hoping to replace my desktop but it lacked the needed software.,0
It plays better than my Razor which cost a few hundred dollars more than my daughter's Lenovo,0
This MSI laptop has been great so far! It is fast and will handle most games at ease that you will throw at it. It runs cool and the fans are much quieter compared to my old gaming laptop. The full size keyboard is great and the RGB lights are really cool. But.. the battery life! It's not as described. I got less than 3 hours of mixed use before I had to plug it in.,0
Very happy with this chromebook.,0
"I consider myself a light gamer, playing simulation/ world building/management games like Cities Skylines, Tropico 5, Sims 4/3, Project Highrise & this computer takes everything you throw at it.",0
The laptop fan working with screen death look like the BIOS not working please guide me if this can be fixed or should I return this laptop back to you and cancel the order,0
So pleased with this purchase.,0
"This laptop is great! The best bang for the buck, and it cost quite a few bucks...",0
"Great computer for what I need, had to take it out of S mode and I'll have to upgrade the ram (easy to do) but overall a great budget computer",0
It works perfect and easy to set up. I had a smaller one and Google loaded all I needed on my new one,0
"its nice, compact and powerful for on the go assignments and gaming.",0
"This is a good, basic laptop for work or homework.I got this for the resident 11 year old. She handled all the set up herself - I didn't have to touch it - so it's pretty easy and intuitive to set up.Does not have the power/speed for intense gaming, but works well for streaming.She's happy with this.",0
My first new Apple product. Very fast and now I am in learning mode. Buy this unit.,0
so far this seems to do the job I want it to--I don't game so mainly I just use it for a few purposes,0
"As the headline states, the little laptop provides great performance for the price. I've been playing games like Borderland's 3 and Doom Eternal on medium-high settings with zero issues. Framerates are buttery smooth. Furthermore, the installed software, like MSI Dragon center, allow me to monitor the system and has settings to prevent the battery from overcharging when left plugged in.My only criticisms are the battery life and the speakers. I only get about 2-2.5 hours of battery life when unplugged. Which is about average with most makes and models at this price point. The sound coming from the speakers is a little ""tinny,"" and lacks bass. However, given what I paid, it's really nothing to complain about. Besides, it can be solved with 3rd party speakers. Other than those two criticisms, the laptop is awesome!In closing, I'm more than satisfied with my purchase and when the time comes to replace the laptop, I'll buy another MSI product.",0
Remember that the Windows version is in window S mode.,0
This computer freezes constantly. I used it for literally one day and it froze at least a dozen times. It's also not easy to use. I am returning this.,0
I just received the laptop. It's excellent overall fast and performs really well. The build quality is also quite solid for the price. I saw many reviews about temps but the temps are quite acceptable. Idle the CPU sits around 45 degrees in a room around 26 degrees and under load such as gaming in performance mode the Cpu get around 80 and Gpu stays below 75.,0
Fans do a great job keeping the system cool,0
"My job is Senior Business Intelligence Developer and Analyst, and I'm working remotely. To say this laptop is good for students but not for business use is just false. I'm able to do absolutely everything without lag and without issues. In my spare time, I also do music using Soundtrap. I plug a USB keyboard and microphone/guitar interface into this laptop and I'm able to create multi-track songs. My caps lock does have an indicator light that works, and I have zero complaints or issues. Maybe some people are reviewing an earlier model? I purchased mine in February of 2022, and the OS is Windows 11 Home. Actually, I bought 2; One for me and one for a family member who does graphics with Gimp. The laptops are great and we have no complaints.",0
"I really dislike this computer. Little memory, can't load small games. Unfixable errors and explanations of ways to fix it does not offer much help. The mouse port and power cord ports both broke. Never again.",0
"I bought this laptop for the second time, the first one arrived with a broken screen, I returned it, once the refund was completed I bought this one and arrived with a broken trackpad. Maybe it's a sign from the gods I can't have this laptop, but I bought this laptop two times and I received both defective.I am done with razer and maybe laptops in general with Amazon.",0
"Nothing super impressive & certainly not for gaming or anything, but for light activities like browsing the internet or watching something on Netflix, it gets the job done",0
Faster than the Windows machine it replaced. $208 is a good price for everything I need in a computer.,0
"Quite nice laptop. Arrived in its original package with all all the stickers and the power brick. Been using & testing every inches of it since 14 June 2022, absolute amazed & don't regret buying this laptop at all. Totally worth the money I spent on this laptop.About the thunderbolt port, didn't get the chance to test it yet. About the screen, there is not much bleeding, the color & brightness is ok, however don't update to the latest intel UHD graphic driver as it will render the screen color & brightness totally inaccurate, had to revert back to the old version. The performance is incredible, didn't test the MUX switch yet. The keyboard & touchpad is quite nice, everything placed perfectly, the RGB & its brightness is quite nice, sad that it doesn't support per-key RGB.Runs a little bit hot with the fan a little bit loud when doing stuff like gaming & other things that requires high processing power, but that's OK, It is bearable.Had an issue with the microphone as was too loud & inaccurate in the receiver end, had to use an earphone with external mic. Thought it was a hardware issue, but after a bit of research, uninstalled the C-Media Audio Driver & reinstalled all of it through My Asus software. Easy process & now works perfectly.",0
Its really a great laptop. Overall good for playing. The only thing that would need improvement would be the battery life.,0
Works great and is fast. I would buy again.,0
"Email, shopping, stresming",0
Waited for this thing to come.so excited when it arrived. Got it charged up turned on power and nothing but a white screen.also noticed the screen has a scuff like scratch. Bought brand new and disappointed.,0
"very satisfied, good lap top for general use for the money.",0
"The MacBook Air is as advertised. Fast and easy to use with a long battery life. Too few ports for my taste, and the keyboard is only OK. I use a Logitech mouse via Bluetooth, and it is responsive. One positive surprise is that the speakers in the laptop are better than those I've used in bigger machines.",0
Love everything about it! Battery life is fantastic!,0
FAST... Very FastQuiet....Very QuietRuns Very Cool.....ZERO overheating like some have claimed Perfect Touch pad Excellent Keyboard Excellent Sound Quality considering the bottom mount speakers ..Fantastic Design and Style 512 SSD is Plenty for a boot and software..Available SSD Drive Space is Perfect for Adding any Needed Space for Large Game FilesAvailable HDD Drive Space is Excellent for even MORE Data Storage if Needed If you've been looking for a lighting FAST laptop with Upgrade Options... LOOK NO FURTHER...,0
"My first review was to return it but since it was good for value, I decided to keep it. However the laptop is heating a lot, I fear it will burn out because the CPU temperatures go quite high and very noisy. The cooling is not enough, you can't even touch the upper side of the keyboard because of heat. I fear it might malfunction soon because of melting of some pieces inside. I just play total war by the way so it's not super high graphic needs, if I play a FPS I think the computer will burn. So, overall good speed and graphics but bad sound, bad keyboard lights and extremely bad cooling.",0
"Terrible, absolutely terrible.. Low amount of storage that is eaten up in no time by Microsoft Windows updates and various other Microsoft bloatware, can't seem to install anything because it has such low storage, if you do happen to install an application, good luck getting it to run properly. Terrible! Do not buy!",0
"Decent computer, I had the i7-12650H with GTX 3060 model. Computer overheats so much even just idling. It got to the point where any sort of heavy load made it inoperable. I had to buy a separate cooling pad just to use the laptop so now I have to carry that thing along as well. Also only have has 500 GB of storage which filled up after 4 games but it’s to be expected (upgradable though).",0
Original problem solved. “ Boot Device not found.” Changed the original boot configuration to UEFI. Product checks good.,0
"Took me buying and returning 3 computers to land on this gem. A back-lit keyboard, at last. I’ve only had it about a week, but I feel like this computer is worth twice the price. I also want to thank the seller for being so responsive to my issue (literally got back to me a minute later). Very kind and professional. 5 stars for sure.",0
"EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, PERFECTO ESTADO - ECUADOR.",0
"I have a MacBook Pro 2017 fully loaded.. 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 4 USB-C Thunderbolt ports and Touch Bar.. this MacBook Air blows it away !! And it's the base model ! 8Gb and 256 SSD.. I am going to pass down my MacBook Pro or sell it.. these new M1/M2 Macs are way faster than the intel versions.. I sat them side by side and ran the same programs.. the MBA 2022 beat the MBP 2017 every time.. That's not saying the MBP is not a great computer I used it for 5 years. I even now it is a great computer for pro tasks.. because it is very cheap.. you can buy my 2017 on Amazon for about $450.. ya that's right.. and I took the $150 discount on Amazon for the new MBA.. It was well worth it.. this sucker is fast !! You can get a 30 day return policy from some vendors,, I suggest you try it if your not a supper power user.. and you will have the latest M2 chip and OS! Apple will eventually drop the intel compatibility to move forward.. it could be next year or 3 years,. but they will move forward.. Oh my wife still uses a 2013 MBP 15 inch.. ya they last that long.. I am giving her my MBP 2017 so she can have the new OS Ventura..",0
This is a great laptop and fulfils my expectations of speed and uncluttered access to the internet. Would have given a 5 star had it not been for a couple of upper case keys which don't do their specified function. Example: The '@' key and the inverted commas key are mixed up. Otherwise a perfect machine.,0
My first Acer Chromebook. Easy to set up. I added a mouse because that works better for me. Like not having to buy security . Would purchase again,0
Great product for school work!! I am a college student and wanted something small to take on the go! It is just what I was looking for.,0
"OK just a few notes. The computer runs well but a few side notes:Although the GTX 1050 TI is now listed as being the minimum recommended for VR, it is NOT VR ready. A test by Occulus Rift program shows it to not meet the minimum requirements.The computer uses a dual display driver system. This means that not all games will utilize the Nvidia GTX 1050 TI card. It may utilize the Intel 630 and run Nvidia for the Physics only. (though I bench-marked this system with both Valley and Furmark, the individual game will ultimately decide which card will run when playing. You can select the Physics to run Nvidia under global or application. I.E. Fallout 4 will default to the on-board Intel 630 GFX processor. This doesn't mean that it does not run well it does, you are simply not getting all the optimization from the GTX 1050 TI Card.)Furthermore the Nvidia Ge-force Experience program will not run with this system currently. I am looking into this further with Nvidia. Apparently in its 2d running state the program cannot detect the 1050 TI and therefore will not optimize anything.For the prices this is a very good mid-range",0
Works great!,0
"For the things described in the product main page, it does absolute everything!!! must buy for a great cheap price, and great specs for that price, just add an SD Card and get that storage edge you need and you are just set for your daily tasks.",0
I recommends... the best... I'm happy with my laptop...,0
Calidad,0
Good product. Keyboard letter “D” gets stuck a little but other than that laptop works very well!,0
"It is a very solid gaming laptop, very good thermal, fan is not loud even on turbo, you can turn it to balance or silent mode without heating the laptop. The screen is the best, RGB is great but you can completely turn it off to avoid having that bad gamer impression.",0
"I only purchased this chromebook for backup, to use when I travel. I don't like the fact that you cannot download apps, and the touch screen. However I also purchased a mouse to use.",0
"I upgraded from an ASUS G55VW for more portability and performance. I initially did not want to purchase another ASUS as the customer service I received on my last was very shoddy. However, the specs and aesthetics of this model had me coming back. I've been in the market for a slim, light-weight, gaming laptop that was reliable and did not look like red, flaming school bus. This laptop hit the mark right on the money. It fits inside any bag and looks just like a macbook. It is a little more plasticy than a macintosh, but still feels sturdy. I like the addition of the numpad as I work with numbers and spreadsheets on a daily basis.The speakers (harman/kardon) are the best I've ever heard on a laptop. I can comfortably watch movies and YouTube videos at home without headphones. Spotify tracks also come through very clear.The laptop does not have a long battery life, but the charge time is surprisingly fast. I haven't timed it, but I'm able to plug it back in and have it fully charged without me even realizing it.I've played GTA V and Left 4 Dead 2 on highest quality so far and they both get a consistent 60 FPS without much heat. Fan noise isn't very loud, especially with the nice speakers. I'll probably update this review when I try some more demanding games out.The track pad can get a little jumpy at times, maybe for a couple minutes. I'm not sure what the cause of it is, but it's only a slight annoyance. It's pretty smooth and responsive the other 98% of the time.The screen is kind of lackluster. As others have said, the viewing angles are pretty narrow, but I honestly don't mind it too much. I've played around with MacBooks before and can say they're much better, but just about everything else on this laptop makes up for it.I'm pretty happy with my purchase, can't really suggest any changes about the laptop. After living with the last laptop for 5 years and all of its small annoyances, I'm very satisfied with the upgrade. I only recently graduated from college, but can say I would have loved to have this for taking to class or the library. Something that was very awkward and not very practical to do with the ASUS G55VW.",0
"I just got my laptop which is suppose to have RBG keyboard lighting but, instead I got its $1099 version all because of a sticker. I made sure I bought the correct model I wanted and I also checked the box. What was messed up was that there was another sticker over the original box which shad the info of some of the specs and what model it is. What I got the the PH315 52 78VL while the model I wanted was the PH 315 52 72RG. How can they mess this up?! If they double checked both stickers this wouldn’t have been a problem.*EDIT* 11/24/2019:So this basically how my return went. I talked to Amazon and the only thing that they could do is let me return the package and once it got to their facility is when they can refund me. I live in Hawaii so the time it got to Amazon took awhile and it wasn't priority shipping. Took around a week. Anyway I was displeased about waiting that long that but I understand since I live quite a bit aways.So after getting my refund, and reordering the same exact laptop from the same seller, they finally gave me the right laptop in about 3 days. After using the laptop for a couple weeks a few things right off the bat is that this gaming on this laptop is amazing. For reference, I was playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare on Ultra settings on every little thing I can get put it on and I was able to max 150 fps but average about 110-120 fps on turbo mode. Without turbo mode, you would a get a solid 90 fps. Keep in mind while using turbo, increases how loud the laptop gets with its fans and it can get pretty loud. ALSO FOR THOSE WONDERING YOU CAN USE VR WITH THIS LAPTOP. I was able to play VR Chat with the Oculus Quest with the Oculus Link software and a 3rd party USB 3.0 cable. Runs like a dream but have to test more games withing the PC Oculus App and try Steam VR soon. The camera quality, mic quality, and speaker quality are all sub-par but, it is a gaming laptop so I had no issues with all of these since it could be fixed with a webcam if needed and most gamers would use a headset with a mic anyway.On the outside, this PC can get hot especially on the keyboard but, wasn't bothersome for me. The fans vents are placed on both sides of the laptop and not under, releasing quite a bit of heat. Also I found that the charging port seems to block the left fan vent, so to give the laptop optimal cooling I just placed the laptop on the side of a desk and just flipped the charger downwards. When it comes to battery life with this laptop, it runs well on gaming when plugged in. However, gaming without a charging really drains the battery. Gave me about 2 hours although I could've lowered the brightness, turned off the rgb keyboard, and set the battery to ""Best battery life"" rather then ""Best performance"". The keyboard took a bit of getting used to. Coming from a 15"" macbook pro was not too bad. I say this because Acer added the keypad on the right of laptop and sort squishing the regular keyboard making it a smaller. than the macbook keys. I was a bit put off by it but easily got used to it and can type just as fast as I did before.Other than that, I would've gave this overall view 4 because of the mishap in the beginning of this purchase but because I was very impressed on how well the laptop runs , I give it a 5/5. It is a great gaming laptop by all means and if you want to upgrade the hard drive storage you're able to. It can be used as a regular everyday laptop and give significant amount of battery life (on the right settings). When it comes to a gaming this has to be by far one of the best bang for your buck laptops out there.",0
"I got this laptop for the screen quality and because of good ratings. I quickly found out the camera isn't usable after dark--no matter how much you adjust the computer or the lighting in your setting. I've compared it to a very, very old Surface and a cheap tablet, along with 2 Lenovo's and it stands out in how TERRIBLE it is. Like humiliatingly bad with Zoom. Then after 12 months the touchscreen went out and when that was replaced the rest of the computer just had one problem after another. No facial recognition, freezes continually--literally a different problem each day. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER. I will never buy another Dell",0
Love the portability of this. Just getting used to the different processes from former computer.,0
"Bought this computer to do multimedia production on the road. As far as all the details of the computer, it is more than adequate... WHEN IT ISN'T CRASHING! It continually crashes. I was close to sending it in several times, but then in my efforts to try to find solutions, would think I had it fixed, then it would start crashing (Blue Screen). I missed the time to send it back to Amazon, so now I have to deal with it. I have researched about every website to see what is wrong. Would not recommend this computer at all!",0
It's fast and meets my needs. The sound quality is good. The size seems to be just right too. I would recommend this Chrome Book.,0
"Las especificaciones son muy buenas, lamentablemente venia muy mal configurada y he batallado demasiado con ello. Ya can 3 reinicios de fabrica y Asus no cubre esos problemas porque son de software, he tenido que buscar ayuda con un técnico para poder reparar todos los problemas que trae, lo único que falta es que pueda detectar la cámara ya que a veces funciona y la mayoría de las veces no funciona. Fuera de eso es excelente su rendimiento y al correr los juegos (después de arreglar muchos problemas).Soporte técnico de Asus hace responsable a Windows.",0
Corre todo lo que quiero jugar en ultra a 60 Fps sin problemas de temperatura o bajones de frames.,0
I dislike the fact that after the initial setup the unit only flashes the lights on the keyboard but never starts up,0
"The worst experience I have before with electronic devices, computer break down within the period of warranty, went to suggested spot, the technician saying have to break it down to fix but HP doesn't responsible at all. DONT PURCHASE THIS, go to grab a apple computer, definitely more expensive but worth more",0
"Barely works for having a few word documents open at once, constantly has issues where it shuts off and won’t turn back on, sometimes for days at a time. It seems like this laptop only works when it wants to, and even then you’d be lucky to get good use out of it. Even Minecraft lags on this thing.",0
"High quality for the price, easy to set up and use.",0
"The Laptop is very good and performs good at every level while gaming, But literally two weeks of purchasing the fans started making noise, I know that It makes noise because of the demand etc...But this noise is hardware issue the GPU fan started getting stuck on itself. Very unhappy",0
Used with cricket,0
Great laptop,0
"It's aesthetically pleasing and it's thin build and design reminds me of MacBook air. The system is rather fast and responsive and the display is awesome. I don't know why so many people are complaining about the screen. If you want higher quality, shell out the cash for a more expensive laptop. My only hangup with my Vivobook, is that the sound is a bit muffled if you're using it in bed. But I ordered a Bluetooth speaker which will remedy that. I would definitely reccomend this to a friend.",0
It works very well for my daughter taking college classes online.,0
This was a great purchase for my granddaughter she loves it. We have not found a negative side to the computer yet.,0
"This little computer Rocks!! Super fast and does everything I need it to do, and I have a job in the tech industry so, ya.",0
This computer is not worth the price it's lagy won't connect to wifi all in all I'm disappointed,0
Mostly games,0
"I've always wanted my own gaming laptop!! The real reason I bought this was for the art programs I use for school (Photoshop, Lightroom, and Corel Painter) and the programs run great!! For the gaming part, it runs really well especially on Minecraft and Don't Starve Together. Super satisfied with my purchase.",0
Horrible only works when it wants to camera and screen quality sucks i will return it,0
This is an amazing computer. mac books are overrated. This computer is sexy and works amazingly,0
"Great computer for price. Works nicely, can switch apps and surf fast and easy. Good storage, plays basic games and can stream easily. RAM is easily upgradeable, I would suggest upgrading to 8gb or higher RAM.",0
"La computadora cumple con los requisitos para un estudiante universitario, llego bien el producto muy protegido, es tal cual la descripción. Llego rápidoTotalmente recomendado",0
It good,0
"Charged this full before starting it up. From setting up windows and getting office installed it took 33 minutes and the battery went to 52%.I say screw this and send it back after talking to customer service. Being told it would be handled like a regular return.Returned on 9/01, tracking says Amazon received 9/08. Up through 9/18 ""Customer Service"" keeps copy and pasting ill get my FOUR FIGURE REFUND ""Once they receive it"". I point out the prior points and they say ""weeeellllllll... in some circumstances it may take longer email us if you haven't received a refund by OCTOBER SECOND!"" Thats right, 33 day refund in spite of what customer service said on day 1!Believe the battery life bad reviews on ASUS and question if you want to deal with refunds through the mail or at a brick and mortar. Especially if you buy Microsoft Office on 8/25 like I did!",0
This is all the PC I will ever need.,0
"Bought the 2022 model with 16 gigs. Play mostly league and older games to be honest, but I absolutely love the thing. It looks great- sleek but not obnoxiously gamer design. Web cam is pretty bad, but better then nothing- which is what most other gaming laptops in this price range will offer. Word of advice, avoid having the armory crate open while gaming, and make sure to let BIOS update to current before making a final judgement. I had performance issues prior to sorting out those two issues, but now it runs perfectly.",0
It stopped working within days of use. It just sat on my desk and it broke with only 2hrs of use,0
"I bought this computer about two months ago to use for writing, watching videos, and pretty basic internet browsing. Yesterday I get a low battery warning so I go to plug it in and when I come back it is off. Ok, I think, it died no big deal. Except it doesn’t turn back on. Then I realize it is not charging. An hour or so and some googling later, I have reset my battery and this time, it turns on. For about five seconds. I do the whole process again and let it sit plugged in overnight. Next mroning same thing, I get about five seconds and it shuts off.End result: I have ordered a new charger from HP, hoping that the off-brand one I got with my machine is the problem. It should arrive on monday but until then I have no computer.While I could use it it was a functional laptop. Nothing special but it did what I needed it to with pretty good speed. The keyboard is a little small but I’m down sizing from a 17”, so anything would feel small.This was a refurbished laptop. But there is NO reason for hardware to be giving out after only a few months.",0
It is perfect!,0
Paid $150 for it. It works well for watching Netflix and other internet stuff.,0
Muy Buen producto l,0
"it gets pretty noisy when the fan kicks in, but heat kills computers so you have to live with a certain amount of it.",0
budget option for gaming,0
"Very nice product, fast and sleek. I will say the battery life is pretty long. Havent tried to game yet but with the extra slots it comes with for ram and hard drive I'm sure itll do just fine. The boot up time is very fast, not loud. Keyboard buttons not the loud either, can use the product while sitting next to my sleeping baby. This is a real review..nice product thanks.",0
"love this one, quick and truly the most bang for your buck",0
"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well.",0
"Would like to instructions on how to use DVD. Great large screen. Good for movies, general social media and browsing.",0
The SSD portion of the computer allows instantaneous start and shut down to make a full restart occur in just seconds.,0
The lighting is customizable across the color spectrum and different colors can be assigned to each of the 4 zones the keyboard is divided into.,0
Pretty good for what it's worth. It will definitely substitute well until I have a better Desktop PC.,0
Bought the same model in local store this month.The updated CPU is a quad core compared with the previous dual-core i5. The boosted frequency is 3.4 GHz which is amazing!And the 12 GB ram is really really useful.Love it!,0
"Lenovo makes solid products at a fair price, this is no exception, i bought this for around 1k. It is fairly snappy, i find that lenovo usually has terrible screens but this one is acceptable. Mine is always plugged in but i heard battery life is terrible on this one. This is perfect for what i need and expected for a gaming laptop",0
I have onlly had this a month but I love it.. It is smooth and very fast and the screen is fantastic. I would tell anyone shopping for something like this to go for this one.. Priced right and has all the credentials of a great laptop.,0
The laptop does get a little hot,0
Por el precio y para el uso que se le piensa dar la verdad va muy bien,0
My step daughter loves it.,0
Ok,0
The laptop works great for my needs.,0
Audio is adequate and monitor resolution not that sharp,0
"This is a fast, well-optioned machine inside",0
"I've had this laptop for 5 months now. Great price (Bought it when it was $400). Battery will last all day. After about 6/7 hours-ish, I have 40ish% (""-ish"" cuz I haven't cared to take notes). Boots up quickly thanks to that good, good SSD. IMO the only con is the size of the SSD, but that's easily managed. I have a few hard drives from other computers that I turned into external drives. I mostly use it for doing web development and podcast editing.",0
the fingerprint reader stops working,0
"This was to augment / replace our family Chromebook (another Acer), which had three years' intensive use (~6 hours/day) before starting to go wonky. It's exactly what you expect - a slow-ish Chromebook with a decent screen, and a great value. Absolutely would recommend if you're just browsing or doing light office work on it.",0
"Sadly, this computer has stopped working. We have tried everything to fix the problem. Our warranty has expired. For something that costs as much as this computer did, and for what it was used for, it hasn't lasted long. Very disappointed with this product.",0
The computer is generally as advertised. Some of the keys do not work very well and the battery is terrible. This one will not hold an hour of use. I could understand half the life but 1/8th seems like they didn’t check it.,0
"I did a lot of research before I decided to purchase this laptop, and I'm so glad I chose this one. I chose to do the setup and it was so easy. It works great, as I'm using it for school and I'm a college student. The battery life is great. The laptop is able to handle having a lot of tabs opened which again I need since I'm a college student. Very happy with my purchase and I definitely recommend this laptop.",0
"This is an exceptional laptop. Aesthetically, it’s very pleasing. Resembles a MacBook Air. I opted for the 256SSD instead of the TBHDD+SSD combo and I was pleasantly surprised at its quickness. I also like the fact that the monitor bezel is as small as possible to accommodate the bigger screen. Keyboard and track pad are very nice. The fingerprint reader is a nice touch for the added security. Again, resembles the fingerprint reader on the iphones. I think Asus did a great job with this laptop. Would recommend. **** If there is anything I would say that’s negative, it would be that there is some greywsre added once you connect to WiFi such as gift box and a few other pieces. But that’s typical when you buy a laptop I guess.",0
"keys are ALL in small caps...hard as hell to see....their TECH support sucks....couldn't understand half of what they were saying....returned it two days after i got it...seem to make it ""copy and paste""",0
having the camera on the bottom of the screen - it looks into my stomach instead of my face.,0
"This laptop has S-Mode, essentially it will only download Microsoft apps.",0
"Pros1. Quality of materials-reminds me of the Macs I used for twenty years2. Speed3. Features I specifically wanted-backlit keyboard, hi-res screen,etc.Cons1.

all the bloatware installed which took me a month to work through and remove,0
"Aproveche en su momento la promoción. Es una laptop muy ligera y rápida, nunca he tenido problemas ya llevo 2 meses xon ella y super bien, solo es acostumbrándose al teclado en inglés que lo puedes configurar y listo. Es una maquina ideal para alguien que hace trabajos mediano, sin tantos programas a instalar para que tengas una experiencia magnífica. Su batería lo único que no dura cuando mucho 5 hrs, yo estuve usando con zoom unos quince días y si me llegaba a durar solo 4 hrs y mi curso duraba 8 hrs diarias.",0
"If you’re just looking for a simple laptop to send emails, go on social media, watch YouTube videos, etc. this one will do just that. Overall I don’t have any issues with it lagging. It’s easy to use and does what I need it to do. Good battery life. The screen is very clear and the sound is great too. I will say the keyboard letters did fade easily so I bought a cheap keyboard cover. I will also say the left click button is kind of loose and I’m not an aggressive clicker! For the most part I use the finger pad because it’s quicker when I’m browsing the web. So for the price I paid....I wouldn’t expect that to happen. The durability on that part could be better.",0
"The cloud-based infrastructure of this service is fantastic, effortlessly scaling workloads to meet the demanding needs of the customers.",1
so far so good computer works great still putting it through its paces,0
"Every time Windows 10 automatically upgrades, this notebook crashes and I have to reinstall Windows 10. But with the most recent Windows upgrade crash, I can't even sign in to the Welcome Screen so I can't do a recovery. This computer is 4 months old and still under warranty, but HP support it horrible. They keep promising to send me a link for a Recovery Kit I can download onto a flash drive, but the link never gets sent. I now have SEVEN case numbers in two days and still no link.. This is the worst computer purchase we have ever made and a complete waste of money.",0
Daughter seems to think it is fine.,0
"I bought this to replace my 5 years Dell gaming laptop. Good price, high performance.",0
Did not even have enough storage to upgrade windows. old version of windows. does not keep wifi connected.,0
After about 1 week I have constant blue screens with an error about power management drivers.I updated the BIOS and even performed a completely fresh install of windows and all the drivers with no luck. It will not wake from sleep and the TouchPad randomly stops working.Complete waste of time and money,0
"So far, great computer for what I need. I use it for personal business only.",0
"When I game and the GPU is in fact working hard, the laptop gets VERY hot, as does the power brick. I don’t have a flir so I cannot check the actual temps but it is hot to the touch to the point I worry about the longevity of the components inside.",0

Doesn't come with Windows 10 64bit cd key.,0
"I really liked a lot about this laptop but the deal breaker for me is the keyboard, it is awesome in terms of feel don't get me wrong, but for some stupid reason Asus decided to put a raised circular dot on the 'W' key. Every time I play a 'WASD' game I can feel the raised dot and it is very annoying and uncomfortable. It feels like the key cap is dirty...I looked into it and it seems like all the ROG laptops have this raised bump on the 'W' key.Anyways here's the lowdown (with all latest updates installed as of May 9th 2021):Pros: Great build quality, awesome RGB brightness and customization, speakers are really good for a laptop, very fast and performs great, great price for the performance and features, normal usage battery life is acceptable, great amount of IO ports, USB-C PD is great to have...Cons: Keystone is a gimmick, keyboard 'W' key has a raised circular nub, FHD screen text is blurry or has weird aliasing at 100% scaling in windows, cooling is not as good as expected, Armoury Crate software is buggy and does not launch sometimes which causes the shortcut buttons above the keyboard to not respond, RGB ocassionally bugs out and doesn't load presetAsus please offer smooth 'W' keycap, QHD config and remove the keystone and replace with the fingerprint power button from the Zephyrus line...",0
It keeps blinking,0
only real problem is the fans are loud but hasnt really bothered me. otherwise its a great laptop.,0
Very good laptop for gaming and streaming(fortnite/r6 siege with streaming software running at the same time) but like every other gaming laptops it gets HOT that's my only complaint(I know that they're all like that but it would be fun not to have to repaste the damn cpu when you get it!). Get a good cooling pad and try to undervolt cpu and other little tweeting and you ready to go(gpu overclock)!,0
"Got this laptop for my son's 9th birthday. He really wanted a laptop to play Minecraft with his friend, and thought it was a good opportunity for him to learn how to work a pc too (only been doing iPad so). Set up was fairly easy, comes with month of free Norton antivirus, after that need to pay or look for something else. It's like a regular Windows computer (we don't have that much knowledge about Windows or hardcore gaming), but works well with both PE and java Minecraft (although there was an incident where PE version got stuck at the red open screen. had to look online to figure out the fix. adjusted the screen frame rate or something and got fixed i think). He also plays Roblox, and is starting to explore other games with it.Love how the laptop it self looks though. The design is cool, and seems like a fashionable design for gamers. Love the red lit keyboards (at first I was hoping it'd be a different color, but not bad).Battery life doesn't seem to hold that much, but we keep it plugged in most of the time. Screen quality can be better compared to other pcs, but is good enough.",0
Amazing gaming laptop for an average price honestly,0
"I'm going to college and I didn't want anything fancy. I wanted something cheap and that function well. I can research, write essays, watch YouTube/Netflix. Not a lot of storage and not great to play videogames. Definitely worth the price.",0
Just used in class room. Unit worked flawlessly. Excellent unit for taking notes.,0
I bought two of these for my daughters for Christmas. They both love them and do everything that they need. Fast shipping and very good price. Very satisfied.,0
"We didn't notice that this has no Numeric keys on the right. Therefore, good for my husband...bad for me in my work. I'll have to buy my own laptop.",0
It is well built and really a great laptop for the price,0
"Though the machine ran smooth and fast, being a renewed item from Amazon the screen arrived damaged limiting visibility in the upper screen by hiding browser tabs.",0
I am very satisfied with this lap top,0
"Great vendor, terrible laptop. What good is all that CPU and RAM if the hard drive is so slow? It was intolerable - i returned it. I think this would be a great laptop if you wanted to sink another couple hundred for a SSD and void the warranty but I didn’t. Found one with same specs and SSD online elsewhere for just a little more.",0
"This thing is basically a powerful PC that costs $192. I personally bought it to listen to Pandora and I can do so without using an AP because those are very unreliable. Since it is a PC with Google I just use chrome to log me in automatically to Pandora with no AP_Style problems (signal dropping). the almost full size key board, compact size and powerful modum are also a big plus. Highly recommended.",0
Zenbook 14 has a very good sound system.,0
"Muy recomendable, no estoy muy acostumbrado a las laptops gamers, y buscaba una con esas prestaciones pero sin la exageración de las mismas. Esta es la mejor actualmente en el mercado. Por ahora a una semana de uso es la mejor decisión que pude tomar, espectacular por la calidad-precio.",0
As much as I enjoy my new MacBook. It is way too soon to be experiencing loading delays. I barely have anything loaded on the computer and I have experienced several delays.,0

"Love it, perfect size for sitting in the recliner! Great bang for the buck.",0
"This one is a good size, well placed with good buttons.",0
Very fast!,0
I have had this laptop for a month now and I'm absolutely enjoying the performance this beast laptop has to offer. This laptop has an RTX 3070 low wattage GPU and is more powerful than the RTX 3060 laptop in terms of cooling and performance. The laptop is very light but the only downside I ever felt with this laptop is its battery life. I hardly get around 4 hours in super battery saver mode. Other than that this is a great laptop and will suggest everyone to just go for it without any hesitation.,0
Works great for what I need. Transfers photos fast. Quick start up.,0
"First of all, an error in the above description. Hard drive interface is NVMe (with a 2242 SSD installed), not Serial ATA. There is an extra slot for a 2.5"" SATA drive, but it has a dummy in the slot when it arrives. It also comes with 1x8GB DDR4 RAM slot populated.That being said, I added a second 8GB of RAM (which gives at least a 10% performance boost), loaded it up and was good to go. I had a spare 128 GB 2.5"" SSD that I put in as well for additional storage, though I won't need it any time soon. This thing is a lot faster than I expected. No bloatware (other than McAfee). Lenovo Vantage updates your drivers automatically. It has Windows 10 Pro 1903 preinstalled, and Windows 10 updates took care of the rest. I was off and running within 15 minutes with all my software installed. (Of course, I'm a PC tech with a high speed internet connection, so for some it may take longer.)This is larger than I expected, but I was used to carrying around a 13.3"" laptop. But that is my fault, not Lenovo's. This thing is about as small as a multipurpose 15"" laptop can get. And the screen is fantastic (HD resolution, matte finish, no glare, wide viewing angles).Keyboard is what you expect from a Thinkpad, of good quality, and not overly mushy or resistant.With my standard workload, so far I get 7-7.5 hours of battery life. Most of my work is not processor heavy, and consists mostly remotely fixing, or writing up service details while onsite with a client.Overall, a really nice laptop. Highly recommended.",0
"I was looking for something ultra portable for Browsing, ebook reading, and general use..Just as described.I added a 128Gb microSD card (mounted) on C drive for permanent storage...Switched off Win 10 s > win 10 home..Had to update before I was able to switch off S mode..Loving it so far!..Thanks Amazon for fast service as always..",0

"This has basically replaced my work laptop. I open this and it's ready to roll where my work laptop takes anywhere from 1-3 minutes to get going--Windoze. There are very few things that I cannot accomplish on this Chromebook, and I have found some work arounds or solutions to most of my challenges. Easy to set up and use, I'd recommend this to anyone who is tired of waiting for their computer to update all the time.",0
Screen appears very dim after a while,0
"el pedido es todo lo que aparece en la descripción, recomendado.el envío demora, pero es por temas de transporte en chile, el vendedor envía el producto rapidamente.",0
Nice laptop. Runs well after the updates. My only complaint is the win updates took over four hours. That's with a good internet connection.,0
Very good machine!,0
"This is an OP laptop, excellent for gaming almost any new game, playing fps games is really smooth with that 300hz screen, when working at top speed fans there are not as loud as I expected and you can easily control every aspect of performance, the mux switch is an excellent addition, the only con is that doesn't come with a camera but overall its a must have laptop if you are looking for better performance, with that 12gen Intel chip things fly!",0
"Good price, purchased just to be backup computer in case of trouble with primary computer.",0
"The loud fans can be a little annoying. I play the sims 4 with a good bit of cc and mods and it definitely heats up and has a lot of fan noise. Also it’s pretty heavy but overall it plays fine with high graphics otherwise, lower graphics might help the noise and heat.",0
"First off, presentation is key. The plastic feels amazing to the touch and definitely seem like they'll hold up during the lifespan of this beefy laptop. I was looking for something to not only outperform my old HP, but hopefully outlive it as well. Now I'm certain user error was to blame in shortening the lifespan of my previous laptop (such as leaving it in a hot car this drying out the thermal paste) but it's build wasn't all too phenomenal to begin with. It wasn't exactly built with upgradability or durability in mind and had a pretty lackluster cooling solution for a machine with an AMD chip (nothing wrong with team red or team blue, they just happen to have different draw backs and thermal efficiency has been an issue with AMD from what I've heard).The Asus TUF F17 is built to a military spec and has a bottom panel designed to give easy access to upgrade slots (a second M.2 and dual channel RAM) and also reveals the dual fan, heat piped the heck out thermal solution that will ultimately serve as the back bone of this glorious machine when it comes to preventing its premature death. (That and hopefully a lack of user error like leaving it in a hot car or using it on my bed...)As for actually usage, I haven't gotten around to it just yet but I can certainly note the quality of the keyboard. The clicks feel solid and don't feel gooey like the sensation some cheap switches provide. The travel distance is quite nice as well. Many laptops have too short a travel distance for my taste but I feel this simulates a desktop keyboard quite nicely. The mouse pad isn't oversized, as I'm sure you saw in the photos, but I would argue that the size is perfect for average usage and it definitely isn't undersized. The plastic on the surface of the touchpad feels very quality as well. There's no give underneath and it has a soft feel that I'll never get tired of.On a final note, I can say the screen is of high quality as well with little signs of backlight seepage from the edges. No dead pixels, excellent color for the frequent movie watcher, and a nice smoothness generated by the 144Hz refresh rate. Also, the screen half isn't very flimsy either. Quite the opposite. You could surely open and close this thing a thousand times in one sitting without a single issue. However, I think the standard 1920 by 1080 resolution is a bit sub par - just a hot take. I'm also spoiled by the desktop setup which features a 120Hz with a 4k resolution so do keep my bias in mind. Actually, after using the laptop for a bit I'm quite used to it and the screen actually looks fairly sharp. So go Asus! (Maybe I shouldn't put my face so close to the screen all the time...)I may post updates about actual hardware performance at a later date. Just note for now that if it's build quality your after this is the laptop for you. I purchased this one at a bargain price of around $650 for the holidays so my review does have some bias from that. (MSRP was about $850 at time of purchase but is now listed at around $899)I have had time to test the camera and yeah.... I will never understand why laptop cameras are so horrible. But the microphone is nice! Even dual channel! That's another selling point as far as I'm concerned!",0
Quality of item was state-of-the-art. Delivery was exceptional. Elegant packaging. Seller is first-rate and choice.,0
I just opened it and found the damage done to corners of this laptop. Poor quality management.,0
"AMAZING PRODUCT, I've had this laptop for a year on Black Friday. The price for the laptop is still the same like last year. This laptop is definitely worth the money and is the best laptop on the market.",0
the USB's weren't in a very intuitive position,0
I got this for school after my hp computer's battery stopped working. It's really great for the price! the screen resolution is really nice and the touch id is a good add on. I really wish apple would make touch screen macbooks but they probably never will. it also doesn't have a usb port which is kind of weird. learning the controls takes some time but overall a great computer!,0
"Great specs - just what I was looking for. Many connection options including TB3, powerful graphics for non-gaming applications, primarily a desktop replacement that is also very mobile if necessary. Everything works as expected.

I love it it woks perfectly,0
"I run Elementary OS (a un Ubuntu Linux-based distro). It works pretty well, although from time to time, I have some issues and the computer becomes almost (but not totally) frozen and I've to hard-reset it. I blame ElementaryOS/Ubuntu/Linux about this. The laptop itself is beautiful.",0
"I purchased this to replace a 9 year old laptop. I had it less than a week when I noticed the back getting hot. Really hot. We used a forehead thermometer to read how hot it was & the thermometer could not read it because it was too high. I could not keep my hand on the back of the computer because it was too hot. It took more than 2.5 hours for the temperature to drop.Thankfully, the Amazon Customer Service team was AMAZING. I spoke to a representative & a replacement was ordered in less than 20 minutes. They also sent clear instructions for returning the laptop.I am hoping that this is just a one off issue & it doesn't repeat. I will come back with an update.",0
Great customer service The guy helped me to decide which other chuwi product can I get for me,0
"Almost everything is perfect about this laptop, however, one of my extra bass sony earpods produces continuous white noise when plugged into this computer, another earpods had the same problem but the volume is much lower, apple's earpods doesn't have this issue. I guess there's some low frequency bug in this computer which seems to be a common issue of the xps13. The speakers are fine.",0
"Run, don’t walk, away from this product. Computer price and description said “New” yet we received a very used, very damaged computer. Scratched, banged up, and the metal over the power port was bent. Immediately returned and 2 weeks later have not received a refund or even been told if they’ve received the computer.",0
Unhappy that it had error messages when starting and then connectivity problems after that. Came without a Windows 11 CD so I can't fix driver issues,0
Delivered as advertised. I got this for my dad and now he won't stay off of it. It's screaming fast has a very solid construction.,0
"[Update 12/20/2018] I worked with Dell on this issue and finally had to send the computer back to Dell for service. They replaced the main board and the computer seems to be working fine. Credit here to Dell for standing behind their product.But going through the diagnosis and repair is a pain. The technical support people wanted to eliminate all the software possibilities so we kept trying things including a clean re-install of Windows - which wiped my machine.After we eliminated all the software possibilities, Dell sent me a box and I shipped it back to them on a Tuesday. I received the unit back on the following Wednesday.But this is all things that shouldn't have happened. The computer should have operated properly when I received it. Perhaps it was defective and was not refurbished properly. It would have been worth a few extra dollars to avoid all of this service headache.Note that this is not a ding on Dell but on the company who claimed to refurbish the computer. Dell stepped up and fixed the unit.+++++++++++++++++++[Update] I'm experiencing a problem with this computer in that it gives a Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD) occasionally. It recovers from the BSOD and goes back to normal operation. I'm working with Dell now to find a solution. They believe it's a software problem but if that were correct, it seems that everyone would be having the BSOD problem. I'll post a follow-up after I work with Dell some more. Really disappointing. I've never had a computer that was this unreliable.++++++++++++++I've only had the computer for a couple of days - it's a refurb unit. The computer was clean and unmarked - looked like new. Setup was normal and the unit functions like I'd expect a new computer to function.It was packed well and was shipped quickly. Not much else to say - I'll have to wait until I have more time with it to see if any problems crop up. I thought the price was fair considering it has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. I'll probably have to upgrade it to a 1TB SSD at some point in the future - I checked the maintenance manual and an upgrade looks pretty easy.",0

"Slower than slow. Confirmed the specs, but just not even remotely up to snuff. 2 stars for looks!",0
This laptop is lightweight and easy to take on the go. I needed a new laptop for work and this one is perfect. It's affordable and surprisingly good. I've never had a Chromebook but I kinda like it. What I don't like is they keyboard. It's smaller and more condensed than others which makes it a little harder to type on. Not everything is at the same place as I'm used to. There's big speakers on either side of the keyboard that could have been put somewhere else to make room for the keys. But that's my only qualm. I would recommend this laptop.,0
Excellent for student life. I'm a college student and this little thing does everything I need it to do. It's simple to use and is quickly responsive.,0
Computer is great for my 12yr son battery life is amazing!!!,0
All I have to share is that hinge broke after 6 months of use. Didn't save the box it came with and i cant find no serial number in The notebook. Without it asus says cant do anything to help me. Sad.,0

"Two weeks after I received the Chromebook, the charger stopped working. I had to contact Samsung & they replaced it. Now, 2 months later it keeps dropping the internet connection. This Chromebook is a piece of junk and no one wants to stand behind it. Never again.",0
"This is a great laptop for the value. The RTX 2070 inside packs a massive punch, the display at 144hz refresh rate is beautiful to look at, and the processor keep everything running smoothly. For the price you are getting this laptop at, it is hard to pass up. A must purchase for someone looking for a mid price laptop that runs at upper-mid to low-high end gaming. I have been able to run every game at max graphics (DOOM Eternal, Fallen Order, etc) with 144fps or more. Amazing machine. Only cons are the battery life, which if you are using as a dedicated gaming machine should not be a problem if you stay plugged in, and the speakers can sound a bit tinny at times, but if you use headphones this should be no problem. A must buy for someone looking for a dedicated gaming laptop.",0
"So far, this laptop has been able to run everything I've thrown at it. I mainly got it for FF14, which it can run on max setting at a smooth 120-144 FPS, even in the more intense areas with lots of people. It's also very quick and has tools built in to customize your experience based on the type of game or application you are running. I also love the backlight keyboard and you can change the color of the keys as well as their color pattern. It's got everything you'd want in a gaming laptop, especially for the price.",0
"This is a very nice laptop and really delivers on the specs it promises.Performance-wise, the laptop is absolutely solid. Its RAM is great for most audio mixing and video animation and manipulation I've tried so far. My only dislike is how quickly the laptop heats up, which subsequently triggers the fans, which can be admittedly loud. This isn't really a surprise as the trade-off is entirely expected for such high performance especially with the GPU. The MSI Gaming Center app is very well designed in that it helps you optimize the performance as you need, also helping you keep an eye on CPU/GPU temperatures and overall system health.The screen quality is pretty good as well. Although, the chassis is a bit flimsy, almost feeling like I'm going to bend the screen everyone I open the laptop, but at a $1400 price tag it's decent when you factor in the performance aspects. I haven't used this laptop for much gaming, mostly content creation, but it provides some solid graphics resolution for animation.Battery life is surprisingly higher than you might expect from a gaming laptop, but it's still fairly quick to run out and may incur performance issues when unplugged. I can usually get about 2 hours of casual browsing with maybe some YouTube when unplugged, but I can definitely notice some performance lags in those cases.Overall, for the price and performance, this is a great deal and great product. As with anything, there's things you can nitpick, but most of these aren't dealbreakers for me. I'm very happy with the performance I get out if this laptop!",0
"Although I'm not an expert and I have to say I haven't bought a new laptop in a while, this is by far my favorite laptop. Before, with my Acer Aspire E5-575 (intel core i3-7100) I could make probably fix me up a bowl a ramen before it finished booting up, and another bowl while my desktop apps start up too.Now it takes literal seconds, I can log in and open itunes in probably less than 30 seconds, I'm not even exaggerating, that's how fast it is! I feel like the battery isn't much of an upgrade, when I'm watching videos or playing games of course the battery drains faster, but I feel that for a newer laptop they could make a longer lasting battery. I guess it's a trade off between performance and battery life, but since I only need to fully charge it once a day when I'm using it all the time then it's already pretty good. (Maybe it's more of a quarantine problem since my laptop has become like a part of me now! I'm almost never away!)So far the only problems I've had is that it came with so much bloatware when it arrived, I had to uninstall A LOT of stuff after I first started using it. It also came with Microsoft Edge which is uninstallable, I'm not a fan of apps that you can't uninstall. Not the end of the world, but it did feel like an annoyance. I had to straight up look for it in the computer files and delete it that way because there was no way to uninstall it.Another thing is that the backlight for the keyboard always comes on after you shut it down or if it goes to sleep and you wake it. If you turn it off for one session then it doesn't save that setting. It's kind of annoying turning it off every time I turn it on, minor annoyance, but since I do use the backlight it isn't so bad for me.But seriously, for $599, this computer is totally worth it! I listed the cons because they were easy to think of, but if I were to list all the pros, this review would be too long! Luckily the specs are already available. Just go to noteb.com and add the Acer Nitro 5 to your comparison list against another laptop. The chances are you aren't going to get a much better laptop for a better price.",0
"I was a bit worried recieving a used laptop or something wrong with it but it came thru and its actually brand new!

"I have had my new MacAir not quite two weeks and it is even better than I expected. This one is with the new M1 chip and is an upgrade from my previous Mac....which I loved. Faster, better, more battery. What's not to like. And frankly the price for the machine is a bargain. I do not use my Mac for gaming, heavy downloads, large graphics so can't comment but is why the Air is a perfect choice over the Pro. Transferring files etc from my previous Mac was a snap and now I have my ""old"" Mac on the M1 so everything works better. I was a bit surprised everything is the same size and weight....but that's likely because I didn't look at those specs before purchase. One sweet thing about the Mac is it comes about 70% charged so just open and start. If you are considering a Mac or have one and are thinking about upgrade just do it. And Amazon made it easy....arrived in two days.",0

"I bought this laptop to replace my old Dell laptop. I have had the unit for a week now and here are my impressions thus far. I was impressed with the way the unit was packed; almost AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNIT ITSELF. It arrived in pristine condition with nary a blemish anywhere. The initial setup took a bit more than 5 minutes, and went through with no problems. The keyboard felt good but a few key positions were weird. The screen was gorgeous with no bleed at all. These facts are really not that important to me as I use it hooked up to externals, but I can tell you the picture is breath taking on a 50"" HD panel.A day later there was an issue and the unit started having difficulty. Thankfully I had made recovery media and so was able to reinstall the OS. Approximately 7 hours later all updates were again done, and all my programs loaded. The only issue left was Armoury crate no longer worked. I called Asus support and within 5 minutes was speaking to a rep who was able to get my issue fixed within an hour.Now for the important stuff. This thing is a beast. I have run bench marks on it and it ran in the 90th percentile. All games run smoothly at their highest video levels. With some of the better done 3d games it is hard to tell if you are watching a movie with live people or a game. I did purchase a cooler pad with the unit and have not seen the temp go over 58 C yet. The only changes I made to the unit was I did up the memory to 32 gig as the unit only came with 16gb on a single chip. I also added an external 1TB SSD as it only had a 256 GB on board.Over all I found the laptop to be attractive without being too gamish. It has a solid well built feel to it; though it is a bit on the heavy side. Over all I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone that is looking for performance on a budget.",0
I did not know a laptop could be so bad. Everything loads up slow. Very laggy. Can run barely anything,0
"We did have to return one of these and they were out by then and change to another brand because the second one we bought didn't turn on. So, we bought another that worked just fine.

"Screen quality is good and also the touch works well. So far, so good. I've been using it every day for work. All I need now, is the HP pen.",0
"Acer Chromebook is beautiful to the touch. Performance is amazing, graphics and memory in abundance. Very happy with this purchase on behalf of my daughter for school!",0
"I've owned a few Acer's in my life, my previous laptop was a different brand but the one before that was also an Acer so I decided to go back to it when I needed an upgrade. This is such a solid laptop. Boots up quickly and easily. It's relatively lightweight and the screen looks great. I honestly don't have any complaints. I was able to install Chrome and the other programs I like very easily and it was working for me instantly once I plugged it in. This is not a power horse machine, but for regular non-gaming computer work, it's pretty perfect. We use this one for the kids homework, emails and just general home use, and it's exactly what we need. The price is great too so we don't worry about the younger kids using it because it's not a huge investment.",0
the fans are quite noticeable when it's not idling.,0
I did not know that this was a second-hand laptop.,0
"Extremely happy with this product. I think the screen is beautiful! Nowhere near as bad as people are saying. They're probably used to super high end machines. I'm not, so it's an upgrade in my book. Super clear and just bright enough. The viewing angles are not an issue.I was having issues updating the graphics card driver and had to system restore, but it worked perfectly the second time around. My advice is not to set it up until you are connected to the internet as it does install critical updates immediately. Also, wait until everything is completely setup and updated before u begin deleting bloatware. Speaking of, do not delete ASUS Splendid utility!! I did and the screen instantly got washed out. I reinstalled it but it doesn't do anything now. I've played with the color settings in the Intel graphics card but it's not as beautiful as it was with the Splendid utility. Just a little warning.ALSO, I was expecting a slightly rose-goldish color based on the photos, but it's actually more of a medium silver with a slight brown/warm tint. Still a beautiful color, just not what I was expecting.It's snappy and can handle just about anything. Love it.EDIT: One star taken off because it runs quite hot. Unnecessarily. I'm talking CPU and motherboard temperatures are getting to 95 Celsius. I play Guild Wars 2 on high settings and it handles it beautifully, but the hear it generates concerns me. I know it's a laptop but that's still quite hot.EDIT: After some research, I decided to throttle the CPU down to just 98% on balanced mode and it COMPLETELY erased my temperature issues. The highest I reach now is 75c and that's when gaming (Guild Wars 2 super high settings) in open world mass PvP!!! Which is actually quite amazing. The i7's are known to run hot. And the sound is amazing!!! For a laptop this thing really packs a punch. Be sure to play around with the preinstalled ASUS SonicMaster tools. They make a huge difference in tonality.Taking rating back to 5 stars.Hope this helps someone!",0
"I 'inherited' a Dell laptop but had four issues with it: 1) it was too heavy for me, 2) it didn't come with Microsoft Word 3) it was slow as molasses, and 4) it would not allow me to install Google Docs for some reason.What I wanted: something lightweight and portable that I could use to write (I write series novels and how-to manuals), browse online and occasionally watch Youtube videos.After doing research on many models, I landed on this Samsung Chromebook. It really is fantastic for my needs! Set-up was a breeze, all I had to do was enter my Gmail address and it was up & running! It is super lightweight so it rests comfortably on my lap or I can just toss it in a larger handbag to take it elsewhere. The size is comfortable for me, too. I'm petite and I really appreciate having something that's not so 'spread-out.' I do have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 which is 10 inches and this is only slightly bigger than it. And my absolute favorite feature is that I don't need Wifi or an internet connection to write offline using Google Drive. That's huge! I do run it off my home's Wifi, but sometimes I'll bring it to work (where the Wifi password has yet to be cracked by anyone) and I can still write during downtime.Techy stuff: it does updates automatically and it is safe & secure. Not sure about the technical terms for that but I feel comfortable using this without the worry that my personal files will be stolen or visible to anyone.",0
"Love my new Mac ! It’s very light, battery lasts a long time. Days even - with light use. Charges quickly too. I haven’t bought a case yet - it’s too gorgeous to cover up! But will buy a sleeve for transporting when I travel. No complaints. LOVE IT.",0
Very fast but low quality sound,0
"This Chromebook has no delete key.How in the world can a computer have no delete key?It will not allow for any widgits to show on the screen, and any bookmarked items only show on the top bar.How to delete them? Who knows, since there is no delete key!Maybe, just maybe I missed something.But the ""manual"" is just a few pages long and tells you absolutely nothing.The tutorial is worse.I'd return it, but now I can't DELETE any of my info.Target practice tomorrow.",0
"This Mac has the best storage, sowed, and battery life! It works amazing for what I use it for!",0
"Very dissatisfied with the computer; only had it for 3months and have been having nonstop issues: frozen screen and buttons not working to close programs, open screen or use the functions. Very quirky.",0
"Love this chrome book - perfect for everyday stuff like browsing web and general home computing activities. My first chrome book and can’t believe I never had one before, like much better than my laptop, and fraction of the cost.",0
Ideal replacement for my Windows 10 PC. No more fooling with windows problems.,0
"Best laptop I have had, the i7 10th gen preforms well under heavy load (I'm a software developer) and the graphics are top of the line. I like the anti reflective screen and light up keyboard as well. A little loud, but that is expected to cool down the internals with the open mesh bottom. Overall it's a great laptop and I think it future proofs me for while.",0
"I absolutely love this laptop. I was definitely overdue for a new laptop but was holding off because-who wants to purchase a new laptop? I upgraded from the Macbook Pro I believe the 2017 version and that one was definitely running really slow. I run a decent amount of programs on the computer including video editing software and the new MacBook Air can handle it just fine. The screen is so large I absolutely love it. There is no more wasted space at the menu bar at the top of the page which creates so much more space. Also, the keys on the keyboard seem to be spaced out a bit more so typing is much easier than on my iPad keyboard or even the older MacBook pro keyboard. I am very happy with the purchase. I purchased the skylight option which is outside of my comfort level as I would normally go with a space grey color but I am really happy with the choice. The laptop is light enough to be portable but also sturdy enough for me to put it into my bag and me feel confident that it will be safe.",0
"Quick start up and fingerprint sensor is arguably more reliable than that of a cellular device. Screen is not as bright as a more expensive laptop but is bright enough to still find myself squinting when I open it at night. Smooth running, decent battery, overall a VERY good budget laptop!!",0
It blacked out after some months. But it was a very great machine. I will buy a motherboard to replace,0
Works perfectly for my needs.,0
"This computer lived up to and surpassed my highest expectations. I could not recommend it more. The battery life is surreal. The screen is gorgeous. It is snappy, fast, and outperforms my much more expensive previous gen Macs. Such an incredible feat of engineering.",0
Great cheap tool for web development (using Linux) and everyday Internet usage. Every additional feature would be unnecessary for my personal usage.,0
"the powers that be decided to stop supporting this laptop. i don't care, i'm still using it. i lost a lot of pictures when they took the cloud away, but i couldn't figure how to access the cloud anyway. i've had this since 2018, and i still pay bills, email, shop and search the web on it. i've had to buy 2 replacement charger cords because they frayed, but the unit itself is a tank.",0
So far it's been great I haven't had any problems with it I know I have seen some bad reviews on it so I guess I will update this if I have any The only thing that wasn't great was the battery life that is why I gave it 4 stars,0
The only major issue that I keep on having is that I will be trying to open a Zoom meeting and it goes to my home screen and closes all windows. Other than that I'm really liking my computer.,0
fast to boot up. fast with multiple windows open. wonderful screen with sharp resolution. great sound bar speakers with one button to push to raise/lower/mute volume (most other brands you have to push two buttons at once - Fn + another button. A great price for a great laptop. I would highly recommend this product.,0
"I've owned this laptop for about a month now and I must say that I am really enjoying it so far. After a lot of deliberation and a lot of reading conflicting reviews, I decided to give this laptop a shot because my other computer is an ASUS ROG laptop that is still going strong seven years after its purchase.As a student, I need a laptop that is very portable and capable of doing a variety of work. I primarily use this computer for coding in Visual Studio and other platforms such as Unity. I am a game design and development major, so I spend a lot of time coding games and working on web development.The first thing about this laptop that I noticed out of the box is how lightweight it is. I can easily pick up up with a single hand and carry it in my backpack without even noticing it's in there. In addition, the size feels just right for me. The screen is easy to see and the keyboard feels nice to use. It fits my hands pretty well and none of the keys feel our of reach nor do they feel cramped together. I also like how the touch pad works, which is a must for somebody who doesn't want to carry around a mouse.Some people have complained about battery life, and I have noticed that I can work for several hours without needing to be plugged in. If you are playing games or watching a lot of videos on this machine, you will probably burn the battery quickly, but I've gone days without charging it- but I usually only use it in short spurts.People have also complained about low memory, but once again I haven't had a single issue here. I think some people expect, as my mom would say, a machine that can fly you to the moon and back without paying for a rocket-ship. It's a silly saying I know, but it's definitely a common attitude.My only complains about this computer are very minor. Other people mentioned the screen is a bit wobbly when you unfold it, and I've noticed that if you or something else bumps into the desk or table the computer is on, the screen wobbles pretty violently. I'm not a computer expert and couldn't tell you if this is an actual issue or not. I've learned through experience working with electronics that buyers often expect a products weight and sturdiness to be an indication of its value, when in reality most products simply add weights to the inside of a product to make it seem better without actually adding anything useful to the design, so maybe screen wobble isn't a huge deal- I'm not an expert.So in conclusion, if you need something fast, reliable, and portable that you need for working on moderately-demanding projects, this is your laptop. Don't expect to go gaming on it or binging Netflix for hours on end without plugging it in, but it can handle a lot of tasks very easily.If anything changes over time, I'll be sure to come back and edit this review.",0
"As a chromebook it is absolutely worth every penny. After an update of the OS (check for updates before you setup everything as the update deletes all the settings you have made) one can also install Android apps. However..... here comes the crux, ONLY from Google Play store!!! If you want to install Android apps from other locations or business apps, the device needs to be put into developer mode. For the tech savvy this is not that difficult, but has a number of drawbacks when placed in developer mode; 1) Every time the device boots, there is a large warning screen that the device is in developer mode and thus not secure. This screen incurs 30 second delay. 2) The device is no longer in secure mode. 3) If you do switch it back to secure mode, it ""power washes"" (factory reset) everything.However, I did read some rumors recently that Google considers to come with an update that would allow Android apps to be installed from non-Google-Play stores without developer mode.",0
Very nice laptop!,0
"As someone who is 20 years old, the second half of my public school computing was done largely on Chromebooks. From 8th grade to Senior Year, Chromebooks were part of my daily life. Now that I'm going into tech school, I figured I'd stick to the same simple to use laptops. My main desktop at home runs Linux, where I do all my ""real"" computer things, and my Android phone is my ultra portable computer. So I wanted an in between device, and Chromebooks are perfect for that. This one has a sleek, no frills design which I love. Very Lenovo. The screen is in line with what I'm used to seeing on a chromebook. Battery life is amazing, and the usb c charger is absolutely wonderful, as I can also charge my phone with the same cable. The cable also charged my Switch! Keyboard feels great, but I wish it had a back light. Speakers are good, on par with most chromebooks, but I mainly use bluetooth headphones. Also, Linux app support is absolutely great for me, being able to use the same apps I run on my desktop, if needed.",0
The Chrome Book stopped working within 3 days of having it....,0
"Pues con el producto todo bien, la Laptopo llegó correctamente empacada y es justo lo que viene en la publicación. Sin embargo he enviado mensajes en reiteradas ocasiones para que me realicen una factura y no he tenido respuesta. Sigo insistiendo esperando obtenerla pronto.",0
"I'm not sure about the gaming aspect of this lap top and personally, I don't care. I bought this lap top for the purpose of running programs like Solid Works or Fusion 360 for drawing and designing parts for machining purposes. This lap top does exactly that. This lap top is exceptionally fast and does exactly what I need it to do. I do not game at all. My only complaint is the batter life. The battery life sucks ass. Within about 2 hours the battery is at 40-50%. For me that's not that big of a deal as I always have my power supply with me. I just feel this battery life should be a lot more efficient than what it is. Otherwise, I love this lap top for what I use it for. Memory is great and the processor speed is exceptional.",0
Easy to carry around,0
"I bought this laptop to use with dual monitors set up through USB Type-C port. This computer is limited to data transfer only through the Type-C port. If I would have known that, I would have bought a Dell again.",0
Need to return it does not work correctly,0
Pour le travail excelent,0
Will not accept Windows or any other software.,0
I got it for internet browsing and internet browsing alone. Battery life is great. Screen size is great. Price is great.Would recommend 100%.,0
"It worked great for the first four days, then shut down and did not turn back on.",0
buena calidad y precio,0
"I love this laptop! Works great and inexpensive. I’ve had it now for almost two years and it’s still running as if I just got it. The only complaint I have is the sound, it’s very low even at 100%. Still worth it! I’ve bought other brands in the passed and always had issues with them, they never lasted long at all. My next laptop will definitely be this brand.",0
"Amazing quality from Apple. I was very sad to see some macbook airs go stray the past few years. Apple finally came back to its roots and built this masterpiece of a laptop. I have been a windows and mac user over the years, mostly being on windows. But the m1 has made it possible for me to make a complete transition. After going through laptops year after year, breaking down, and becoming outdated. I feel confident with m1 as my daily driver and I can run windows on it. Absolutely amazing. No reason to buy any other laptop right now.",0
"We bought our girls this computer for Christmas, they love them. This is a great deal considering my Apple was 10x this price! They are a bit heavy, but for school, and tasks that children and adults need, perfect. I will update if needed.",0
Incredibly good laptop for its price,0
"Bought this for school. Dead on arrival. Got a replacement model shipped overnight and works fine. The price may be enticing, but be wary of possible issues.",0
It is surprisingly small and light which are great qualities while still maintaining the feeling of a durable and structured laptop,0
"Es muy buena opción por el tipo de procesador, los materiales no son premium pero cumplen, la laptop en color azul resulta un poco más oscuro en la vida real, pero se sigue viendo muy bonita. Me gustó mucho el producto. Llevo 2 semanas utilizando la y todo funciona correctamente. Yo la compré en $7,900.°° pero he visto bajar su precio a menos de $ 7,600.°°. Recomiendo esperar un precio así para adquirirla y valdrá aún más la pena.",0
Per key RGB is beautiful and stunning. Pressing the Fn key lights up the available Fn key is cool.,0
It works amazingly. I have never had games download so fast.,0
muy buena maquina,0
The Laptop I bought is marvelous!,0
"Telecom networking lab junkie here. My daily driver is a MacBook Pro and happen to come across a situation where I had to quickly acquire a ChromeBook for an urgent customer project. Really didn’t think much of ChromeOS until now. Anyway, I had to get a Chromebook and figure out how to port over my companies test software to enable customers to test WiFi networks by running several L4-7 application sessions over WiFi to gauge application performance. Anyway, using the Chromebook I managed to find out a workaround to install my companies Linux based app onto ChromeOS so that project was a success. 1 check for ChromeOS for being Linux based and the ability to run several apps in a docker environment.So one day I decided to see if I can conduct my day to day tasks with this low priced, skimmed down laptop. Enabled GooglePlay so I can run Android apps on ChromeOS. 2 checks for ChromeOS so far.Enabled developer mode so I can easily access the Linux back end to do the nerdy command line stuff via the chrome based Linux terminal (crosh). Check number 3 for ChromeOS.Installed ChromeBrew (crew) in ChromeOS to enable the ability to download Linux based apps and install onto ChromeOS via the command line. Installed nmap to run port scans and give me the visuals into connected hosts so I can infiltrate them (kidding). 4 checks for ChromeOS so far!I also regularly use serial terminals to connect to various Cisco based firewalls, enterprise switches, routers, etc as well as network test tool platforms where I need a serial cable to perform initial configurations to it. Got a USB to Serial cable, installed ‘Beagle’, and now I have a serial cable. No laptops come with serial RS232 connections anymore. Check number 5 for ChromeOS!!!!And amazing battery life! This thing literally lasts 8-10 hours being used by a power user such as myself.I also do field work, am in and out of test lab environments with endless rows of network test equipment and every Cisco device under the tree. Those environments are noisy, hot, hostile and cramped. Because of this, I have no time to look after the well being of my equipment. They’re thrown around. I occasionally pound on keyboards, etc. This machine is surprisingly very solid and sturdy being that it’s all plastic (except on the top cover in the middle near the rear; little flimsy there) but overall, you can throw this thing around and it will take it.Of course, storage sucks, no cd/dvd drive, screen resolution is poor (because I’m coming from a Retina display) not too fast, nor not too slow, not much memory as I typically work with 20 Chrome tabs open at once. No GigE Ethernet port, but any USB to Ethernet Dongle will work if you need hard connectivity into the LAN. With that said, the versatility of the platform shines.What about my apps I use in the office? Google apps has that. Excel, power point, word, etc. I can access my work apps (email, ADP, Salesforce, etc) through our company’s web based app portal, I can remote control other computers using Microsoft Remote Desktop or TeamViewer. It can run WebEx sessions for remote meetings, I can install our Jabber chat client , I can install AnyConnect VPN client so I can VPN into my companies networks, I login to my iCloud account so I can sync my notes on my iCloud and all my iDevices, and then some. That adds 10 more checks for ChromeOS!!!!!!I didn’t realize that ChromeOS was a capable and flexible platform, until now. More useful than any tablets, even iPad that I have because of the flexibility and freedom I have with ChromeOS. Apple iOS is too closed off for my tastes.Extremely capable, durable, long battery life for $200. Can’t really ask for anything more.",0
It works perfect for simple stuff. Love it. No issues,0
"My son has a nice decent gaming rig, He always wants to play games with me, but I dont use a PC so we cant play anything together. I got this and not only is it fast, it runs games better than his full sized pc can. screen is nice, graphics crips and gets really good framerates in the games we play. I personally do not try to ultra out anything graphics wise and always opt for best quality to performance ratio. This has worked amazingly so far. Battery life is decent for a laptop.Turbo mode makes the fans go pretty loud. During heavy use fans can also get pretty loud. Not much you can do, but what do expect from a powerhouse that is packaged in a small case.RTX3060 graphics make games look amazing. really love this thing. Love the Keyboard and this thing is a beast.Great system, and perfect for being able to game anywhere.",0
In the begging the laptop was great. When I wanted to upgrade to windows 11. The bit locker recovery screen showed up and I can't recover the laptop. Can anyone help? I am reaching out to hp tomorrow.,0
Stop working already.,0
"Just like most other people are saying, the battery life is not the greatest. Plugged in, everything else is good. Remember to put the GPU in eco mode or use integrated graphics if you're not gaming on battery.",0
so far so good. very fast,0
I didn’t like the set up,0
100% good.,0
Hasta el momento no me a defraudado y el hecho que carga Windows en 10 segundos es genial.,0
"Gran velocidad de encendido, carga, ejecución de aplicaciones. último hardware en procesador, memoria, video, disco.

"This is my third chromebook, purchased only because my second chromebook needed to be up dated!. Set up was very easy; no problem transferring all of my files. Definitely a 5 star item, highly recommended!",0
Its sleek black and copper accents made it subtle but clean looking and while it has the power of a gaming laptop I can confidently bring this into meetings without looking like Im a washed out e-sports player with an alienware.,0
exxcellent,0
"This thing is amazing. I have owned several windows gaming laptops and this is hands down the best laptop I have ever purchased. The build quality is amazing, the chassis, hinge, keyboard, and mousepad all feel very high quality. the laptop is light and easy to carry around. The battery lasts what feels like a lifetime. The computer does not get hot at all (even after some heavy video editing and transcoding). Apple has truly made the best laptop on the market. Now to the negatives: I have read that the OS excessively uses virtual memory to speed up the system. After doing some initial tests I can confirm that this is true. What does this mean? this means that the Internal SSD might not last as long as it should because of the excessive write and read to the Solid state drive. I don't know I this is by design or what but it definitely feels kinda crummy for Apple to do this. I would still recommend this computer to anyone needing a laptop for school, creative work, or just general use. Buy it you won't regret it.",0
"PROs:+ Battery life (about 7-8 hours)+ lite weight, handy+ starts quickly+ Windows 10s lets less malware in.CONs:- I’ve heard the 32GB SSD hard drive is not enough for a general use laptop; however, for my needs (web surfing, writing documents) it is perfect.- Getting use to Windows 10s application restrictions (can’t install regular versions of MS Office, need to buy the App version; also I can’y install my normal VPN software).",0
The 144hz display is extremely crisp and smooth,0
"Bought this for my daughter who is in high school. I was very pleasantly surprised by the performance of this budget laptop. She uses flash based educational programs, watches YouTube and checks her gmail. No bloatware installed and it comes with 1 year of accidental damage when you register it. She loves the fingerprint reader, wide screen and the backlit keyboard. The camera is acceptable for video chatting and includes an led light when it is on. The chassis was surprisingly stiff for a budget laptop and the keyboard had acceptable feedback and feel. The screen quality isn't the best, but for a budget laptop, it is livable.",0
Not what I was expecting but a good machine nonetheless,0
This product has fan issues. The fan makes lots of noise and goes bad within couple of months. ASUS support is a piece of crap and they do not help at all.,0
"I've had this for about two months now. I'm really happy with it.Cheapest RTX 2070 laptop I could find. That's what I'm paying for, is a nice display and the solid graphics card. This is probably the best computer I've ever bought. If you're looking for a solid gaming-able laptop that isn't the absolute top tier, this is it!!I heavily recommend a cooling fan pad/stand, it will greatly increase airflow and keep your laptop cool and less noisy.The GL65 leaopard is 100 dollars cheaper than the GP65 leopard solely because the case is made of plastic and not aluminum. Fine by me, I don't plan on hauling this thing around, and I routinely clean fingerprints, so they don't bother me at all.MSI comes with their Dragon Center dashboard, which will show you CPU, memory, SSD usage and intenral temperatures. It will also allow you to control the keyboard LEDs, and set battery charge intervals. I like this dahsboard.The keyboard backlit LEDs are gorgeous.Bulky, but not particularly heavy. But this is expected of any laptop with a beefy (non-slim design) graphics card. I don't mind this, it mostly stays on my desk.Early wear on keyboard letters: The keys are clear plastic to show the LEDs, and are painted to show the letters ans symbols. This paint seems cheap and is already starting to fade through two months in.Trackpad click feels fragile. But who cares? Most gaming folks will use a mouseOnly 3 USB ports, you may need an adapter.I'm only concerned about the hinge system. I know this is a standard for MSI, but this mechanical part looks small, I'd hate for this wear and tear to break computer.Screen is matte and no glare means I can see nicely.I like having a number pad too!I'm willing to sacrifice a little on the SSD size for the great graphics card. To me, 500GB is plenty, I have external drives for any massive storage I may need.",0
"I've had this for two days and it's the fastest thing I've ever touched. But for my specific purposes, this laptop is the ideal.",0
monitor is so wide and I have enough monitor space to process other works at the same time,0
"This computer has given me nothing but problems since I’ve purchased it. Randomly shutting down, mouse not wanting to connect, freezing up…. Waste of money for my 10 year old. Can’t even return it now. I do not suggest buying this computer.",0
"great for surfing the web, doing homework, and similar tasks. Certainly not a gaming PC, but definitely a good buy if used properly",0
Amazing screen quality and refresh rate. The laptop does get quite hot when on turbo mode or playing AAA games on max/high settings. I recommend buying a laptop cooling pad as a precaution. No issues other than that.,0
I can't even look a websites that a much older laptop would display easily. Pinterest is unviewable with this machine. Unviewable. I need to view and project Pinterest for my painting classes.,0
"I did a lot of research before settling for G65 leopard, I've reviewed Asus ROG, Acer predator, helios in the similar price range and by far this machine is the best in class.I'm very impressed by this beast's performance, it can handle any AAA titles without flinching.Pros:RTX 2070 (8GB)!!i-7 10th genPer key RGB (u can customize it to great detail).Amazing true color display.Very efficient cooling.Con'sI would say NONE!(I'm not complaining about the battery considering the power-hungry internals)At this price, it's a killer deal. Go for it without having second thoughts.",0
perfect,0
"Sometimes when I write on social media, E-mails ect, if I use certain keys the curser jumps back causing me to have to reset it. Could be my fault. Otherwise I like it. My previous computer was very slow so I am impressed with the speed. I am happy with my purchase and I feel it was worth the money.",0
"After less than one month of use, the charge cord stopped working, I would expect better from Samsung",0
"This chromebook is great. It does what it's suppose to. I bought it for my son for school and he really likes it. It has all the capabilities to do Google classroom and Google docs. It is good quality for the price. The screen is not the best, I think it blurs at certain angles for privacy when using it in class or public places. I bought it used and very good condition through Amazon warehouse deals I ended up saving like 60 -70 bucks that way. It came in perfect condition just the box had been previously opened. It came with the charger and a manual. I would buy it again for myself or as a gift.",0
it really takes hours to make it work,0
"Loaded it with pictures , videos, and music , then sent it to relatives. Worked as it should.",0
"Ive inly been really using this laptop for like a month and a half but Its a good laptop. For rreference though My last laptop I had was used when I recieved it and ""on its last legs"" and started having noticible issues once it turned 11 years old...I enjoy doing video editing and that over a decade old laptop was no longer covering it so I decided to inest in this laptop. With its core I7 processer of 16gb of ram its doing really well amd seems to not struggle at all for what I do and or need. Its a good computer cabale of doing lots of work and the battery life is superb. I ran a couple of stress tests on it and it preformed well. The one downside is that because its windows 11 alot of stuff that was free and or included on windows 10 or lower is not included , most of the software thats available on this laptop is consistent of free trials or trying to get you to make a yearly purchase to use the programs such as the microsoft suite ( which will run 99$ a year or the price of like 9.99 a month). And the free trials are short lived or require you to put in credit card info...so I would suggest anyone who gets this laptop to be ready to either pay for what use to be free or start doing research on free open source software that is comparable to whatever programs you may want to use that are no longer free on the windows platform. Windows 11 isnt really bad its just different. As for the hardware I suggest doing your research before buying this laptop, and make sure you get the correct processer type for what you do, core I3 or below will not cut it in most cases try core i5 or higher and get atleast 16gb of ram aka memory to be on the safe side for anything other then really light light computer use. Also since this is a thinner laptop it has no cd rom and can in some cases overheat a little as it needs some ventalation when in use if doing heavy duty work which is to be expected for its thinness, and my very slight complaint is that while doing heavy duty work it can get to humming a bit too loudly for my taste but nothing that is too terribly concerning. I reccomend this laptop and I love it thus far.",0
"immersive screen ,1080p is perfect for 13invery light weight & good soundvery good materialseverything as expected",0
I bought this specifically for travel. Battery barely lasts 3 hours. Absolute garbage.,0
"I have used this computer for renderings in 3dsmax and it works well, sometimes with Autocad is weird but I'm not sure if that is because of the new Windows it has, maybe it is not good with Autocad. The battery isn't that good, it sounds really loud when you activate the turbo but overall this is a good computer, the cost of it is proportional to the quality. I don't regret it.",0

Overall the laptop is fast i was surprised at the sp[eed of the laptop for the price on games and on design software packages. Going in i knew it was not top grade hardware but the price performance was and still is great. Battery life... was never expecting much .. overall the laptop is a steal. However the damn thing just would not turn on one day. It died 6 months into purchasing it and using it lightly for sofa gaming or odd kitchen table work. Desktop does all the heavy lifting. It was purchased to be able to be more remote during pandecmi to move around in my home. I recommend it as price perfomance for sure but build quality and the fact to return for warranty with acer im having to pay for shipping etc. Sigh anyways great price performance but total fail on costumer support and build quality,0

"Judging by the looks of it, they made the ideapad 330s series that this is a little more boxier...the optane definitely works...i installed my music software faster...if you were attached to the realtek wireless adapters, this version of the 330s has qualcomm wireless adapters...its just as fast just a little different...the range is about 2 % shorter...i'm satisfied....not enough reason to return it..the harddrive data transfer is faster...its just more of a compulsion that you would compare the pros and cons without satisfaction...the ONLY problem with this laptop is that the network adapter was different...it has a shorter range...but sometimes faster downloads and the same uploads...i'm just worried about the review i read about its durability",0

"The actual machine is very slim, very light, and easily portable. I love the touch on the keyboard, but just hate that it doesn't have the number pad on the right side (but I knew that before I bought it).I don't do any kind of gaming, so I can't rate it for that; and this machine doesn't have the touch screen either, so there's no rating for that.So far, the fingerprint ID is working well. I'm still a little leery of it as many other reviewers said it stopped working relatively soon after purchase.I haven't tested the battery life on it, as I just keep it plugged in on my desk.What I can say is this computer is slow; to download a video in an email, I just hit ""Download"", then go do something else for a while.This computer is my first experience with Windows 10, and Windows 10 is pure awful, horrible, disastrous, and a huge mistake for Microsoft. The start-up page is a mess , full of cutesy little pictures for those who can't read. An adult operating system is preferable to all the flashing lights, pretty pictures, and cartoon characters necessary to keep juveniles stimulated. I really miss Windows 7. MSN is a terrible news feed, also filled with lots of cutesy pictures, again for those who are too lazy to read actual words. Oh, BTW, MSN, there's more news out there other than that pertaining to celebrities!The Maps and Photo programs are lousy, and I can't seem to be able to get the cutesy little rolling weather gadget to give a reading on anywhere but Washington, D.C.The email program that came on the computer is awful. Gotta figure out how to get rid of it and get Microsoft Outlook.Anyway, long story short, I really like the computer - I just don't like the software. I may be able to get the Geek Squad to reprogram this thing for me.",0

"I have been using computers since the early eighties with my first one having 16KB of ram. After discovering this notebook by Samsung on Amazon I had to get it as my other general-purpose laptop was an HP core i3 going on 5 years old. So far, I am very satisfied.The GalaxyBook2 is a revolution in modern day computing as far I am concerned. It is super lite weight and packs the processing power of a modern desktop. I bought this laptop for my lazy days when I still have to work but do not want to sit behind my desk. I have no doubt it will pay for itself over time for increasing my productivity.As far as portability you simply are not going to find a more perfect notebook. At first, I was torn between the cheaper HP core i7 and this one and had a hard time justifying the $500 price difference (at the time) but am glad I spent the extra money for the GalaxyBook2.",0

She's not a very tech-savvy person at all, and her main use for a computer is for checking facebook/her email, ordering things, and watching some movies/videos. Its simple enough that she is able accomplish everything she needs, which has thankfully minimized her calling me to help walk her through simple tasks. While it is simple enough for her to use on her own, it also simultaneously gives her the joy of having a personal computer that she can take anywhere.I would definitely recommend this Chromebook for anyone that only needs to accomplish basic online/computer tasks and does not care about/have the need for having something with great performance.",0

Phone call to Asus assistance ( Mr George and later Mr Jason) provided no assistance for two days in a row. Took the unit to Asus Bugis junction Service Centre and after check on serial no, they told the unit sent to us does not have screen pad or touch screen features. Now we are to box back the unit and make arrangements for airfreight back to USA.What a blunder to rely on ASUS.I will not recommend purchases from this company. Why not service centre would handle return and refund when they clearly knew their US counterpart had blown it all",0

"Buying into the Apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money, but, do not make them a critical part of your workflow. They are too expensive for that. Apple just does not make good computers. Yes, they make a OK operating system, but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in.You can't just go and buy the parts to fix your Mac computers when they break. The MacBook Air is no exception to this. The SSD is solider to the motherboard. Likewise the RAM. Now, if that were the only problem, well -- one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after Apple stop warranty coverage -- maybe. But, they don't even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public. So, once the warranty is. up -- you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer. Needless to say, this is a major flaw in Apple products -- of which it is no exception for this MacBook Air. (Oh, and if they start allowing suppliers to supply, but, lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e-waste.)Also, this computer flickers with a 4K output. The MacBook Air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the HooToo dock that I've used with an Intel MacBook Pro which is a few years old. This is unacceptable. Apple's response to the sometimes frying the computer for using USB-C docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing.Though poorly engineered in terms of video, ssd, and RAM. It is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard. If you are willing to let that guide you, then, the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their Intel Mac plugged in and worked just fine. (Supposedly Apple fix this with an OS update -- good for them.)Even though I dislike the Mac, it is better than most laptops -- because it is quiet since it has no fan. Would I buy one again? Perhaps -- it is a question of whether I think the market exists for me to make money off of it.The good things:Keyboard, touchpad, Built-In Screen, Build-In Speakers, Drives External Audio better than Microsoft Windows, and the Operating System is less cluttered than is Windows. Also, comes with a Spreadsheet, Word Processor, Presentation Program -- now, it is better just to use something really Libre -- like LibreOffice. But, it is kind of nice the table steaks are included -- unlike for Microsoft Windows.",0
"Everything about this machine has been fantastic. I could not afford new, but I have found this only a hairsbreadth less than spanking new. Best for me, since I was away from the wonderful Apple side for several years, Apple help is as fine as the machine. Plan to go this route next time.",0

"I love this machine, but having only one USB 3.1 port has proven to be a problem. I have a dongle for a wireless mouse, I have an external 4TB Western Digital Passport, obviously, I can’t use both at the same time. So I shopped USB hubs, and there are basically none that will consistently/competently drive both the dongle and the HD. You have to have a powered HUB to run both. This stinks, because I use a laptop desk and have no desire to plug anything in. For those who just use the desktop powered hub at the same stationary desk near an outlet, or only need to run one USB 3.1 port on the go, it’s fine. But it’s a real disappointment for me. They have to dump something to keep the Laptop so thin, but I really miss the extra port. My last laptop, had 3 USB ports, but it didn’t transform into a really nice tablet. 😂",0

"MSI has once again proven they are masters of their craft. The GL66 offers uncompromising performance in a case that is one of the nicest looking laptops I've seen on the market. If you want to run Battlefield, COD or Genshin Impact at max settings, this laptop will do it without dropping below 60 fps. Not only that, but if you are on the road, the battery life is typically about 2.5 hours while gaming if you select a lower battery usage level.All this being said, it is on the heavier side for a laptop if that is important to you. The mousepad is also considerably smaller than similarly priced laptops such as the Acer Predator.Overall, if you want the best deal on Amazon regarding a gaming laptop this would be your best bet.",0
Is this a new laptop? It keeps logging me out of the internet. It’s happened so many times since I bought it. Can you please advise. I’m thinking of returning it.,0

"11th Gen Intel Quad-Core i5-1135G7, 20GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD, Backlit Keyboard, WiFi 6, HDMILikes:1. The keyboard is nice to type on. At least compared to most laptops I've used. Nothing like a mechanical keyboard though.2. The bios has decent options. I don't like fan sounds and I was able to put it into a battery saver mode that keeps things cool enough so the fan doesn't kick on very often.3. It's pretty snappy. Especially coming in and out of hibernation.4. The price was right. I use this as a secondary computer that I use on the couch. I have a beefy desktop for work, and media creation. This is the largest factor that contributed to 4 stars instead of 3.5. The keyboard is backlit, but it has to be turned on with fn + SpaceDislikes:1. All the plastic. I'm not a fan of plastic chassis. The laptop feels cheaper than the internal components would lead you to believe.2. It said Wifi 6, but it is definitely not. I've updated drivers to no avail. The card registers as ""ac"" in device manager, not ""ax"".3. The screen. While large and bright, the color accuracy is atrocious. I would never work in Lightroom or Photoshop on this display. I've spent a good hour in the Intel graphics utility attempting to get some balance, but that effort was in vein. I sat it next to my desktop and even the icon colors for OneNote and Chrome were so far off it's laughable.4. No USB-C charging. This is quite irritating since the only way to charge is with a barrel plug.",0

"This laptop was everything I had hoped for and it is incredibly packed with features for anywhere near the price. Since I'm a Prime member, it arrived in two days flat. Nice! The packaging and shipping was excellent, the laptop box itself is packed in its slim cardboard packing with a perfect fit and then packed in an outer box as well. Absolutely no damage, dents or bruises at all. AC Adapter and minimal documentation included (no media). There's really nothing else needed, it appears to have one of the newer kinds of battery that's internal and not user changeable, and it charges well. On the initial screens you can choose to turn OFF all the slide controls that offer to send info to Microsoft. (recommended).One thing you have to be prepared for due to Windows 10, is that as soon as you reach the place where you give it whatever means of internet connection you use - it takes over and begins the update cycle. The large 3GB Windows 10 ver 1709 takes some patience, so just let it do it's thing and give it as much as several hours. You want to make sure that it's all up to date first before you go in and tweek things. So don't begin that process until you can spare several hours, and you'll be in good shape.It came with what I'd call minimal bloatware. Some folks want that stuff, I did not. I uninstalled xbox gaming, MS Store, an eBay shortcut and several other items I had no use for. The 30-day eval of MS Office wasn't going to do me any good so I uninstalled that as well. Less than 10 minutes lost to cleanup - no problem. Looking at the add/remove programs listing in the Control Panel, you can see it comes with the usual nice collection of Acer utilities, so don't remove those. And when you do finish the installation and have it configured just the way you want, take the time to do a Windows Image backup to an external USB drive, along with a Restore DVD, that's your very best means of recovery later on if you ever crash your drive.This is a very well-made laptop and the best by far of any of the several former Acer laptops I've owned in the past. Sturdy, powerful, loaded with all the latest and fastest ports, (you have to love the 802.11ac WiFi, it's a screamer) - along with a 1TB drive, plenty of RAM and expandable to a whopping 32GB - it's a great buy and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone wanting high performance in a low-cost package. Everyone has their preferences, true - but I give this model 5 stars for Amazon's packing, shipping, and Acer's very best product line yet. And I'm an IT Professional of some 24 years, so I get my hands on some very top-dollar laptops for business. I think you'll be pleased with this one!",0

"This new ASUS model was just what I wanted, a 4-core i7, 16GB of RAM, 4GB of graphics, 256GB of SSD and 1TB of HDD, as well as its connections 3.0 and 3.1 Type C.It is very thin and very light, with an incredible touch, and built in golden, brutal aluminum.The screen is of very good quality, although you will always have to have 100% brightness.Its keyboard is very pleasant to the touch and also its backlighting is adjustable.The S.O is installed as standard on the SSD, in my case, it starts in 12 seconds.Nothing overheats, its ventilation system is excellent, and almost the best of all is its audio system, which is from the same manufacturer that collaborates with BMW, ""Harman / Kardon"", they have a brutal clarity and a very powerful sound.I ordered the laptop from Spain with the express delivery, and despite having been importing, I have not had any problem with the customs, everything has been very easy and in a very short time.Who buy it from Spain, who knows that it does not have the letter ""ñ"", but there are ways to use it, I would recommend putting it as a Spanish language, and as a keyboard the ""international American"" to use the keyboard correctly and to the Time to write allows you to put the accents correctly.In short, it has been a great purchase, very happy, and for a much lower price than in Spain, where the same model would come for € 1700-1900 ($ 1,900-2,100), and thanks to the imported order, the total cost including The customs fees to Spain has been € 1170 ($ 1330).",0

I noticed that when using the laptop screen on a shallow angle to the keyboard it was far worse.

I do not see any white bleeding from the back light at all anymore around the lower bezel.The laptop is a solid unit.

"Honestly, this laptop sucks. I'm a college student and specifically bought it for class use/homework. All I need it to do is connect to the internet, let me use Word and PowerPoint, and have good batter life. However, the battery is laughably pathetic.The laptop itself is ok I suppose, but when it is advertise as having ""8 hour battery life. Full workday freedom."", then that is what I expect and paid for. You're lucky if you get 3 or 4 hours of this thing.I don't use it for very intense things. It doesn't have a high end processor, it's running Intel i5 which is very low on the rung, it doesn't have an nvidia graphics card or anything like that, and I don't play video games on it. Like I said, I need it to connect the internet, let me download things for my classes, email my professors, use Word and PowerPoint, and yes, get on YouTube sometimes. That's it. Very low, bare minimum requirements. Yet when this thing has a full charge and I use it for small trivial things, 2 hours later I'll look and my battery will be at 45%...how?! Again, I used it for bare minimum processes and you're going to tell me that it killed my battery to write a quick paper, or review a PowerPoint lecture? Pathetic.Even in sleep/rest mode the batter drains a stupid amount. It will be on like 80%, I'll put it into sleep/rest mode, come back to it 3 or 4 hours later and now the battery is on 35%.

Trackpad is really frustrating to use to. I like my old ibm thinkpad track pad a lot more. This one seems to double click a ton and stick. Built in mic is generally not very good. It will work but you really need something else. Webcam is the same grainy webcam you would expect, if it works.My major issue is that this comes with a 3.5 combo jack. If I plug my headphones in they do not work. If I plug them in and restart the pc they work great until you unplug them then you need to restart again. If I try and use a splitter and use a mic + headphones it won't work. Attempted to use headphones + built in mic and also doesn't work. Webcam+ headphones doesn't work either. Asus slow and and clunky support took 30 mins of chat time before I was told to reinstall stuff again. He gave me the support number and after being put on hold several times I was told it needed to be RMA'd. Sadly I'm in Alaska right now and it would be nearly 2 months just in shipping time. I'm basically stuck for the next few months till I go home before I can do anything with it.Will be avoiding asus in the future. Generally had ok products from them but if support is this bad / slow it isn't worth risking it when something goes wrong",0
Great laptop but plagued by Poor quality control. Dead pixels on screen and it is most definitely not all metal construction. Screen has terrible viewing angles. Would not recommend to buy.,0
"I've had this laptop for about 2 weeks now and overall it works ok so far, although I've noticed a couple of issues. For context, I haven't played a single game on the laptop yet and most of the time has been spent on web browser or using 1 or 2 engineering software (they aren't super intensive).I expected the computer to be more responsive than it currently is. For instance, I turned off the Bluetooth to play audio from my speakers and it took about 40s for it to start working (drivers fully updated). Once or twice it has frozen / lagged for a bit although not often. Battery is only about 3 hours currently (it drains a lot of juice, but that's expected for a gaming laptop). The worst issue of all so far that has me really worried is with the trackpad. Very often now it has wandered where it wants to and been unresponsive for several seconds. It starts doing a dance randomly through the screen and I'm not sure what's happening. Overall, you can tell the trackpad is on the cheap side. There also isn't any liquid / food oils on the touch pad so I am unsure why it does this.",0
"a great little machine, love it!",0
i wanted something small to do hw and i didnt want anything expensive since i'll only do school work in it and nothing else. I'ts quite amazing. I recommend. didn't came broken or anything,0
"I recently bought this as a gift for myself for school use. The picture shows a black, sleek looking laptop. What came was a dull, gray boring laptop. I was disappointed it didn't look like what was presented. But, I figured I might as well try it out. It has been two months now, and I hate how annoying it is. It functions as a tablet with apps instead of a windows or apple configuration. My fault, I should've done more research on it. But I just want Word to work on it...and no matter what I do, it never works correctly. I'm just disappointed overall. I should've just sent it back and gotten something better. Would not recommend. Spend a little more and get a more quality product.",0
"I got this for gaming and it is super loud due to the fans. I even have it on a fan pad to help with cooling. It's only loud during gaming. Normal use is fine. But, it runs great! The battery will not last long if you're gaming, maybe 2 hours. So, keep it plugged in.",0
Love the mobility of this.,0
Meet my expectations,0
The picture show the description on the website. There's a Sim Card slot. But the Laptop I received does not have any Sim Card Slot. Wrong Laptop.,0

In Battery Saver Mode you're looking at 3.5 hrs of life.... Will need to upgrade to 80w battery unless you are planning on keeping this thing plugged in all the time or use in short bursts. Unfortunately the 80w battery seems to be sold out everywhere.,0
"I bought a Samsung Chromebook 11.6 in model in 2012, and it has been amazing. However, after heavy use, it was time to purchase a new one (it still works wonderfully when plugged in, but the battery is dead and I didn't want to invest in a sub-par battery. I intend to use my old Chromebook as a desk-top ""computer"" for my students at work).I thought I would just purchase the latest version of the same brand and size, ordered the Samsung Chromebook 3, and eagerly awaited the machine, knowing that set up would be a snap and that all of my bookmarks, documents, and etc. would follow when I booted up the new version. This was all as expected, but I am not a happy customer. Why? Because the trackpad on this model when two finger scrolling is atrocious! It doesn't register my fingers, or if it does, lags and stutters. None of this happened/happens with my old Samsung Chromebook--it's as snappy and responsive as the first day I plugged it in. I thought it might just be that the particular Chromebook I received had a problem, and I even contacted Samsung and chatted online with a service representative who told me it was a hardware issue and I should return it or send it in for servicing. As I had owned it all of 10 hours, I returned it to Amazon and ordered a new one. Sadly, this machine is even more glitchy than the first! Is anyone else having this problem? I am so frustrated and disappointed, since I am very happy with every other aspect of the new model. This problem, however, makes the Chromebook virtually unusable. I am not interested in carrying around a mouse, so that isn't a fix--The track-pad should WORK!! Grrr!Has anyone else had this problem? Is there a solution? Is the brand new Flagship model 3 (released two days after I ordered mine) any better?",0
My grand daughter had no complaints. She is enjoying her Chromebook.,0
"I upgraded the 3060 version with one TEAMGROUP T-FORCE CARDEA ZERO Z330 1TB, and a TEAMGROUP Elite DDR4 32GB Kit (2 x 16GB) 3200MHz PC4-25600 CL22 kit, the SSD NVME was not immediatly recognized, but I only had to give it NTFS format due to unallocated memory data, no BIOS settings needed for it to detect it afterwards, I have not yet tested its performance, but the screen has at least 350 NITs, overall feels very solid.Will update after testing.",0
"This is a small light laptop, I needed a new one after my clunky Toshiba was running slow, and getting outdated. I wanted a light, fast and small laptop, which this is, but the battery life stinks, face recognition stinks, does not always detect and the touch screen often freezes the whole laptop.Likes, fast, light, easy to set upDislikes, battery life, touch screen glitches.",0
"Absolutely the worst purchase I could have made. This laptop does not allow you to upgrade your RAM memory. The RAM is soldered onto the hard drive with no way of replacing it for an upgrade. The amount of system memory on this device is so small that I am unable to adequately even use the computer with the computer telling me it is running low in space. I don’t even have Microsoft Office installed on this computer or even use it for gaming. I use it only to surf the web, and it still tells me I am low on space. It also doesn’t allow you to download Google Chrome or anything that isn’t a Microsoft product unless you switch out of “S” mode. You have to jump through hoops to even use your laptop the way you should. If I were you, I would simply upgrade to a more expensive laptop. You will be glad you did.",0
The description says that the laptop is 512 GB. Mine has only 475 GB.I payed lot of money for this machine and it’s quite disappointing that you don't get what they advertise.,0

"The Lenovo Legion 5 with RTX 3050Ti is an amazing gaming laptop for around the $1,000~ price point.While it is true that the 3050 and 3050Ti are the lowest tier GPUs of the RTX 3000 (mobile) series, for casual gaming this laptop delivers some great performance and graphics, do keep in mind that a lot of recent AAA titles won't play at the highest graphical settings compared to if you were using a higher tier GPU like the 3060, 3070 or 3080, but for the types of games I personally play, the 3050Ti still performs great at an affordable price.The device itself is very well built, the outside is made of plastic but it feels solid, the keyboard feels nice to type and game on, the trackpad is ok but using a mouse is preferable, speakers aren't amazing but don't sound terrible either, the camera is there and it's whatever but you at least get a switch to physically disable it at any time. The display on this is great, it gets very bright, the refresh rate is of 165z, and the color accuracy is respectable. Thermals haven't been a problem with the games that I've thrown at this device, there are three fans settings to pick from: quiet, balance, and performance, even at performance mode I can barely just hear the fans kick in when a lot is happening on the screen, plus this cooling pad that I got from ""havit"" seems to help it a bit.Maybe my only two nitpicks (that aren't too big of a deal for me to take stars away from this product), is that the keyboard has a number pad, which is more of a subjective taste but I personally just don't ever use the number pad on any keyboard, and the second nitpick is the fact that out of the box this laptop comes with 512* GB of storage (more like 475 GB considering how much storage system files take up), but on the bright side there is a second SSD slot inside the device so storage can be upgraded in the future.If you couldn't tell, I am very happy with this laptop so far, especially considering how I went from a laptop with an AMD A12 with integrated Radeon Graphics to a Ryzen 7 5800H with RTX 3050Ti, like, over half of my Steam library has now unlocked and become playable!(Also, say ""hi"" to my Clairen plush from the picture).",0
"Battery dies fast, but in other aspects this laptop is 10/10!",0
the sound is great and it has some audio stabilization ability so when you blast a song it lowers the levels so it doesn't pop your speakers,0
good job lenovo,0
"Good for what it's worth.I'm not a fan of the price, but guess it's just another Apple thing.Great laptop for daily use.The key keyboard is great. I'm not a professional on computers so I'll usually have to look at the keyboard while I type, but not on this one the keys are positioned perfectly.Nice and crisp resolution.Pretty fast.All around great daily use laptop.",0
The screen is really incredible and the bezels are so small that it just looks like one whole screen!,0
item has failed Need support help,0
"All good. Great laptop. perfect size and decent battery life. Exactly what I needed. My only problem is that the fan sometimes makes some noise and gets heated up pretty fast, and it's just my second day! It would make some noise for a few mins and then go back to normal. I'm just pretty concerned that it's only my second day of using it..",0
"My father and I got this for my mom to replace her little Asus chromebook. What a nightmare...First of all, it's big, it's pretty. But it's slow. Her pages weren't loading at all, and this is with sufficient internet. Everyone else in the house was blazing. She however, was not.I think this computer has a processing problem. Maybe the motherboard or the graphics card is crappy. But I don't know if this is a lemon, or a common problem. But I'd return it if it wasn't already past it's return date...Would not get again.",0
Very nice computer for price. Battery only lasts a few hours when not plugged in. Heard that is fairly common in similar laptops. All round very nice for everything.,0
Trustworthy,0
"Even for the little amount, it is not worth the money. It has a limited Windows to start with. This makes it impossible to do anything. Once you get around that, it is incredibly slow and crashes constantly. The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. But it is lightweight, so I guess that’s what they got going for them. Honestly, not worth the money.",0
"My laptop died last year, so I've been tied to a desktop for awhile. I wanted something light that I could travel with and mostly use for streaming, internet, and some class work. This is perfect. It's crazy light, the battery lasts around 12 hours, it's fast, and doesn't stutter with as many chrome tabs open as you want (I've read reviews of other Chromebooks have trouble if you open more than about 5 tabs). A touch screen would be nice, but then you wouldn't get it for $169, so it's fine.",0
Good for both gaming and documentation.This review is to receiving a warranty extension from ASUS for the feedback in order to receive ninety (90) day warranty extension,0

Worst product I have ever bought off amazon. Couldn’t load a webpage. Do not buy.,0
"Be aware that this Chromebook Model # 11-v025wm (linked below) is not compatible with the Google Play Store app. While you are able to access the Play Store from the internet, you cannot download applications to the Chromebook. This was confirmed by first attempting to download applications and then speaking with HP technical support.If using Google Play Store is not a factor for you, the laptop may be okay for general internet use and to access programs on the internet.If it is an issue, the HP tech cited these two consumer HP Chromebook Model #s as being compatible with Google Play Store - 1) HP X360-11 and 2) HP X2-12. I don't know if these are bonafide models, but am passing these details along.The tech also cited the HP Chromebook HP 11G5 as a commercially available model and could not confirm its compatibility with Play Store. However, I'd previously purchased one and it was compatible, but I had to send it back because the touchpad was not consistently working.Overall, if compatibility matters to you, I would suggest doing your own research to make sure the laptop has the features you desire. Looking at the official Google Chromebooks blog for updated listings of Chromebooks compatible with Google Play Store may help.Chromebook not compatible with Google Play Store from my experience:",0
Just amazingly fast with great display. Battery is just ok like many other laptops. Hope next release in 2021 will add couple more hours to the battery life.,0

Screen quality is a 50/50 for me I had a faulty screen and got my laptop replaced....sucks though because it was brand new and had screen issues. Be careful with this one other than that the computer has been great and been meeting my demands. Battery life isn’t great but it’s a gaming laptop so expect it.,0
If this would have the correct dwscription I would have given five stars.,0
"So I got this for my wife Feb of last year, she plays sims 4 and I have GTA/Apex on it with no issues, now all the sudden there are small lines and discoloration at the bottom of rhe screen, I took it apart and checked the fans and they are good. The keyboard gets hot at times. I bought another laptop same as this but better specs for cheaper price.and it does not get that hot. I guess I'll have to get a cooling pad for it.",0
"So I got this laptop for both me and my son. My son knows all the ins and outs of laptops and all the computer lingo. Me? Not so much. I know enough to use it for watching movies, email, the occasional writing I do, and web surfing. So basically I use it for basic tasks so that is what I’m going to base my review around.This laptop is almost 5 pounds but it’s feels really solid. The keyboard is a little more clicky than my old Mac laptop but I don’t mind it. I was really excited about it being touch screen as I’m not a huge fan of touch pads, mostly because I grew up using a mouse so that’s what I’m used to. While I really love the option of touchscreen and use it a decent amount, the fingerprints on the screen are terrible looking on this. The touchscreen definitely needs a screen protector that’s anti fingerprint and anti glare. However I’m having a really hard time finding any kind of accessories for this as it’s so new. Which I knew would be a problem for a a month or so when I got it. Everything is very easy to find and do on here. Even for someone whom has had a MacBook for years it’s pretty self explanatory. And anything I can’t figure out I use utube to find. Haha.The only issue I have has that my son pointed out there’s a known issue with the touchpad and ours definitely has it as you can see in the video. What is troubling about this is that the box that it came in had multiple shipping labels and it looks like this was shipped to amazon, shipped back to dell, presumably to fix this issue, then sent back to amazon then to me. And it’s still really bad. I personally don’t use the touchpad enough to bother getting it fixed and my son said he isn’t that worried about it. But i know I would be very annoyed if I paid over $2,000 for a laptop and it still has this issue even after getting sent back to be fixed.",0

"I don't know what this is but I wanted a Chromebook to replace my old one which I LOVED. This thing gets hot. It apparently needs updates?? I'm not sure what that's about. I've had safety issues as well. This reminds me more of a laptop than a Chromebook. I didn't want to worry about viruses, safety issues, or updates, which was the whole point! I you want a tiny cheap laptop this is for you but if your looking for fast worry-free internet surfing well I don't know what to tell ya. Be sure and get a lap pillow because the battery gets HOT right out of the box.",0

"I have one model earlier than this laptop, and it has been almost exactly 1 year since I bought it. I bought this laptop because I needed something cheap that I could use for 3D work on the go, take into meetings, etc.This is a really fantastic laptop if you want a good price for great performance. In its unused time, I have been running it 24/7 constantly calculating BOINC calculations for the SETI massive parallel computation project. This is a killer calculation that is very hard on computers, maxing out both the CPU and the GPU simultaneously. My Macbook air overheated and totally died after just a few months running like this. Two of my desktops also choked on it. This laptop, though, gets really hot, but just keeps on going!Performance wise, it has been great for just about every game I have played on it. It's pretty close to desktop level performance. I also was running the Oculus Rift with it (on a GTX 1060 card) without issue, so the newer model with even upgraded specifications should be great for such tasks.Reliability wise, it's just kept on going. It has be very dependable.It's a larger laptop, so maybe not for everyone. It gets hot in use, and it is really hungry for power with a quite short battery life. It's enough to get through a meeting, but if I'm the presenter I will always bring my power brick.I cannot speak for their tech support / service, as I never had the need, which I guess is good.We bought several others for folks at my work, and they have all been running great as well, as far as I know.Bottom line: This is a great ""lots of power for the money"" laptop that has been super reliable for me, and I would recommend it to anyone with similar needs to me, but not if all you need a super lightweight long battery life unit for just email and facebook.",0

"This model does not have the additional SSD port that's advertised. It does have the SATA SSD slot for 2.5"". The speakers are not very loud at all.

"QUICK SUMMARY: Lenovo has created an excellent, power-packed system in a surprisingly pleasant form factor. The system is quiet, VR capable, and an excellent portable gaming system.I don't have any major complaints about the laptop. My only issues are nitpicky at best.BENCHMARKS:- Hitman at 1080p all settings maxed using the Dual GPU setting and DX12: Average 57fps- Ashes of the Singularity on Crazy preset at 1080p DX11: Average 32fps- Rise of the Tomb Raider at 1080p Very High preset DX12: Average 58fpsWHAT I LIKE:The system peaked at 50db of fan noise during benchmarking. To put that in perspective, that’s only ~5db higher than one of our normal gaming desktops idling.We tested with virtual reality (VR), and the test was successful. We played Skyrim VR, Superhot VR, and Space Pirate Trainer without any lagging or motion sickness on an HTC Vive. This system is impressively small for its VR form factor.Surprisingly pleasant keyboard, the keys have more travel than the latest MacBook Pros. Gaming feels natural on the keyboard, and I saw no reason to use an external one. The backlighting is well done and can be toggled off if desired.The screen is gorgeous; matte 1080p looks very clean. Colors are vividly reproduced, and the screen is extremely bright.The spinning disk in the system performed admirably; I didn’t observe any significant load times in games installed to it. The NVMe drive also runs very quickly, faster than standard SATA SSDs. (see screenshot).I like the overall body of the system, it feels very pleasant to hold and looks quite striking.WHAT COULD BE BETTER:Unfortunately, there was some Lenovo crapware which I had to remove. The junk was both Windows 10 apps as well as standard programs.The NumPad isn’t laid out like full keyboard. The top line of numbers is higher than normal, and the math signs are on the right instead of the top. This sacrifice was made to keep a full set of arrow keys, which gamers will appreciate.I had some difficulty getting updated drivers for the GPU. I tried both the mobile and desktop GPU drivers, but neither one thought the system was compatible. Eventually, I had to download GeForce Experience which found and installed the drivers with no hassle.The system is heavy as you might expect with gaming laptops. This is not your lightweight, business-class laptop!The rubber strips on the bottom of the system which protrude a half-centimeter from the bottom of the laptop. I found these strips would get caught on the inside of my backpack.CONCLUSION: I used to unplug and move my bulky, gaming desktop computer to a friend's house when we were going to game all night. Now I take this Lenovo laptop laptop with me, and it's way easier to transport. Recommended for the gamers in your home!",0

Well I have done a lot of research before I bought this laptop and let me tell you that after months of searching for something in the same budget there is nothing that comes close to this laptop. The screen size was an important factor for me. I have only had the laptop for about 3 days now and I work on it mostly for video editing and till now it's perfect. Just a heads up I had to install a new copy of windows 10 Because the version it came with was lagging and full of bloat ware.,0
After trying to work with it to make it work for simple applications it just is not a good computer. If I could return it I would. Worst purchase I have ever made on AMAzon.,0

"I have used this laptop three full charge cycles now- from 100% till power off. So far, I'm liking this laptop. Maybe it's the newness of it. Either way beware of what you're getting into though. For the price range, it's decent. The screen is okay. The trackpad is okay. The price is okay for the specs.The keyboard, too, is okay. I hate that I have to press an extra key for Page Up/Down and Home/End functions. Also, the new (right click) key between Right-alt and Right-ctrl is useless is everyday use.However, the two things I found stupid and annoying are:1) The power button, and2) The low battery mechanism.Let me explain. The power button is at the top right corner of this okay keyboard. Top right is where we instinctively hit Backspace/Delete at. Couple times, I put this laptop on sleep mode while typing. Horrible placement.Also, when the laptop shows the ""battery low"" error, you have to run like hell for the charger. Thrice, I noticed, this device would show me an average of 1 hour 15 minutes at 10-11%. But the minute it goes from 10% to 9%, it automatically powers down. Yes! It completely turns itself off at 9%! How stupid is this. I'll try to change the settings, if it exists. Otherwise, I'll just have to get used to with using only 90% of the battery.",0

There was a black pitchfork the edge that worked its way across the screen. The product was defective. It cost us over $100 from our refund to ship and return the product.

"I bought 2 of these over the summer for distance learning - I have 2 similarly aged kids who are on video calls for school 3 hours a day, usually simultaneously. The headphone jacks are defective - they rarely, and only intermittently, recognize when headphones are plugged in. Sometimes restarting the whole system will help, but not always. I've tried 3 sets, so it's obviously a hardware issue. I suspect it's a build defect, not a QC issue, since it's happening on both machines. Even when we need to use the external speakers, those are terrible, too - my kid can barely hear his teacher even hovered over the keyboard with the volume turned up to 100. What a total waste of money.",0
This thing is a beast. I love it. I bought it based off of positive reviews and this community was right. The fan is loud and battery life is low but that's expected with a dope azz lappie top. I would recommend this bad Barbara to anyone looking for a rad lappy.,0

Nice computer,0
"I wanted to write a review about this to say first, lots of the reviews I read comment on the backlighting of the keyboard and how it turns off after 30 seconds and there is nothing you can do to change that. I found that is incorrect. The computer has a ""NITRO"" control center and inside that window there is a little settings wheel in the top right corner, if you click that button, you can choose to click off the selection to turn off the backlighting after 30 seconds. I found the keys going dark every 30 seconds to be super annoying but now they stay on all the time and it's great! I did not buy this for gaming, my company IT department recommended a gaming type of laptop for the computing needs of my job and this was one they recommended. The system works well for my needs. I enjoy the high resolution screen, seamless program operation, plug in options, soft touch keys, and many other features of this laptop. I travel for work at times and this is heavy and large to travel with, but I accept the trade off for the computing power that I need on the budget I have. I would recommend.",0

"I bought this laptop on May 29 and received it on June 8, it took longer than expected to arrive, but it was because it was not in stock. The outer case in perfect condition, comes in a briefcase-type box, which gives it a premium view, everything comes perfectly, the packaging of the accessories is great, the protection for the laptop is very careful. Before buying it I saw many videos about this line of laptops, I read many reviews here on amazon, where they criticized the sound of the speakers, but in my personal experience they sound at a level of 95% without distortion, it is clear crystal clear, the screen is great for this laptop (great refresh rate), the keyboard has multiple options to customize the rgb effects (including turning off the rgb light), it is compatible with steelseries devices for rgb effects, it is also compatible with all devices MSI for rgb effects with MYSTIC LIGHT application (I have keyboard, mouse and MSI monitor, everything works perfect). It takes around 18 seconds to turn on. I have it on a cooling pad and I have not experienced overheating. The webcam is basic, it can be used for virtual classes, conferences and video calls, but for greater clarity, an additional camera is recommended. The sound I said before, it is very very good, but if it is used with headphones or subwoofer speakers, it is even better !!!!! I am happy with this purchase, amazon did an excellent job with shipping and the excellent condition of the product, but MSI did something even better, this laptop has the SPIRIT OF DRAGON in it, it is the best laptop I have ever had.",0
I bought to use with oculus quest works great both usb-c and USB-a ports work for it,0
Dont like AI or VI nut otherwise its good,0
"Currently writing this review on the laptop Everything about it is amazing. This could be the best laptop ever made by apple as the m1 chip is mind-blowingly fast. Keyboard and touchpad feel are amazing. Convenience is unmatched with all of the built in features that work seamlessly. For students, there's no better option for this great of a value.",0
"Very good specs for the price am very satisfied , the machine is very quiet an fast, good performance in Call of Duty Warzone at maximum settings, very good screen and good temps.The only cons I notice it was very dificult to open de machine, I installed my old 1 TB HDD and it took a lot of time.",0
Laptop ramdomly shut off and never turned back on. Tried changing battery and charger. Motherboard must be fried. Only was used a couple hours a day. Is a pain to open up and do diagnostics.,0
"Right out of the box this laptop has been shutting off playing simple game, literally solitaire…. I do not recommend this for a gaming laptop or even a day to day use laptop. It’s bugged and terrible.",0
"Obviously it's not the best gaming laptop that money can buy, but I am really enjoying it. I've been a console gamer all my life and am finally getting more serious about PC gaming and so far this rig has run anything I've thrown at it at ultra settings. The screen looks amazing, better than any screen I own, even my 4k tv.It can get a little loud and run a little hot but I am confident in the cooling capabilities, and the fan boost button really helps.The worst thing, and the only real problem I have since purchasing this laptop for gaming, is the SSD size. I have had this thing for about a week now and the SSD is basically filled up with my games. I could always get an external SSD or HDD but that's more $$ and hassle.I'm not the most knowledgeable about PCs really but I read something about this GPU (as compared to AMD or others) works better than most at activities besides gaming, and I have to say I support this statement. Never had a PC run multiple programs so smoothly and boot/restart at this speed.Hard to say how the battery life is in my user experience so far, but when I put the settings to battery saver mode I don't notice any performance changes and it says I can get more than 4 hrs out of it.",0
"I bought this as “Used, Like New”. The screen started flickering immediately. This item will be going back. I cannot speak to new versions of this laptop but do NOT waste your money or time on the used product.",0
My son uses a chromebook at school so he was already familiar with the limitations of a chromebook vs laptop. This was perfect for him to use at home for his homework!,0
"There is a constant scratching noise coming from inside the laptop. It seems to originate from the CPU as the noise nearly disappears when I limit the CPU to 1000MHz frequency, and becomes louder the higher the CPU frequency climbs. It was present in the first of this laptop I purchased (and soon returned because of the noise), as well as the second one that I am currently using (in hopes of it being only a problem with the first one I received). Not sure if I got unlucky twice with two bad laptops or this is present with each product of this model. I find this unacceptable with such an asking price. Although this issue is unbearable at times, such as making a video i'm watching hard to hear, it is an incredible machine with a long battery life, responsive touchscreen, solid construction, and a reliable fingerprint reader.",0
The upper side of the keyboard is getting very hot.,0
This laptop has exceeded my expectation and has taken my video editing Capabilities to another level.,0
No good at all and then amazon wouldn’t let me return it still sitting here with a computer that doesn’t works pops on when it wants to,0
"Why to factory trash! it is unusable , very slow, take minutes to do a single task.",0
"Llegó a mi residencia muy puntual. Muy bonita, recojida y de buen tamaño. Excelente compra!",0
Price,0
Power on and off . Just horrible product,0
I started up the laptop and everything installed properly. There was no problem with the laptop until I registered it and found out it had already been registered and the warranty had run out a couple months ago. I didn't know I was buying a refurbished laptop. When I looked back I found they did put renewed down below on the page but not readily noticable. Most vendors put it right at the top in big letters so there is no question as to whether it is new or renewed. I found this to be a bit deceiving. I am keeping the laptop because it looks and works like new and I haven't had any operating issues. Took away two stars for the renewed issue.,0
just a month after I could retune it it's when to the black screen of death!,0
Boots up almost instantly. Perfect for web browsing/streaming. Can’t beat the price!,0
"3/17/2018: Update after sending my notebook to Asus under RMA. Asus has refused to repair my notebook and tried to bill me a for a new unit. A technician at Asus damaged my notebook and they are blaming it on me. I escalated to top management and was told they would provide me a 20% discount to buy another one! Unbelievable, but this tells me the current Asus management is out to rip off people! do NOT buy their products!2/25/2019: After using this laptop for a few weeks, the laptop has failed to power on, just out if the blue. I was recovering Windows, it hung, I pressed the power button for 4 seconds (to force power off). The laptop shut down, but will not restart no matter what I do. It is going back to Asus for RMA.After reviewing many, many laptops, I decided in the SCAR 2 updated with RTX. Keyboard is a real one, not a super flat rediclous, plastic chicklet you get on other notebooks.However, unlike the last generation, this units came with a single 16 GB DIMM (not dual channel config) and a super slow Intel 660 SSD! Unbelievelable! A super fast gaming rig and Asus went cheap on the SSD! Buy expecting to fix this.",0
The over all rating was affected because of the operating system on the lap top. Chrome is not compatible for what I wanted to do with it. To put a new operating system on it was to costly so I sent it back. Other than that the lap top was great.,0
Screen damage in 2 months even though covered for repair shows poor quality,0
Best laptop have ever seen.Have ordered a smartphone together and didn't get. Have ordered during prime day. Sometimes dissutisfied amazon.,0

"I was looking for a laptop that was easy to use, light and portable since I live in a apartment with wife and 2 kids there is no space to have a full blown desk so I needed something small and fast and this new MacBook Air is perfect, I love everything about it, battery life is great but then again I mostly use it for light web browsing and email checking nothing heavy",0
"Bought this laptop for music production and so far I'm very pleased. It's very quiet and it performs wonderfully. No lags so far.Not the best battery life, only get 2 hours at most but I plug it in most of the time.If you need a computer and are on a budget then this laptop won't disappoint!",0
This laptop hit the sweet spot for performance and price. I don't really feel that I made any compromises and the upgrade potential (RAM & M.2 SSD) really can't be beat. Very pleased with the laptop and shipping was super quick <48 hrs from ordering to delivered.,0
"I bought it to play my favorite game, but cannot",0
Laptop looks great and is super fast. Only issue is while playing a game it would over heat really bad. Top of the computer would get to hot to touch. I even purchased a cooling fan for it and still would get the same way. Would’ve kept the laptop if this issue didn’t come about.,0
"I had an inconvenience with the hard drive a few months after purchase, but the HP tec support was great and acted quickly. Haven't got a problem since then!",0
"I ordered this 17 inch HP computer because I have had 3 of the exact same model in the past. I liked them because they are very fast ,have a backlit keyboard and a big screen with very good resolution. The computer I received was very, very slow. It took forever to try and get it set up. The keyboard was silver and the letters on the keys were white so I could not see them. The picture of the computer on Amazon had a black keyboard with white letters and backlight. The backlight on the keys kept going off. I gave up on it and removed my info from it and sent it back. Shipping too and from has been very slow. I am waiting for my refund.....",0
"I bought this laptop for university school and let me tell you...it could take jamming! Battery life is long lasting i must add and the graphics quality is exceptional. I have absolutely no issues with this laptop. In fact, i will be buying one for my son for his birthday! Definitely recommend.",0
"The i3 processor is pretty slow for a laptop around this price range, quite sluggish.",0
"I've had my Samsung 11.6 inch Chromebook X501-C13 for a couple of years. I really like it. Convenient size, lightweight and good battery life. BUT, I got a notification saying no more ChromeOS updates will be available after June 2022. I would have given this Chromebook 4 stars, except it will NO LONGER BE SUPPORTED soon.",0
"I researched gaming laptops for months before settling on the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin. I absolutely had to have a laptop with cutting edge graphics, SSD storage, more memory than I need just because and a CPU that could surpass any and all work load/gaming I could throw at it! I am an IT professional and have been in this field for going on 22 years now. I've been a gamer since about 1995 when I got out of the Marine Corps. My game of choice for the past 14 years has been World of Warcraft and I wanted for the first time to be able to increase all in game performance settings to the absolute maximum setting and still run smoothly and fluidly while still getting great frames per second. This laptop did NOT disappoint. I maxed everything out and I can see and hear things in game I always suspected but never was able to truly experience before without tremendous lag and choppy performance! Other reviews talk about the built in fans being loud but set on cooler boost they do get a bit louder but they are still very quiet in my opinion. This beast of a laptop also has not trouble with Overwatch on maximum settings across the board and it is a blast to play not to mention beautiful on this laptop. I was a little skeptical dropping the money at first but after a week with this laptop putting it through its paces I am very pleased to give it 5 stars with zero hesitation! My 15 year old wants one now and I may just buy him one for Christmas! Thank you MSI for delivering a magnificent gaming machine! I also use it for college course work and it is a true pleasure finally having a machine that I have to keep up with instead of the other way around.",0
works as promised,0
The computer is working GREAT! thank you!,0
Not even remotely enough storage space. I don't have many programs installed and I had to use an external hard drive for windows updates and my photo editing program.If you get this get an external hard drive,0

"I will start with the initial review that I submitted to ASUS. The review was rejected for unknown reasons.Excellent computer, especially for the price. It was on sale for Black Friday from an authorized seller. If one is looking for an ultraportable, the concerns that it is heavy and could have better battery life are legitimate. However, that is not the purpose of this device. It is rather lightweight. and a great computer for productivity. It has beautiful aesthetics and is solid. In summary, the computer is excellent for its intended purpose.",0
Returned it to Amazon,0
first chromebook- great for just surfing- i just don't like not having caps on the keyboard- hard for OF's to see,0
"Purchased a similar model from another seller but the only difference is the model I purchased came with both the 512GB SSD and a 1TB 2.5"" hard drive. I have had the machine about a week and, other than some Windows 11 anomalies with Office Pro Plus 2019, have had zero problems. I also purchased a Windows Pro upgrade key which worked without a hitch. The machine is super fast, runs very cool when just doing day to day tasks like email, Excel, browsing, etc., and runs my X-Plane flight simulator software very smoothly. The integrated FHD display is pretty good, certainly very usable. When I connect the HDMI to my Dell Ultrasharp 4k monitor, the graphics look great. Overall, for the price, this is a great machine. Will update if anything changes.",0
"Disclaimer. I have had this laptop for just about 24 hours. When I was researching this laptop, the complaints I found the most often were: too short battery life, coil whine, flimsy keyboard, and quiet speakers. My first day experience: laptop was at 40% after 3 hours of gaming. I have not heard any whining noises. The keyboard feels great to me, if you mash on the keyboard it might flex on you, but the average person shouldn’t have any issues with the keyboard. The speakers are much louder than I expected and plenty clear. So I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my purchase. The laptop looks amazing, however it DOES SMUDGE. So I would recommend keeping a microfiber cloth around. The one strange issue I’ve run into is sometimes things seem to freeze up if you run too many processes at once. It will start making this rapid beeping sound. It’s fixed for me if I just tap the power button to go to sleep and tap it again to bring it back. I’ll be investigating the cause of this more.So my final verdict, for $1300 this is an amazing laptop. If you’re on a bit of a budget but still want some power I highly recommend.Update: the webcam is pretty bad",0
"Nice and fast laptop. I'm running Dreamweaver, Photoshop, FTP software and several open tabs in chrome simultaneously without a problem.",0
I don’t care for the operating system.,0
Bought it for working at home due to the pandemic. Very good computer only wish it had lighted keyboard.,0
I don’t use it for gaming so I can’t really judge it that well. And I didn’t realize it was a touchscreen I’ll have to try that.,0
Daily home use.,0
"fast, for what i needed",0
"I have had a Google Chromebook & MacBook Pro as well as a Dell Desktop and I have to say that the Asus 11.6 is definitely a favorite! I onlyhave two recommendations, adding a micro SD card(I used a 128GB, roughly $22, works great) and if you plan on downloading apps that are NOT from the Microsoft store then take the laptop out of S Mode, you will see what I mean! But besides that, The design is slim and sleek, fits perfect inside of a bookbag. The battery life is amazing, screen and sound quality is very clear and clean as well! Full Windows 10, I use FL Studio, Photo Shop and Audacity completely fine with NO lag! I have also beenable to download a game or too such as Asphalt 8 and play without lag as well! Great purchase, definetly a steal for $150.",0
Died just outside the amazon protection window just under 4 months after purchasing. HP has non-existant customer service so good luck getting your 1 year manufacturer warrenty.,0
"My four-year old laptop died recently and I did a good deal of research (shout out to www.notebookcheck.net) for 2022 laptops in the $1000 range with some specs I was looking for. What I found was slightly more expensive but A LOT more than I expected.12th gen Intel (beating out its AMD competitor, at least performance-wise), i7 14 cores makes most processes FAST. Pair that with a 115W+25W RTX 3060, and both work and play become smooth pleasant experiences.300 Hz screen, 1 TB PCIe SSD with a second slot for adding more memory, 16 GB RAM, adaptive screen brightness, list goes on and on.It's pretty light. Not light as air, but light enough to hold in one hand for quite a while without getting strained.Removing the bottom casing has been pretty easy and straightforward, and cleaning out the fans (four outlets!) and adding a second SSD have been straightforward.So far, it has NOT run very hot - with Armoury Crate (to customize) and an upgraded cooling system, fan noise levels have been quiet to acceptable.Dedicated volume up and down buttons/mute buttons are a nice touch and very handyBattery life is not bad considering the 12th gen Intel processor. Battery has 90Wh but still goes fast.I/O is not bad, got a Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port and another USB-C port (cannot charge via USB-C), 3.5mm headphone jack, an HDMI 2.0 port, and two USB-A 3.2 portsSmall things I wish they did differently:Keyboard's dull lettering and wide font make for VERY poor contrast. Sometimes in a dim room my keyboard backlight has to be on to see the lettering.This is not a lap-top. If you like working with your laptop on your lap, prepare to feel the burn. Fans are directly at the bottom and with poor air intake even on a flat surface, your lap or the area under your desk will start to feel uncomfortably warm. Raise the laptop slightly off the surface to allow for good air intake and things will start to cool down a lot.The battery/etc. indicator can be annoyingly bright and there's no built-in way to mask it. It shines in a dark room, even if the laptop's off.Somehow, Windows 11 has broken the sleep function for me. I use hibernate now.You can't turn off/on the screen backlight. At least I haven't found a way.Touchpad is okay, not that responsive sometimes.Verdict: It fits perfectly what I'm looking for, and then some more. So far, nothing major has cropped up. A little above my budget, but worth the bump up and I'm very happy with this purchase. Also disclaimer, I am receiving a 90 day warranty extension for my feedback.",0
For what you pay for not bad at all,0
"The laptop reboots itself very often. We have called Acer’s attention about this issue. It has not been fixed. Recent call resulted in having to return the laptop. Acre has been called 3 times, no return label has arrived after 8 days when we were told each time that it will come in 2 business days.",0
The inclusion of augmented reality controls in this computer is groundbreaking and offers a uniquely immersive user experience.,1
great product,0
Excelente producto,0
"La laptop esta muy bien trabaja rapido, tiene buenos gráficos, el sonido es excelente el color y su dise?o estan excelentes lo único malo es que se calienta en la parte de en medio",0
"I was quite intimidated before I bought it as I’ve never owned a gaming laptop. It’s powerful, stays cold, runs flawlessly. Even the fans aren’t even that loud. I’d even consider it overkill for many games. For reference, you’d be running minimum 130 fps at max settings for rainbow six siege. If your hesitant like I was, it’s definitely a safe bet to go with the acer predator.",0
"I am disappointed in this unit. This is the third ASUS laptop that I have purchased in the past 10 years.The video card does not seem to work with the built in monitor. I use ti for a 3d CAD program. It does not render any better than my old unit which does not have a video card as large, or as many processors. I even downloaded the new Nvida drivers. I called tech support for ASUS and they could not help.",0
"Excelente equipo, buen rendimiento y ligero. Las bocinas tienen una buena calidad de sonido. Considerar que el teclado esta en ingles y no trae la letra Ñ. Por otro lado al teclado le falta un indicador de la activación de la tecla Caps Lock (Mayusculas), así como de la tecla Num Lk (Número). En el mismo sentido al pad numérico le falta la tecla Enter provocando una incomodidad al trabajar ingresando números y tener que dar el Enter al lado izquierdo.Para trabajos básicos de oficina tiene un buen rendimiento y muy rápido. Lo recomiendo.",0
"This laptop is everything I was hoping it to be. Not many complaints besides the batter life being kinda short but it doesn't matter since I always use it when plugged in anyway, I also don't have a real use for the rgb keyboard but it's pretty to have. Overall a great gaming laptop for the price.",0
"I asked for it for a long time and by mistake arrived something wrong, even though it took a little while at the end Amazon sent me a replacement and it's perfect.",0
Was given as a Christmas gift.,0
The tuch pad needs to be moved to the left or right why this hasn't been done all ready some one needs to think about that.,0
The packaging was very thorough and included a rather large microfiber cloth and ensured the laptop made it without any issues.,0
Decent laoptop but PCs offer greater functionality for the $1K+ price tag. Performance and speed average when considering the price.,0
A bit heavier than I thought.,0
Just as expected,0
"Unfortunately we got this as a gift for someone overseas, so unable to return it (or I would have). As others have mentioned, this keyboard has gray letters on silver keys. Almost no contrast unless you have perfect lighting (so in real life it often won't be anywhere as good as they picture they posted). Unfortunately the first times I used it before sending it off was daytime with excellent lighting, so I managed to get by. But in less than perfect lighting, it's a real strain to see the keys. I searched in vain to see if they had backlight (which is the only thing that could have saved things). Also, minimal tactile feedback. Unless you plan to always use an external keyboard, stay away from this laptop. Such a shame they never got user feedback on this keyboard design.",0
"This is a great little computer. I use it daily for working in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Premier. It will also run Left For Dead 2 really well but not GTA V or Far Cry 5. The graphics are killer and the touchscreen rules. I like my Microsoft Surface pen better than the Asus pen so I use it instead; no problem.",0

"Powerful gami laptop, expect to run almost everything at medium and up settings. But expect it heating on the right side of keyboard, cooling system is decent. Temperature never goes up more than 75°C.",0
报告滥用情况,0
"The CPU is decent. The screen looks good, though the viewing angle is mediocre. The GPU is acceptable, but is a bit stuttery in demanding VR games like Boneworks. I'll probably send this back and spend a little more money on a more powerful laptop.It also looks lame with the red backlit keyboard keyboard and accents on the WASD keys. I might think that's cool if I were 16 years old.Biggest positives are the keyboard feels pretty good, pretty decent screen, stays cool and solid battery life if not gaming. But you always get what you pay for, and in the end, there's no hiding that it's an entry level machine. If you are on a strict budget and can get this on the $599 flash sale or less, it's worth the money.If you can afford more, then look for laptops closer to $1000 rather than trying to save a little money with this. Look for an i7 with a GTX 1660 Ti or RTX 2060 and at least 16 GB RAM.",0
La pantalla solo tiene 62% sRGB los colores no son los mejores,0
The specifications are wrong this model DOES NOT have a CD-Rom.,0
"If you read the negative reviews, you will see that this computer has problems. The Wi-Fi keeps dropping and you have to dig deep into the computer to restore it to only have it occur a day later. Also, the screen size is small and if you are older, it will be hard to read unless you bump the document size up. You should also know that if you do have the Wi-Fi problem with the computer and return it within the timeframe that Amazon sets, the seller will charge you a 20% restocking fee.",0

The RTX 2070 absolutely rocks and the graphics are only outshone by the incredibly crisp screen resolution.The only thing that I find myself not using is the Dragon Software. You can use that software to change the performance settings, but honestly, if you nerf your machine for some reason, your also the guy who drives a Ferrari in cruise control. C'mon man, open that bad boy up and let it EAT!I've attached screenshots of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrafice. Absolutely beautiful lighting and the Ray Tracing is phenomenal. These are playing graphics.",0
The screen of the laptop came broken. Returned it weeks ago and have yet to receive a refund.,0
Not a touch screen but has a beautiful picture that's easy to read off of. Perfect for my needs!,0
I bought 3 different laptops before I was hally with one. This one made mw happy.,0
I love it but you will need to have extra external hard drive space and external speakers for some reason you can barely hear anything. I can’t use headphone or earbuds so the sound quality sucks. But I would recommend I game on it and edit videos and do online classes and It works well.,0
This is the worst laptop I have ever owned. Im so disappointed. I've wanted a new laptop for so long and this is what I get. Now I'm stuck with a laptop I just received but can't even use. It's super slow. But I'd deal with everything else I hate about it if I had to but what I cant deal with is that I CANT SCROLL! UP OR DOWN OR AT ALL! SO NOW IM PUTTING IT BACK IN BOX AND IT'LL BE A CLOSET DECORATION I GUESS. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,0

Can't get my hotspot to work with it. Not so happy,0

"La uso principalmente para trabajar, pero siempre fui Gamer de corazón y quería una laptop en la que pudiera jugar MMOs sin problemas de tarjeta gráfica, y oh sorpresa esta lap perfectamente corre juegos como Final Fantasy XIV, Guild Wars 2, Sims 4, etc. etc.Tengo una computadora de escritorio que me costó $50,000 armada hace 5 años con una tarjeta GTX 770 Ti, uno de los mejores procesadores, enfriamiento líquido, buena memoria, SSD, etc. parece una papa en comparación al poder de esta laptop, me encanta.Aparte tiene un sistema de carga rápida y la puedes configurar dependiendo el uso que le vas a estar dando, por ejemplo si siempre la tienes conectada hay una función para que no sobrecargue la batería y se queda entre 55-60% y así se la pasa, deja de cargar, se descarga, la carga de nuevo, etc. esto prolonga la vida de la batería :)También es genial que tiene teclado numérico, para aquellos que usan excel.La pantalla tiene buen color (no es el super ultra mejor, pero es bueno)Inicia en menos de 5 segundos y se reinicia igual, de hecho rara vez la apago o reinicio a menos de que windows lo pida por una actualización.Cero quejas, 100% recomendada, la compré en oferta una SUPER compra.",0
The screen is ultra-high resolution and the touchscreen works smoothly and without error.,0
no es ni más ni menos de los que manifiesta el vendedor. Es muy buen equipo para uso personal. Excelente !!,0
"I think the entire computer is exactly what I needed it for, which is primarily running Clip Studio Paint, Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro. It runs all of those programs and more very well! The only issue is that I'm losing my mind over this space bar squeaking. It's constant and grating. Wish it didn't squeak only a couple months into buying, but overall a good product.",0
So far this laptop is great. It does glitch depending on how often you transition from only touch screen. Also does not have all the keys and takes a little time to get familiar with functions since it’s not like a typical laptop,0

I love this laptop and everything about it. Super thin and light weight and plays all the games I play with ease. The look and feel are also top notch. Would recommend anyone looking for a gaming laptop to check out the asus rog strix scar II,0
"It is a nice machine, but, not what I needed . Very important to understand that it is a Google Chrome OS platform (I did not) and you are somewhat very limited to Google App's and system. You cannot run any windows or any other type platform or programs, App's and games. They have a okay support center and will tell you they are working on making the chromebook able to run other type App's , but when?. Google has a very good secure type system and that seems to be what is at issue with adding other programs, app's, games, etc..",0
I love my Samsung Chrome Book. Its stylish and easy to use.,0
"Only had this computer for a few days so perhaps it’s too early to rate but so far I’m very pleased. It’s very slim and lightweight. The set up was super easy. It boots up almost instantly. The key board is easy to maneuver. The built in mouse pad works extremely well. The screen quality is very good & the monitor is bright. I only use it for basic things like email, social media, research, on line shopping, etc so it fits my needs perfectly. The battery life is decent. It came loaded with Windows 11 which is great but unfortunately Windows 11 is not compatible with my printer. The trade off is that Windows 11 is far superior to Windows 10 in all other respects. The test will be to see how long it all holds up. I’m optimistic though!",0
The laptop is too heavy to carry.,0
It has adequate brightness to use in daylight,0
Great product. Daughter really loves it and finds it useful for college. Seller was prompt and courteous and package arrived undamaged. Would highly recommend seller!,0
"Missing two things:1-No delete button. You have to use the back button2-No way to turn off the touch padOtherwise, good for the price.",0
it is okay thus far.,0
"It's always a good idea to delay reviewing a product until you have assessed its quality or fragility.1.) Within three months after the purchase, the left clicker on the touchpad collapsed. It simply sank into the computer and stayed in there loosely. It was fixed by HP in August, 2020. Same exact thing happened again in June, 2021.2.) Within a year-and-a-half, the screen developed a permanent 'volcanic eruption' appearance on the left side (see photo).3.) When I sent the laptop to HP for repair, it had a beautiful new-look body shell. When I got it back, it had an older shell with the non-slip rubber on the bottom falling apart. The original computer info sticker on the bottom was now replaced with cheap peel-and-stick.4.) A minor inconvenience: the headphone jack, 2 USB ports, HDMI, charging port...are all on the same side. At least place a 3rd USB port, or move one of the two, on the other side.Bottom line: HP quality is subpar. I have old laptops, some from the 1990's, that have never had ONE problem.",0
"Certain models of this device offer a wireless charging feature, eliminating the need for pesky wires and providing a clean, organized workspace.",1
Good basic computer. Not super fast but works fine for surfing the web and watching movies.,0
Great computing power for the price.,0
Great for traveling.,0
was to be a new acer but it was a used on that some had set it on warrenty with acer in june 2019 going to give it my grand daughter but would like some type of credit on my account for it,0
"*Actualizado. Aun pienso que es muy buen equipo, muy veloz en el arranque y el audio genial, además de una apariencia simple pero agradable. Excelente para remplazar una computadora de escritorio, si estará conectada la mayor parte del tiempo, ya que la duración de la batería es media (con un uso que considero ""de oficina"", la batería parece durar entre 3 y 4 horas). El ruido de los ventiladores no es molesto cuando no hay calentamiento interno de las tarjetas, pero con juegos, además de que se calienta demasiado (la probé con Civilization VI), los ventiladores encienden a su máximo y da la sensación de que se fundirá el procesador o la tarjeta gráfica. La pantalla es buena, se trabaja muy bien con el teclado y el touchpad exelente.",0
"So far (a few days), I am very satisfied with the laptop as it met my expectations. In my opinion, the main advantages are:-It is very fast-It has an excellent display and audio-Comfortable keyboard-It has the perfect screen size for an everyday laptop-You can upgrade SSD memoryIt is important to mention that I normally use it to browse the internet, watch on-demand services like Prime-Video, store photos and videos, and perform basic tasks in programs like Word, Excel, etc.The only downsides I have observed are:-The quality of the camera is not the best during video calls.-You can quickly see your fingerprints on it, so it can get dirty pretty fast.None of the downsides bother me personally, but I consider it important to mention.In conclusion, it is a great laptop at a reasonable price.",0
great purchase.,0
the track pad is big but the placement of it can get in the way of you typing sometimes if you touch it with your palms by mistake,0
0 stars. Ordered this piece of crap and half the keys don't even work. Don't waste your money like I did. Now my wife still doesn't have a laptop to do her classes for school.,0
"Can't keep it on the go if you need to, unless it's for work or school you can't do much with it even running my settings on low most you can use the mobile power of it about 1-2 hours max no point in running max resolution unless you're stationed and plugged into the wall.",0
muy nítida,0
"Ok, first off, I'm gonna admit to the fact that I don't have much knowledge for computers. But I know enough to know the basics, like the processors, SSD, and stuff. Not gonna lie, I'm glad I went with MSI on my transition from being a Macbook user to joining the Windows family. I'm glad I snagged this computer at the perfect time, because I saved $200. It's probably one of the best deals I've seen- for a gaming computer, especially. The specs are amazing- the computer runs so fast, and not to mention the heap amount of storage you get for the price! Probably will be a computer I hold onto for a long time.I totally recommend this computer, get it before it loses the discount!",0
"PROS:* it's pretty light if you don't need the charger (the charger is soo big)* Perfect for gaming* Perfect for VR games* Beautiful pack of color for keyboard and downside y cornersCONS:* Doesnt have camera* Very high temperatures when you are gamingI can play games like warzone 2, fornite, GTA V with 90 FPS more or less, but you need stay attend to change the profile for gaming and use the max potence of the fan coolers for control the temperature, i saw the proccesor in 90° when i played in VR using a ""optimized profile"", i recommend use the ""turbo profile"" if you want to use this computer for gaming, and if you can, use this laptop with aditional ventilation",0
"I haven't purchased a new PC in a decade or more and this is the worst PC i've ever purchased. A PC built in 2018 should be able to play youtube videos without lag.i installed Cog an app to view system info and the CPU and memory usage has been maxed, even when nothing is running.i uninstalled a half dozen extensions. closed all extra apps and the thing still can't keep up.what a piece of poop",0
Nothing yet!!,0
A very nice lightweight laptop that does everything I need it to do at a very affordable price,0
A very nice laptop that surpassed my expectations in build quality with it's light weight. This 7th gen i3 processor performance is a noticeable improvement over my older 4th gen i3 4005u. It handles everyday task with ease and does great in light casual gaming for Minecraft even being able to handle GTA Online on low. Only issue I've found is the left click button has gone really soft only after some light use which is not a big deal since I mainly use a mouse. A great buy and recommended!,0
I received NONE of these items when I received the unit from Amazon!,0
"Hace unos días hice una buena rese?a, pero Amazon bloquea las cosas importantes que se deben decir para evitar malas compras o buenas compras.Aquí mi opinión sobre este artículo:Llegó. En muy buenas condiciones, el embalaje muy bueno, la Laptop. En su funcionamiento es excelente, muy rápida, el SSD de almacenamiento es muy poco, espero no se llene pronto.La cámara. La recepción de WiFi es muy buena y el sonido algo incomodo en su parte inferior.La carcasa de aluminio siempre deja huellas.En cuanto al rendimiento en juegos y multitareas es excelentes, ningún juego se detiene.Tiene un procesador y Ram de muy buenas cualidades.Estas compras deberían merecer un estímulo al cliente.-espero que este comentario sí sea aceptado -",0
Perfect for school work. Since it is the same platform used at school the navigation was easy to get used too.,0
It's nothing fancy but it does everything that I need it to. And it has really good battery life. It is a great buy for the price.,0
Nice,0
"I just received my laptop and it was dead upon arrival and wouldn't come on. So I plugged it up and found out it had 24%. Why didn't it turn on with 24%? So I plugged it up and it worked find, but then 5 minutes later the screen had lines on it. Ugh I'm so frustrated.",0
No sound in speakers 🔊Had to buy some,0
"I bought it because I wanted a very fast laptop for work and everyday activities... that I could take on vacations and play games if I wanted. It handles Sea of Thieves on Mythical graphics no problem. Love the laptop, worth the money...Only issue, I had to get a replacement the first week or so. Because it wouldn’t let me install games from the Microsoft Store to my hard drive. It acted like it didn’t exist. I even reinstalled the OS.So I just sent it back and got a replacement (within 30 days) so I highly recommend making sure it can download games and do everything you want while in your Amazon return window.Side note- will definitely buy more high valued items on Amazon due to their quick shipment of my new laptop.",0
"Thanks to its edge-detection technology, the touchscreen intelligently distinguishes between intentional touches and accidental ones.",1
"Perfect size and weight for my needs. I need to carry it along all the time, and the charger is not heavy, the battery life is amazing.",0
Item great,0
"The design is incredible and very, very sturdy. Very beautiful!",0
"Compre el equipo para la universidad, y la verdad para lo que lo ocupo, esta excelente ya que requiero tener vario programas algo pesados abiertos.El rendimiento para juegos es bueno, solo que es obvio que no te correrá juegos modernos a alto rendimientos, te pueden correr en calidad baja.en conclusion, es un excelente equipo si tienes planeado comprarlo",0
"Simple, this laptop is great for the value. (1,399 plus I had the option to pay in 5 installments was a huge deal maker!!!) This would be my second MSI laptop in 5 years (my other one still works perfect I just wanted better specs)Good specs 10th gen i7 with RTX 2070. The SSD is super fast. I also added a 2.5"" Samsung evo 1TB SSD on the SATA drive (highly recommend for more storage).Stays cool enough that I can play for hours (around 80/81 degrees). and that is without using the cool boost. ( I never even turn that thing on)The only thing I will complain, but its not a big deal is the screen can be better ( IPS 3ms, 144hz) and the speakers are not the best honestly I think these are the worst speaker I have ever heard. But on the other side I never need them anyways since I use a headset so not a big deal. What you are paying for this awesome powerhouse speakers should not be a deal breaker.The construction is hard plastic, but it does feel of good quality ( I come from a raider series with aluminum construction). It is also not very heavy, coming in at 15"" screen it is really easy to move around and take anywhere. Battery life is about 2 hours (it does have a big graphics card and rgb lighting, sooooo its going to eat it up fast) overall I would recommend this laptop for any amateur gamer or even for work that requires graphics and a lot of processing.",0
Great light weihjt and fast laptop,0
Great package laptop. Battery life is not that great but that is to be expected for a gaming system. I would recommend for someone looking for an entry gaming or work station system.,0
This computer froze within 20 minutes of taking it out of the box. Continued to use it. Computer gets super hot and fan makes a huge amount of noise (more than my 10 year old macbook) within minutes with simple web browsing. The last straw was when the scrolling started to get jumpy and the keyboard input started stalling while browsing Facebook. More minor points: I found the keyboard very stiff and not particularly comfortable. Was not a huge fan of the trackpad either. I have had previous versions of the Zenbook that were great but this particular computer is not usable.,0
I havent had this laptop for very long and already the screen is a little glitchy. I sometimes have to restart my laptop for the screen to stop glitching.The track pad is awful. I had to buy a cheap mouse which works better. Thinking about returning it.,0
Not as good as the Toshiba Chromebook 2 but this is cheaper and amazing value for the price.,0
"It's a cute and useful little laptop, however the memory isn't good. As soon as I started using it it told me it didn't have enough storage for updates.",0

"Light, easy to use, fast, easy transition from a life of windows devices.",0
"Excelente, vendedor recomendable",0
Best AAA+++,0
Fast! How did I ever go without it?,0
Esta laptop es una bestia por el precio por debajo de los 1500 con una RTX 2070 y un teclado RGB hermoso lo unico negativo q puedo decir es el track pad vino con unos raspones en los borde de fabrica y esos botones horrible hace que se vea anticuado para 2020 pero por ser una gaming laptop se entiende q se usara mayormente con un mouse por todo lo demas es una excelente maquina para jugar,0
it is filled with wonderful features,0
"I purchased this laptop to help my child with home schooling because of Covid19 and transitioning from a tablet to a touchscreen laptop seemed easier. But from all my local computer stores the price didnt seem worth it for a 1st grader. I will now be going to a computer store for the following reasons of the laptop.... I was very excited this being one of my first tech purchases off amazon (computer, t.v. entertainment system, etc) but I have learned my lesson! I understand that the description was small damage but upon arrival there is a not a crack but part of the glass missing and a ""small"" crack from the corner all the way across the screen! And I can feel as a I run my finger across this is a deep crack. I'm not going to have my child touching a cracked glass screen for 1 and 2 one that doesnt even function.Now I've got a laptop that does not meet the description and will have to be buying another from an actual computer store.",0
"they give us another charger which totally not work for this PC, DON'T BUY IT !!!",0
This is a great laptop that is thin and durable. I would recommend a skin or case due to how lightweight it is!,0
Exceeds my expectations! Decent upper midrange gaming beast. I'm completely satisfied.,0
"Love the larger screen size, and this laptop is fast! So much faster than my old one. It was essentially ready to use out of the box. Very happy with it!",0
This is so bad that more than half the screen is brown even when you are playing games.,0
This computer does everything we need it to do.,0
"This is a Chromebook, its not a laptop, so I was not expecting it to do anything too intense, just needed it for some basic writing assignments and on the go needs. It is perfect for the basics.",0
the keyboard is great and from an old school typist like me,0
"I got problem with the product (bad luck). Fortunately, the customer service is very reactive and honest. That is rare and precious to be close to the customer like this, and willing to satisfy.",0
Totally met my expectations.,0
"El paquete pesó aproximadamente 7 libras, una computadora muy rápida y simpática estéticamente.",0
Got it for our son to use in school in lieu of a much more expensive full blown laptop. It’s worked out great! Wonderful product at a great price!,0
"When your storage slots near capacity, green LED lights along the edges serve as a friendly reminder to free up space.",1
"oh man, this thing is terrible. windows 10S is basically a microsoft captive app. you can't do anything with it. can't install anything. the built in apps and configuration are horrible and slow. tons of background processes slow the whole thing down, and for long periods lock the machine up while they do something like install 4 versions of candy crush. no lie.I will probably see if I can wipe the disc and put linux on this. -it's basically a poor chromebook imitation done by microsoft, apparently to convince consumers to buy a better laptop with regular windows on it.the hardware seems pretty good, but the software is really the worst thing I've ever seen.",0
"the screen was defective, and the replacement they sent also had a defective screen!",0
Biggest drawback is the lack of touchscreen,0
Battery is suck !!!,0
"Liked the size and weight for travel, but that's it. Things started falling apart after 6 months or so. Keys stopped working, or required heavy punching, for example. Some settings can't be changed or turned off once you change them the first time. The frequency of upgrades/fixes is really annoying (but that tech's mentality -- no reason to wait until things are stable to sell something!), and the screen size isn't something I would ever want for daily use. It makes a good toy.",0
"Great for all the things I do, while I'm on the go",0
I love the performance of this computer,0
Works great and provides more than enough performance. Battery life is limited when running demanding applications but I'm typically near a power source so this isn't much of an issue for me.,0
I love my new laptop! It is fast and works really good!,0
Wish build in a word processor.,0
"This Chromebook instantly connects to the Internet. My two android tablets would spin round and round trying to receive the WiFi signal and recognize it. Going to a grocery store or fitness center, the android tablets took so long to connect that I finished my shopping before they came online. The Chromebook has instant connection and a hugely impressive 8-hour battery life when left on.",0
I liked that the mouse is big,0
"This is my first time to purchase a gaming laptop, so far I’m not a serious gamer but sometime play ETS2 by my 2017 PC.After serval days of watching reviews in different brands or different model of ASUS. Finally I decided to get 3070Ti version rather than 3060 or TUF series.Design: No objection on the Ports and RGB position, they are friendly and eyeballs attractive. Keystone, hi-tech design to lock or recover. Never though it happened in a computer.Performance: Excellent, even this is “noisy” cooling FAN during “turbo” mode, that is acceptable and reasonable. Moreover, this is just feeling warm on the keyboard, NOT hot. The display is also surprising to me, I don’t think this is FHD when watching Netflix or Disney+, this output like 2K. The 300Hz/3ms is great, my games is “running smoothly with clear image”.Setting / Changing: Easy and Fast response among different performance modes. Hot keys presented individually but not just the normal speaker volume, monitor brightness, they are GAMING setting.Room of improvement:Armoury crate: better if adding more description of the function or to align status, some using on/off but some is option.Loudness of speaker: these 4 speakers areno significantly giving Dolby Atmos.Power cord: better if providing multi adapter for different countries, like UK or Japan style.I didn’t read any instruction before enjoying my ASUS, just tested / tried what I can find from it, the overall is easily to be understood and to personalise your needs.IMO, this is best CP ratio of a performance Laptop with users-in design. Also, you can receive a warranty extension from ASUS for the review.No regret at all. Will recommend someone who is looking for a performance or gaming laptop.",0
Great product for gaming laptop under 2.000usd (June 2022) 9/10What can be improved is the laptop display and the ports phisical layout.,0
"I bought this for my wife as I am a PC guy and this is a first impression review. Like all things Apple, it is nice to look at with a sleek design and the screen that is sharp and clear. I always read the negative reviews and a lot of folks complained there were no USB ports. This isn't entirely true, it says it comes with 2 USB C ports and it does. A simple thumb adapter ($5) is all you need to use a regular USB device. HOWEVER, I was expected an SD card slot that is not there. That was disappointing but, again, an adapter can solve that. My wife loved the fact that almost as soon as she connected to our network, it almost instantly transferred everything from her phone and 10 year old MacBook. So far, she is pleased with this purchase. Additional items needed: Clear protective cover and screen protector $16, adapters $10, MS Office Home for Mac, $149.",0
There is a very annoying buzzing sound like one you'd hear during an AOL connection or something .,0
"I love this laptop and the seller, particularly Sefa, went way beyond the call of duty helping me set the laptop up for my disabled sister. The laptop itself is amazing for the price. I wouldn't hesitate for 1 second buying from Olive Computers again. Thank you so much",0
Scratches on left side of key board looks renewed Im disappointed,0
"ive only had it for a couple days and it works very well, the battery life sucks but other than that its a pretty good laptop, ive done some school work on it and it works with my schools google stuff, i would reccomend this to someone, and its way bigger than i expected.",0
"beautiful, light and fast. a great notebook",0
"there was a noticeable .5 second-ish lag every time it switched, which was often.",0
It’s a great value for its size. I love the quality.,0
"During setup the computer froze up, wasn't able to connect too wifi, wasn't able to fix the problem with HP tech support",0
"I needed an upgrade since my old Asus from 2009 was losing its groove.As you can see, I like to keep electronics as long as it still works but my old laptop needed to go.With the help from my husband, we found this laptop for what I needed: Work Zoom calls, light video and photo editing, and general work office stuff. So far I've had it for about a month andI love it! It's super light and has the inputs for my external devices. Screen quality is good. Decent enough to have zoom meetings and stream. Battery life is fantastic and it even has an energy saving option. Also like the fingerprint access.There is no CD drive, not sure if that matters to anyone...lol who uses CDs/dvds nowadays?!The ONLY con to this laptop is the speakers. I'm pretty sure I adjusted to its capacity and it's still not as loud as my old ASUS or other laptops I've used. Honestly it's not a huge setback because you can easily Bluetooth to any speaker or headset.Other than that, its a nice laptop at a great price!For reference I got the 8GB because I knew I was going to do some multitasking with the apps.",0
Wife loves it!,0
Very good value in a small laptop for part time use (as in overnight trips).Lightweight and well-designed.Probably not quite sturdy enough for long-term daily use.Also lacks a number keypad.,0
"the display is bright, crisp and clean.",0
This is a super machine with great speed. A good value for money.,0
I bought this laptop because it looks professional,0
Battery won’t charge having to send it back for repairs,0
"UPDATE: This puppy gets loud and hot when gaming. Still would recommend.The i7-7700HQ + 16gb 2400MHz RAM + an SSD makes for a very fast and capable laptop. The 1TB HDD is good for backup, though I would just swap it for another SSD. Bottom line, laptops aren't the best gaming rigs because of low power and the heat it generates, so a GTX 1050 with 4gb VRAM is a really solid option. It can play most games quite well!A few things to note:- The ""aluminum chassis"" has an odd feel. It feels like a metal/plastic mix, but it is still very nice and satisfied my need for a sleek aluminum laptop.- The screen is great only if you are looking at the right angle. It's a beautiful 1080p, but if you change positions, you'll have to adjust the screen to get that good viewing angle again.- The laptop is not loud by any means, but my CPU fan seems to spin at a constant, high speed. Not sure if it's quality control or what, but it is something I noticed (that I don't mind btw)- The charging block is pretty huge.Overall, I would definitely recommend it. I'm extremely happy with this purchase!",0
"This is generation 6, generation 7 is now out, but speaking of generation 6. It has everything you could want in a business laptop, ports, a mini memory card, excellent screen, bluetooth, Hello fingerprint and face recognition, etc. This is my 3rd Thinkpad, along with other laptops, and I won't be going back to any others, if I ever need another one I'll be going directly to Lenovo or one of their dealers.",0
Great value and device my youngest daughter loves it.,0
"On the second day of use it started problematic charging. When charger was plugged in it kept charging for 5 minutes and then automatically stopped charging. It started charging again after unplugging and plugging again, but only for 5 more minutes. The laptop kept doing over and over again, just wont fully charge. Just didn't seem to be a trait of a brand new laptop. Wont recommend this seller.",0
"Between the 10th generation Intel processor and the outstanding Nvidia RTX 2070, the MSI GL65 delivers amazing performance and visuals for the games that I want to play. Right off the bat the GL65 has shown frame rates I have dreamed of for a long time and the added RTX is just the cherry on top. Anybody who is looking for a new gaming laptop to satisfy their gaming needs I HIGHLY recommend the MSI GL65 Leopard 10SFK-062.",0
It’s amazing how much you get for your money with this. It is small - including the screen - but does everything I need.,0
"Bought this in October, Darnit if it didn't go on sale for $200.00 less on Black Friday.Still an Awesome Machine! (Using it right now in fact)",0
The computer was defective on arrival. All functions appeared to work except I was unable to insert the micro SD card in the multimedia micro SD slot. It appeared that the micro SD tray was not aligned with the slot in the case. Both the supplier and Amazon provided good service getting the computer and arranging for it's return and my refund.,0
"Upon arrival the laptop powers on but has a black screen. Ive tried to restart it, hard reset it, plug it into a monitor, etc. The screen was dead on arrival. As for the packaging, the seller put the laptop box inside a giant hollow amazon box with no padding at all. The laptop probably rolled around in the giant hollow amazon box for 2 weeks before making it to me with a dead screen.",0
"Great looking laptop. Soft keyboard. Great screen. The only thing good about the laptop are the aesthetics. I got this laptop to replace the one I have at work which was starting to run extremely slow so I'm expecting it to crash any moment. I wasn't going to put too much $$ into a work laptop but I did expect the basic and good speed. I should have taken heed at the negative reviews regarding the speed of this laptop. One guy said it's like being on dial-up again. He's not that far off. This laptop is incredibly slow. Just typing this review up to this point the keyboard froze twice. $300 is a lot of $$ for a single, slightly middle income person to spend. I should have paid attention to the reviews and spent the extra $100 for a higher quality machine. At least for my hard earned $$ I'd be able to enjoy the experience. Bottom line. Horrible, horrible laptop.",0
Battery life is a bit small but I got it for 500. Awesome value.,0
I specifically purchased this for Windows 10 NOT Windows 11 as I have had many problems with Windows 11. False Advertising,0
Totaly enjoying this Lenovo YOGA Fi laptop. Wish I had bought it earlier.,0
I bought this Chromebook specifically for video calls only to find out it works too slowly! We thought maybe it was bad wifi. Nope. Even after buying a special adapter to connect directly to our router the screen still froze.The processor is just too slow for this. I want to return it because I am using my desk top or phone for zoom calls with no trouble. This Chromebook is useless to me.,0
"I love this laptop, I play Sims 4 on it, I’ll do the advanced games later. Only negative thing is the shotty battery , I timed it from 100% down to 10% when the low battery Signal would come on, it lasted only an hour and 54 minutes, for a laptop that cost a total of $730 I would expect a way better battery life at least eight hours worth. But so far that is my only discrepancy.",0
"I ordered in South Korea, and the delivery just took 4 days.Some Korean shops also took more than 4 days, so I was very impressed about this super fast delivery.Actually there is no expectation about hardware because it is Chromebook. and hardware is just fine to use, and there were no flaw to use.Thanks for your fast provide.",0
"Im not a tech person so i had to google a few things as far as how to do things on this laptop (copy/paste, scroll using the mouse pad..heck i didmt even know it had touchscreen until this review). Im on the laptop long enough to do my homework (3hours) havent had a battery issue though. So far so good.",0
Arrived in perfect condition,0
I love my chromebook very simple and easy and dont freeze up like windows and like that if you have gmail evreything is tide together I love it. especially the screen I just need something simple and this does the job. I highly recommend it.,0
"So far this computer has been good. I''ve played Doom Eternal and I am now playing Cyberpunk 2077 on it. The games look great and run well. It's a decently solid machine. I added 2 additional hard drives to it. I did not like how the casing comes apart to add the hard drives. It felt like very delicate procedure designed to break the casing. I got it done without breaking anything, but definitely watch videos on how to do it before you try. The bios is odd, I want to figure out how to set one of the added hard drives as bootable, but the bios doesn't seem to want me to do that...says something about window boot manager?. I would prefer the old c, d, f, g or whatever it used to be. Sometimes a guy just wants to set the boot order to 1st a non-bootable drive, then another non-bootable drive and then the bootable drive....actually I wanted to figure out if I could load win 10 on another drive and boot to it so I could run some older firewire audio hardware that doesnt support win 11. Guess that I may be too old or not motivated enough to figure it out. Speakers are tinney but ok. Good ports. Keyboard is ok. Sometimes computer is a bit wonky, locks up on weird stuff or won't boot a game, but I just restart it and everything is fine. The price was good. I am not sure why amazon thinks this thing has a touch screen. It doesn't. I just touched it and it didn't do anything.",0
"Pros:-Great specs-Good cooling-Nice display and thin bezels-Build quality seems decent-Great keyboard with awesome lighting-LightweightCons:-Screen had backlight bleed in 1 spot-Case doesn't close completely when there is a hard drive installed-Battery life isn't great at all-Lots of preinstalled software (although some of the preinstalled software was cool, such as an included android emulator)",0
"I got an Acer 13 about two years ago and was looking to replace it with something newer. Unfortunately, I'm finding the 15 much less functional in several aspects.- First, the keyboard seems smaller than the 13. The keypads stick more and overall ease of typing is reduced.- Second, the screen quality seems to be worse. Although it boasts better graphics (and may actually have them), print ends up looking more pixelated on this machine.- Finally, the buikier size is not worth the larger screen. The Acer 13 is lighter and more easily fits into an over-the-shoulder bag. It's more useful for client meetings, and feels lighter on the lap as well.Overall, I'd go with the Acer 13 over this model if you're considering both - unless you're going to use the system primarily for gaming or video/movie watching--in which case the visual graphics and better speakers might be worth it.",0
extremely pleased with the Chromebook for my 10year old son.,0

Item arrived as promised . My son connected it up and every thing works perfect. My wife is very pleased with it and we didn't to pay they high price for a full computer. Works well for our needs.,0
"This HP laptop is a great choice for everyday use. The build quality is great with no issues. The screen is crisp and sharp with no dead spots. The keyboard feels good to use even after long sessions.The Intel Core i5-1235U packs enough processing power for it's intended usage, but only having 8GB of ram does bring some concern when considering long term usage. Windows 11 runs snappy and smooth with this configuration, but the drawback is you cannot upgrade the memory. This laptop as configured is more than enough power for daily task at home or at work. I did drop a star because of the inability to upgrade the memory. With that out of the way, this is a solid laptop.Games can be played on this laptop, but be mindful of the specs. This is not intended to be a gaming laptop. Yes, it can play games, but it will not compete with a dedicated gaming laptop.During long usage the bottom does heat up. It's as expected with this CPU, it's not a deal breaker. The battery life is good.I did install Ubuntu in dual boot mode. Linux runs great and everything was detected. I use Linux a lot daily along with Windows.",0
I love my chromebook,0
I bought this device because of the 5G Wireless interface coupled with excellent memory support and superior storage. wonderful price/benefit ratio.,0
BUYER BEWARE:I received the gl703vm-nh74 instead of the 703 SCAR edition which is a very similar laptop but with a 60hz panel and is worth $300 cheaper. TRIPPLE CHECK your computer and make sure every SINGLE component is correct. I almost didnt look into it but I am so glad I did. I am filing for a replacement of the correct model now and will update when it comes.3/27 update: exchange was not possible because of the cost of the item which is slightly annoying. I started a return for this laptop and will not be buying any newer asus laptops because these fans are wayyyy too loud. going with an eluktronics 1070 laptop instead.,0
"We received this laptop and after 2 days the WiFi stopped working, I returned it and only got back 80% of what we paid for it. Very disappointed! Be aware of these models.",0
This thing is worth the money.,0
"So far works very well! We purchased this to use with a drawing tablet but didn’t realize the one we bought didn’t work with Chrome Operating Systems so we are now using this as a homeschool laptop which works very well for that purpose. We love the smaller size as well. I will update if we have any issues with the it, If I don’t update than it is still working perfectly.",0
So far so good. Doesn't get very loud.,0
happy with laptop,0
Fast great screen runs cool a nice laptop,0
I really enjoy my Chromebook. It is responsive and easy to use.,0
EXCELLENT LAPTOP,0
"Slow, overheating, low battery lifeIt is impossible to play recent games. The graphics card is not properly handled by this computer.The worst computer I bought! I really do not recommend",0
The right hand hinge is beginning to break after just 2 years of careful use.,0
"Research ""DelI XPS color banding"" and ""Dell Intel graphics original color black screen"".I bought this laptop thinking I was getting a high end machine for video and photo editing. The colors and display are supposed to be accurate and adjustable. Instead, Dell and Intel somehow haven't been able to figure out how to work together. First there was terrible color banding, and dark/shadowing areas could hardly be seen because of the blocky color bands. When Dell Premier Color is removed, the whole screen goes black and you need to use an external monitor to uninstall Dell Premier Color, Intel Graphic Command Center, and the Intel display drivers, then reinstall the drivers. Intel Graphic Command Center has a reoccurring issue with color adjustments causing a black screen and requiring reinstallation of the display drivers.Other than this display issue, the laptop seems solid. Really unfortunate that a high price point laptop touted as being a perfect fit for content creators would have such debilitating issues with the display calibration.",0
"while I like asus etc, we found this only had 28G space of which windows itself took 15G. we were unable to run any programs due to this lack of spaceI dont fault anyone but these days a 256G is small since programs require so much space, so I;m baffled at this tiny driveBut if you have no need for it, its fine",0
Not a touchscreen,0
Just an incredible machine. I don't get impressed often but this device definitely made the cut. I had never heard of MSI before when I purchased it I just searched Amazon for gaming laptop and this was one of the results. The other day I just saw them advertised in Walmart. At any rate I'm glad I took the chance on this brand and this device. MSI is definitely going to be my go-to brand for computers from now on.,0
"for the price point this laptop is a good value, I have own many HP laptops and they have given me many years of great service",0
Description of product said ‘touch screen’ which turned out to be a false statement. Had to return the computer,0
"Todo bien hasta que revisé y tenia 2 ram de 3000 de 4 gb cada una ,pero trabajando a 2660 mhz se suponía que era una sola ram de 8 y quedaba un slot para el upgrade...",0
Love it so far! Very fast and lightweight,0
My issue is software related. ASUS & Amazon are selling a computer in Jan of 2019 that would not play a YouTube video. Spent over a week trying everything I could find with google. Some fixes would help video but not the sound. Finally when Windows 10 Version 1809 was available and installed Videos played fine and the sound problems all went away. Next time I will go to Best Buy and buy geek squad support. With all of Amazon's power they can't sell a product that works out of the box. As well as Microsoft shipping out versions of software that don't even work with standard applications that have been around forever. What happened to testing products.,0
This was a gift for my daughter. She raves about computer. It fits her needs for college. She takes it with her to school and is very thankful for this gift.,0
"Perfect for my granddaughter for college. She loves it! In her words, this is amazing!",0
"This thing is terribly slow and lags almost to the point of being inoperable for any kind of multi-tasking. Many people told me Chromebooks work fine for them and get the job done, but when I try to do anything that uses any kind of RAM, it just starts lagging and everything moves at a snail's pace. I will actually find myself waiting for the directory in my Google Drive to load, then when I double click on a file I have to wait, then I have to wait for the file to load up, and that's for a Google Doc. If I try to open a Google Slide it lags and is unresponsive.Honestly, I got what I paid for. It's a cheap machine and technically operative, but if I had a time machine I would not buy it and would shell out some more money for a more decent machine.",0
The screen is very pixelated (outdated) for normal everyday laptop use,0
"Pros:- Very powerful (Great for work such as graphic design and 3d editing. Can run games at max and RTX can be used)- Great screen- Steel series RGB keyboard- Plenty of ram that is also, user upgradeable (16gb)- Useful built in program for monitoring temps and changing modes, depending on use case.Cons:- Battery life (When in power saving mode you get about 3.5hrs, When gaming/resource heavy work you get 1hr)- Runs very hot (CPU hits max quite easily, GPU stays sufficiently cool)- Speakers are very basic",0
Everything but the computer's touchscreen seems accurate. This computer definitely does not have a touchscreen on it.,0
Display has a full fledged option suite to adjust,0
Muy buen producto,0
"This laptop is a good value, it works as advertised.",0
"Now that we communicate with Zoom type of meetings, I found my video didn't work. Took it to a local vendor and he found a bad connector for video. Fixed it and cost me $25. Thinking all was well, I then went to a meeting and found the audio from me was delayed a bunch. Checked internet status with another computer, and works great... so the problem is not internet...VERY FRUSTRATING....",0
"As a writer and editor, I need a real laptop, not a Chromebook. After looking at endless models from endless brands, I decided on a trusty Dell Inspiron. My previous Dell lasted 4 years with heavy usage before slowing down. I'm hopeful this laptop will perform even better. The speed is excellent and I have almost 200 GB of hard drive space still available after installing Office 365.It's also a great laptop for listening to music as the sound quality is clear and crisp. Some reviewers have complained about the screen quality, but I think its fine and actually prefer a slightly dimmer display. Bright computer lights give me a headache.The keyboard is excellent and allows me to type quickly and accurately. Overall, this is a serious work horse computer at a reasonable price.",0
Purchased this to take to school. Good quality product with very long battery life!,0
Arrived already open and missing a key. This is garbage.,0
"Run all games smooth butter, fans a bit loud but I think is necessary for the GPU card. I liked the bottom design, seems to have great cooling system. Speakers are bad, but once you add Nahemic drivers it gets better. Screen is awesome at 144hz. So far, very satisfied that it works for gaming. I tried others with RTX 1660 Ti and just couldn't run playable games, by far this is the best value you can get.",0
"The screen quality is good 1080p. Battery life kinda suck. It does drain out pretty fast, I just leave it plugged in. Other than it all good. Gaming is no problem perfectly find.",0
Scam,0
"I mulled over many different gaming laptops in the $1200 to $1600 range, but I kept coming back to the MSI GL 65 Leopard (my first MSI purchase). I did not want to buy any other brands and model except for this one because of the CPU (i7 10750h), GPU (GeForce RTX 2070), and 144hz screen that this comes with. There's nothing close to this price with this CPU and GPU. The screen is vivid and sharp. As a bonus, the keyboard has good response to it when typing and I like the color customization to the color of the keyboard keys. I also like the fan speed option because it is pretty loud when turned up but I was really impressed the silent mode option which keeps the laptop quiet for the operations I have used it with (surfing, videos, games (Sim, RTS, Strat, MMO, RPG, but not FPS). In addition to the 3 usb ports, there is 1 USB C port as well which is a need for me. Keep in mind that on this laptop, the fan vents blow out in the rear left and right and also the back left side as well so keep those area clear. The AC plug is located in the middle of the right side which some may not like , but it doesn't bother me one bit. Overall I am quite happy with this purchase.A drawback to this laptop is that it comes with only a 512gb m.2 SSD, but I was able to add an additional 2tb SATA SSD to it.",0
Not purchased for gaming so dont know if it's good for that. Great for everything else,0
I love it!,0
"We needed a cheap laptop to do Gmail and Google Docs only. We bought this in September 2019. The screen is large and bright, and the sound is outstanding, but there is a painful delay when interacting with Gmail and Google Docs, even if only one tab is open in Chrome. Compared to the Windows 7 laptop we bought for about $300 back in 2011, it boots quickly of course, but is noticeably slower once you are in Gmail. Some browser tweaking didn't make any noticeable improvement.",0
"Writing for the gaming, but not gaming",0
my new Zenbook is a very attractive light blue aluminum and has blue metallic keys instead of black plastic.,0
"I was very impressed with the MSI Leopard laptop. The 144hz screen is the best 15"" display I've ever seen on a laptop and it was able to handle all the games I threw at it with ease (Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Heroes of the Storm, World of Warcraft). It's also very light and comfortable to carry around.For the price, you're not going to get a better gaming laptop that's this portable.",0
Ordered 3one doesn't work waiting for a response as to what to do. But the other 2were great. They were Christmas gifts so 2 kids were happy,0
"I really use this laptop for personal use and for casual gaming (POE, Paladins, ex-Overwatch) and it holds up well in the graphics sector but the video card is soldered to the CPU so it’s impossible to upgrade graphics. It’s sporting a intel UHD 620 and that’s in the low average range compared to other laptops with similar specs. It’s an overall GREAT laptop for the price. I actually recommend Asus over Dell or HP as I’ve had no issues internally with the device so far. It’s light and the metal material makes it very sturdy/durable. You can be active and use it with one hand.The laptop is a bit small so I recommend getting a desk so you won’t feel so cramped. The keyboard is small but not everyone has hulk fingers, I like how close the keys are and it’s backlit too.",0
"Awesome, great !",0
I spent several days migrating my apps and data from a dying Dell laptop (SSD failing) using a USB mouse (because it is easier to deal with for complex screen picks than a touchpad). It was only then that I found that the touchpad was non-functional. Even when booted into BIOS the touchpad diagnostics would not function. Thanks HP (NOT) for selling me a lemon. Works well otherwise.,0
cheap build materials but the most powerful in this price point!,0
Beside the loud fans its a pretty decent gaming laptop. Battery life is lower than expected (1-2hours).,0
"When I first started up this computer, it began updates of the software, then it wouldn't run anything... the evil blue screen of death took over. I didn't even get an opportunity to start taking advantage of all the ""power"" and ""speed"" that it was supposed to have. I had to return it.",0
The touch pad is on the right of the keyboard and doubles as the numeric pad. It feels narrow and awkward,0
"This laptop is perfect for many if not most people's needs. Surfing various websites, online banking, homework, etc. You can stream videos/movies but the graphics/display isnt top notch. It isnt 'bad' its just average.I like that it is a Dell - I sometimes hesitate buying no name products for something this important.",0
"The good first:Price. This is a very affordable laptop for what is included.Speed. I use this for graphic design, photoshop, and some light gaming. It can do pretty big photoshop actions faster than my more robust desktop computer. It is a very fast little machine.The bad:It gets hot. The laptop itself doesn't feel hot, but the CPU pretty consistently hits 60 degrees Celsius doing mundane tasks like checking email. After gaming for 10 minutes, both the CPU and GPU can creep up to dangerously high temperatures. As some other reviewers have stated, it might have to do with poor thermal pasting.The keyboard and track pad suck. I use a USB keyboard because the one on the laptop is nearly useless. The track pad is overly sensitive and often while typing the cursor will jump around because I hovered too close to the trackpad.For the price, I don't mind the issues. It is very capable of doing the kind of work I previously could only do on my desktop computer. So for my needs, it's more than adequate. I definitely don't regret this purchase.",0
Shipping was very quick,0
"This is a high functioning little laptop. However, in researching this model it stated this was a great model for photo editing. That is not true at all!!!! I am extremely disappointed in this computer. I shot photos in RAW and you can't even get the entire Photoshop display in the window. Nor can you easily move it back and forth. I thought I was having issues with Photoshop because I couldn't get all of the functions to show up. Today (after 4 months of playing with it) I discovered that it wasn't Photoshop but my computer that didn't show all the panels of photoshop. There aren't enough ports on the computer for downloading photos are working with the photos. I called Dell and asked which monitor and docking station was recommended for this computer. You can't use the monitor without the docking station. The docking station they recommended only makes the computer jam. So basically the only reason for my purchase is a complete bust. I have a $1700 dust collector. I thought Dell was the best, this frustrating experience has proven otherwise.",0
"Laptop is exactly what I hoped/expected it to be. Light, solid design, compact, and performs well for both streaming and some of the modelling software I use in grad studies. As other reviewers have mentioned, the touch pad is mediocre. However several reviews have complained about fan noise and I have not found it to be an issue. The fan starts up when I run multiple heavier programs, but I don't find it gets overly loud consistently.",0
Exactly what I needed for simple web surfing and streaming. Battery life is awesome and everything seems very quick! Great purchase.,0
"(Disclosure: I am receiving a gaming headset from MSI as a result of writing this review. Everything I say here is true and honestly how I feel)I stream live quite a lot (life coaching stuff plus gaming stuff), and my old computer (2015 macbook) wasn't cutting it CPU-wise. I was looking for a computer with a 10th gen intel processor and found this among many other options. I first tried to buy on Best buy, but after 10 days of no shipping notification I cancelled that order and bought here on Amazon. It shipped instantly and came within 3 days, exactly as scheduled!For the computer itself, it's really good. Came packaged very safely and with cool design. Kind of feels like buying a sports car, but with a computer. My macbook was struggling to stream from OBS at 30fps to facebook (CPU was spiking), and this computer can do that without even feeling it. I am also able to play the game I wanted to (legends of runterra) with a flawless experience. The display on this computer is really gorgeous. Everything works like lightning.If you're looking for a powerful computer, this is a really great option! I have never regretted treating myself to new technology and you should do the same. Nothing worse than a slow computer for your productivity.",0
"The screen would go dead after the top was closed or it went into sleep-mode. Not every time, but often. I sent it back to Amazon and it was refunded without issues.",0
"When I get the device out of the box while setting it up I noticed the bottom was not secure, but outside of that it is a nice computer.",0
It also takes quite a while upon start up.,0
I am in real estate and use this laptop every day. I am not as tech savvy as most my people my age. It is easy to use and not as he,0
"Fast, wonderful working gaming laptop and great working laptop for school work. Great condition, sleek look, and charges pretty fast",0
"This laptop is like new, easy to setup. This computer is fast and performs better that I thought it would be. A great decision on my part.",0
Laptop came in pretty good condition. Had some issues with starting the computer but was able to troubleshoot. Product well worth the price.,0
"I bought this Chromebook needing a cheap laptop replacement quickly. I wasn't sure what to expect from a Chromebook and read a lot of reviews before deciding on this one.I only need it for checking email, internet browsing, and other light computing tasks. It's a slight adjustment going from a traditional laptop to a Chromebook but I have enjoyed it so far. I can get everything done that I need to and it's quick doing it. Honestly, if you need something that is good for light computing this is a great option.",0
Nice and great price,0
"Runs slower than expected. Harder to navigate around programs than expected. Keyboard doesn't have all the buttons than on a regular keyboard. This model is larger than a regular chromebook. Bought it for size of the screen. Make sure this is compatible with your school or college program. Bought a mouse to connect to for easier navigation. Battery life is good, comes with wall charger. I should have bought a regular laptop to use for college school work, it would have been much easier to use. Chromebook programs run differently.",0
This is a gift for my husband he is going to love it,0
"Great deal for the priceOnly issues;1. Battery life sucks2. Heats quite alot, literally any game will take the temperature to above 80 degrees3. Speakers are at the bottom and you can't hear much",0
"Es hermosaTiene teclado retroiluminado, creo que el material es meta o aluminio, la verdad no estoy segura pero se siente de excelente calidad. Solo la he usado hoy que me llegó y va muy bien, es rápida ???Aquí en México casi no hay variedad de laptops, entonces es buena idea comprar en Amazon por importancion, el teclado viene en inglés pero lo puedes configurar para que tenga la repartición como en México.Buenas compra ?",0
Bought this for my daughter so she stopped stealing my computer. Great for what she uses it for (basic school stuff and internet surfing). Great starter computer.,0
Bought this for my husband. He really likes it. Much faster than his old computer and it doesn't freeze like the old one did. He is very pleased with it.,0
"I tried two different types of DDR4 sticks to expand the memory and both failed. It can't boot after installed it, no any display even the logo... pls help advice.",0
"I was completely blown away at the size, power, and design of this laptop",0
"Computer is 1 year and 5 months old. Purchased for appx $955.00. Mini dp port stopped working. Out of warranty which is only one year. Sent to MSI for diagnostic..told I need motherboard. Estimate for repair appx $1,050. No attempt by customer service for some kind of accommodation. Will never purchase another MSI product again. Do not want a disposable one year computer where it is cheaper to buy than repair a computer only 4 months out of warranty, especially when the warranty is only one year.",0
very efficient and manageable,0
"The shipping was a little scary, I didnt think I was going to receive it all, and the order updated and it was delivered the next day. That being said this thing is great. Started right up and immediately connected to the internet. Screen quality is good. For the price you really cant go wrong. It may not last as long as others, or it may! Who knows but for $200 you're getting a good deal. For at home everyday use? Checking emails, YouTube, ETC this is a perfect buy.",0
"I bought this laptop about a year ago (2021) for college. I am a CS major and also wanted to bring a strong enough PC to the dorm for playing games. I am very impressed with this laptop. I play anything from Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, to Apex legends and all the games run very smoothly.It is not that heavy in my opinion, or I'm just used to the weight. I can carry it around campus the whole day without it being such a pain. I would recommend bringing the charger with it. The battery life isn't very good but it does charge quickly. I bought another Lenovo charger so I can just keep one at my desk and another on in my backpack.The laptop is kinda thick but I don't really have a problem with it. I do like how it doesn't scream ""RGB GAMING LAPTOP"" compared to others I've seen.I am a data hog so I purchased an external SDD but it's totally unnecessary.It's been a year since I've bought it and I've had no issues with it yet. I do use an external keyboard at home because the keypad on the actual laptop has the keys really spaced out for some reason.Overall: I highly recommend this!",0
the sound quality is very bad and does not go very loud,0
"It is a very good cheap, light, and fast laptop. It is very suitable for my kind of work. I just recommend it.",0
Awesome i bought a 32 inch screen with it and it runs any game perfectly.,0
This machine could handle 4k renders in Maya while editing texture maps in Photoshop.,0
First one had severe screen distortion. Replacement has just a black screen. Would not but this product again. Spent $50 to FedEx the 2nd laptop to the person that needed it immediately and 2nd one didn't work either. Going to buy a Mac book,0
Awesome value,0
Linda,0
"Absolutely unusable. Bought the laptop for school in August 2022 and writing this review in November 2022. Have never played a single game on the computer, strictly school software - web browser, PowerPoint, word. Laptop is just over 3 months old and the battery dies within 3 hours. Cannot get even half a day of light use from a full charge. I could not imagine if gaming, battery would probably last a max of 15 minutes. Also, 2 screws have fallen out of chassis already. Avoid at all costs, not worth the cheap price for performance unless you can stayed plugged into a wall outlet.",0
It's very fast and reliable,0
Product is fantastic. Well worth the price.,0
"Seems like a good computer, but it was not a new computer. After a couple weeks of using it Windows appeared to be corrupted. I took it to my favorite computer genius and he found that the original free Windows 10 OS was loaded on it. He said that Windows corrupted itself when it tried to upgrade to the latest version, but couldn't, because it has skipped three releases. So again, he verified that the computer was at least 2 years old when it was sold to me. He was able to load all the releases and get it up to date, hopefully I won't have any more issues with this.",0
"The laptop I received from Amazon via “cravings comp llc” gets two stars only because I assume it will work fine in the future. Currently, as I received it, it cannot connect to the internet because it was shipped without the network drivers installed. I will be taking it to Best Buy tomorrow, but it is disappointing to say the least to get a new laptop that is not functional out of the box.",0
Very good laptop for the money. I’m enjoying itUpdate after about a month: still loving this laptop. Haven’t run into any problems and plays all my triple a titles very well. Gets a bit hot but doesn’t seem to go over 159 f,0
Amazon sold me an American cheap product and Acer has refused warranty service support,0
"I received my notebook 6 days ago.After using it for 5days, it could not charge or turn on anymore. I was shocked and disappointed after spending so much for something faulty.Now I had to spend more to ship it to MSI(US) for repair?! (btw I live in Sweden)",0
"So far, I love the quick response time, fast wake up, and overall quality. I haven't done much with gaming, but what little I have it worked great. The screen isn't always the clearest with certain programs, though that could just be the programs themselves being written to a lower definition. I also LOVE the tactile feedback on the keyboard and the full mouse touchpad can be clicked, with is nice as well.The only complaint I have is speakers. The speakers are subpart for this price point, and their placement on the underside of the laptop leaves a lot to be desired. That said, the built in bluetooth makes connecting headphones or a bluetooth speaker easy as can be.Overall, Im quite pleased with my purchase. I honestly haven't had a better laptop since toshiba sold their computer branch. I'm pleasantly surprised to find a laptop of equal quality.",0
"under full load from a graphics intensive game, or in turbo mode, fans are a bit loud",0
"My previous computer setup consisted of a MSI gaming computer and a Surface Pro computer for on the go. I enjoyed owning both machines, but often fantasized if I could somehow merge the 2 machines and get the best of both worlds. I loved my MSI gaming laptop, but it was quite large/thick and heavy. I loved the Surface Pro, but didn't quite handle gaming well [unless you are using game pass or streaming games]. Then out of the blue comes this computer, which seemed like a Surface on steroids. I was delighted to check this machine out and decided to make this my own PC for gaming and on the go.The computer arrived well packed and well accessorized [as one would hope for an expensive piece of tech]. The Z13 came bundled with the XG Mobile RTX 3080 dock, a case for Z13, a case for XG Mobile dock, AC chargers for both Z13 and XG Mobile Dock and writing stylus. It has a nice metal feel and sturdiness to it that felt premium. If you are familiar with ROG products, had that familiar ROG aesthetic all over it. I certainly enjoyed the RGB window in the back showing off some of the main board.The computer is fast and snappy. I had hoped for a 32 GB of RAM version, but at the moment is was only available in 16 GB of RAM. Windows 11 Pro set up pretty quickly and was not too horrible of a jump coming from Windows 10 [though I like Win 10 a bit more]. The screen was nice and bright for a tablet computer and touch was responsive. The Z13 tablet computer is not a bad machine on its own. It's not unitl you involve the XG Mobile RTX 3080 dock that things started falling apart for me and apparantly for other users. This dock gives you Z13 that bump in performance and graphics, but it comes with lots of headaches too.For instance, you are supposed to be able to charge the Z13 when it's connected to the dock. This feature is super handy, that is, if it continues to work for you. After exactly 30 days, the XG Mobile dock stopped charging the Z13. It would not work no matter what I tried. I updated the firmware through ASUS's terrible Armory software and still yielded the same results. I reached out ASUS suppport and they could not even really help me and suggested I send the PC back for inspection and repairs. This was a defeating moment for me, I hadn't owned this machine for 30 days and already I am having to send in my dock and computer in for repairs. The process over the phone was brutal. The wait times were astronomical and I couldn't make use of their chat option since it was being updated at the time of seeking support. It took ASUS about 3 weeks to get it back to me. This was nuts, but the long wait time was attributed to parts shortage. I had to borrow my wife's PC while I waited. Fast forward, I get my computer back and the XG dock once again is able to charge my Flow Z13 computer again. However, this did not last long as after a week it stopped charging the computer again! I wish that I had tested this PC a lot sooner, maybe I would have been able to return it. I had ordered thsi computer whilst on holiday and did not have much time to test it within a return window sadly. I did find an incovenient workaround to the charging problem. Here's what you do: plug in the included 100W AC charger first after completely shutting the computer. Boot up the computer plugged into it's original AC charger and let Windows load up completely. Next, plug in your XG mobile dock and let the system do its connection. I know what you are thinking. You are like, well that defeats the charging from dock option, you are right and also takes up a USB C thunderbolt port too. However, this is only way I have gotten the system to remain charging and have the XG mobile dock working. I refused to send this machine again to ASUS.Let's get into the Armory software on ASUS ROG computers. First off, this software is buggy and glitchy as perhaps Windows Me [lol]]. It's supposed to help you manage the thermals on your machine and other bits of data including updates to drivers and firmwares. After about 2 months in, the Armory software refused to update anything. There would be critical updates for the system itself and the updates would time out and fail. After reviewing many forums and reddits, it appeared I had no choice but to remove the armory software and re-install it. ASUS has an Armory removing software and the Armory software right on their site. It was simple enough to remove, but a nightmare to re-install. I kept getting an error message stating that my internet connection failed during the install. I got the Offline installer for Armory, hoping this would solve the error [because my Internet was fine] and it still errored out. This software controls so many aspects of ROG computers. ASUS has made it this way to be supposedly convenient, but I wished they had made sure their software worked. I still could not install Armory. I had to reach out to ASUS via Support Chat. After barely 2 minutes of troubleshooting, the rep calmy types: Well sir, you are going to need to do a master reset. A whole reset to the system again! The system was completely reset once from coming back from 'repairs' and now that I'd finally got my machine back to the way I like it, I have to bloody reset the darn machine again! With little choice, I master reset the system. The Armory software appears to be cleaned installed due to the reset and it's at least functional again. It just blows my mind that a company this big does not have this software working like a charm. After the reset, Armory appears to be working, but I hold my breath each time there is an update. Will the update work or require me again to reset my computer? I honestly think these things now.I also, on some occasions, have trouble getting my monitor to come on while plugged into the XG Mobile dock. I have a nice Zowie BenQ 240hz monitor hooked into Display port, but sometimes the monitor will not display properly. There is nothing wrong with the monitor. I have to either unplug the monitor from dock or unplug it's power source to get it working again.I apologize for the long review, but in conclusion, I can not recommend this computer to anyone. At this price range, you could get a great computer from other brands with ease (and maybe even save some money in the process).",0
"I just received this chromebook today on Sunday 06/10/18 and i love it. I quickly set it up and put it to work, i had alot of work to do seeing that today is Sunday and this laptop performs well. I love it and so far i'm satisfied with my purchase.",0
"You get a lot of bang for the buck with this notebook computer. It has plenty of horsepower and is well made. The fans are screamers, but that is to be expected with the heat generated by the gpu. Overall, a great purchase.Sager support was quick and responsive when I had questions about Windows activation.",0
"I have buyers regret now. I bought this to update from my old Mac Pro and was hoping I could get some streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc and none of that is available. I use my laptop for movies and TV while traveling. No CD drive and none of the aforementioned items make this laptop basically useless to me",0
"I'm not a college trained computer expert by any means so I can't tell you about the different specs or anything like that, but I've been using laptops since dial up was first popular. I've tried many brands in different price ranges over the years to give me experience to fall back on and I have to say that so far, this little economy priced laptop has pleasantly surprised me. It powers on quickly and has been able to handle everything I've thrown at it. That says something because I'm a multitasker and always have a bunch of things going. It handles multiple browser windows open, videos playing or music playing (wear headphones cuz the speakers aren't great) and my favorite writing program all at the same time without bogging. The battery is even decent. On a full battery I made it six hours before I had to plug it in to charge. Not bad. No, it doesn't measure up, head to head, to my other non-Windows laptop, but I don't expect it to. I got it mainly for surfing online, Facebook games, watching videos, and for homeschooling my grandson. All those things it can do with ease. The main thing I miss is a backlit keyboard. It doesn't have one. So what I'm trying to say is if you're looking for a good economy priced laptop running windows 10 that will let you browse the internet, watch a few videos, play simple computer games or homeschool your child, this laptop is a good fit. If, however, you're looking for something to play the bigger more powerful games or do intensive photoshop, you might want to save up and invest in something more powerful. It's a good basic beginner laptop that can be upgraded with more ram and a bigger SSD or HDD if you need the extra space and have the money to spare.The pictures are in low light and better light so you can see the screen is nice but nope, no backlit keyboard. I personally give it 4 stars.",0
"Got this to replace my old laptop that started having issues charging. Well, at least this one charges and turns on, but that's about it. Since day 1, it freezes constantly (Wi-Fi is fine, all other devices run smoothly), videos on it skip like a badly scratched CD (again, all other devices run smoothly), and keys ""stick"" and make long lines of letters, punctuation, or spaces without the key even being stuck! Absolutely would advise anyone to steer clear.",0
It is really clean there is some black light bleed but i never notice it because i don’t really care havent experienced any screen tear but if you want 30 more frames i suggest buying another stick of ram wither two 8 ram or another 16 ram,0
"As you can see in the picture I have included, the end that goes into the charging brick does not fully go in. Moving it around will disconnect your laptop from charging. I have had this laptop for 7 months and don't get me wrong I love the laptop is just the charging brick. Either I have gotten a faulty charging brick or Asus needs to recheck there items.",0
I have been using Mac for a decade. The new job requested to have a M.S. hence I bought this one from Amazon. Nice one. The only thing is that I have chosen it 15” and this is the first lab top i get it that big which looks a bet weird. But it seems very handy and light. There is no light to show the cap lock is on or off. May be just because I am used to the Mac. The speed and the performance looks satisfactory but it has been only few days with me. Wish it will last.,0
"I purchased this chromebook for small little things, mostly to do some writing while traveling. A chromebook appealed to me because a lot of the work I do is linked through Google. I spent a decent amount of time researching, and I am sorry to say that I pegged this one wrong.For starters the battery life is absolutely atrocious. I gave it a full charge right out of the box without ever turning it on, just like it says in the manual, and used it maybe twice. The big issue wasn't the amount of battery life while using it per say, but I learned that when you power it off, it doesn't truly shut off. It concerned me at first when I noticed that it turns on right away every single time you open the lid. It doesn't power off, it hibernates. So you are draining battery life even when it is sitting on your shelf ""powered off"".If that wasn't bad enough, even if you change it in the power settings to not sleep when the lid is closed, you cannot control when the screen shuts off. If the screen shuts off, yes, you guessed it, it hibernates again.... Really terrible if you are, I don't know, say, in the middle of uploading some pictures from an SD card, and are not constantly hovering around the device to keep hitting a key or moving the track pad to keep the screen on.On that note, the device is really really really slow. I am a huge fan of samsung products, but this one is just terrible. My Galaxy S7 is faster than this thing is. That's pretty despicable.In terms of the physical device itself. I should have thought to get a backlit keyboard. O boy was that dumb of me. And speaking of keyboards, it looks like they crammed in as much as they could into such a small space and went: ""What do you think people will use the most?"" and then cut those keys. Besides your basic ASDF and 1-9 keys there is nothing else really on the keyboard. And the Caps Lock is replaced by a search key. Don't think I needed it, but then again, I didn't do as good of a job researching this time around.Do yourself a favor and spend slightly more money for something good.",0
El equipo en un principio bien pero el mismo día que comencé a usarla comenzó a calentarse al nivel que se autoapago y ya no encendió. Este problema lo presentaba cada que usaba la laptop. Que lástima porque la laptop corria bien de acuerdo a su precio. Ya inicié el proceso de devolución.,0
"One of the best purchases i've done this year! I really enjoy the product and it feels really good when using this laptop, very light weight. The only sad part was it comes with 256GB SSD Disk space, but still worth it!",0

Amazing laptop the could of used a faster ssd but overall it's amazing,0
The best laptop ever really good and really good for school as well👍🏼,0
Used for about two weeks already showing blue screens. Have not taken out of home or dropped it. Not sure why it is happening. Returning item,0

Pretty good so far. Performs as advertised.,0
"Its a good tool for browsing the web and Netflix. After just over a year, I am starting to have problems with certain key inputs on the keyboard. If the keyboard was better quality I would give this a higher rating.",0
"Update at 7/13/2021 It's been less than 6 months of use and almost never using the rgb keyboard lights and already 2 keys dont have green color anymore. Very disappointing in that regards.The overheating issue I solved it by underclocking as undervolting didn't work. However even with the underclock this laptop is a beast. I once tested rendering 2 videos at the same time in diferent Video editing softwares and they both finish in less than 3 minutes. And we're talking about 20 minutes vidwos with several layers and dozens of cuts.Other than the heating and the RGB keyboard it has been a great laptop.------‐--------- Original reviewI got this computer after I had to return a Lenovo Legion 5 because of constant Blue Screens since day 1. So far I am quite happy with this MSI. It is very fast, reliable, the screen is really good and so is the design (very stylish, not screaming Gaming Laptop and the logo at the back gives it some personality)However I'm not convinced it's worth 300 dollars more than a Ryzen 4800 with a GTX 1660ti. I use it for video editing and the speed is identical (very fast, you can render a full HD 24 minutes video with many effects in less than 5 minutes). Also the booting is slower in this case.It also gets a bit hotter than I would like it to, reaching sometimes 94 celsius, but apparently It's normal for these specs . It has a cooling booster which does a great job in quickly cooling the machine.I read many complaining about the fan noise and it's indeed loud and happens at random times but you can activate the quiet mode if you really don't need the fans working so hard at all times.The RGB keyboard is the best in this one. The colors are amazing and fully customizable through the SteelSeries engine, I just highlight my favorite keys and editing is easier than ever.Regarding the exteriors, this machine is a smudge magnet. It is not about finding something to clean it once a week, it's that everytime you open the screen there are very noticeable smudges everywhere, so you have to keep your microfibre cloth with you at all times.The battery is ok, I think it's below average for these kind of specs. The speakers are very good and clear. The keyboard itself is identical to most laptops in this range, the only complaint is the strange key placement. For instance the right arrow key overlaps with the numeric keyboard and you keep pressing it instead of zero, but nothing that the RGB backlight can't help you with.Overall It is a pretty good laptop, I wasn’t able to wait for the next generation of video cards and processors so I’m pretty happy with it. But I don’t think it’s better than a Helios 300, Legion 5 or Omen 15 with similar specs that are currently cheaper. It’s my first MSI so let’s see how it behaves with the test of time.",0
"Unable to connect to WI-FI. And it has a problem just like this. In other words, I can't use it on campus at all. I'm getting it returned. Hope next one wouldn't be like this awful.",0
"Frequently ""hover-clicks"" when just passing over links even quickly.",0
"Became unusable after first update which was required after setup. On startup, after the Acer logo disappears, a blue error screen pops up and restarts the computer. It just keeps repeating...Acer logo...blue screen...restart...Acer logo...blue screen...restart... It's caught in this death loop with no way to enter another command. Don't need a brand new computer that needs to be fixed after setup.",0

"Well I would expect to be able to download any games that are in the play store, but that is not the case. I bought two of these chromebooks and my boys can't get on the games you can get on any other operating system. Not cool.

"(UPDATE 9/17/18) Tested the laptop thoroughly with random gaming, video streaming from Amazon Prime movies while on battery mode. System will completely blank out the screen with no system response unless you hold the power button down. When turning the system back on and log back into Windows, the screen would flicker a lot for maybe 10 seconds then look perfectly fine afterwards. This issue continued at random with the same blank screen issue. Battery had about 50% capacity at the end. House has an ambient temp of 77 degree F with a ceiling fan for the controlled environment. Sad but I will be requesting a return and hopefully a replacement to give this wonderful system class another go. Depending on the QA ethics at ASUS, there might have been no thorough thermal testing and extensive benching before system was packaged for any possible software/hardware defects.(UPDATE 9/14/18) Wife reported that the system has randomly shutdown twice this week while on battery during work. Considering a request for a replacement. Dropping down the level of quality for this product of a brand name with another star drop.(UPDATE 9/11/18) Wife complained that the screen would turn off and had to completely force shutdown to restore. Issue still occurs when on battery mode and power was over 60% charge.Created a Disk Image of current system and started updating majority of the system driversIntel Chipset/Wifi/BTIntel VideoNvidia GPUDisk CleanupWill follow-up later if this helps. Might consider a laptop replacement for a crappy deployment as the initial Windows Logs in the System log files shows a good amount of errors occurring when the instance of the screen turned off for a driver issue of some sort. To lazy to investigate further.(UPDATE 9/7/18) After the 1st week of usage, the system will randomly power down into a sleep state in battery mode. Ran the Asus BIOS Updater and found Version 300 2018/08/21. Initially Version 206 2018/06/21. Tested system in battery mode again with all Office 365 applications opened and Adobe Creative Suite apps such as Acrobat and Illustrator running to replicate what the wife was suffering through when she complained about the sleep/power down issues. System seems stable for now.Was patient for ASUS to refresh their Zenbook Pro as the UX550VE model was nice but it was at it is end of life. Was hoping to find a decent all-rounder laptop with a GTX 1060 that was under 5lbs and around 15"" of screen space but this was fitting the needs properly. After reviewing gaming performance on the GTX 1050 Ti against the 1060, give and take. The UX550GE has a nice body but it will leave evil finger marks on the exterior. The fingerprint reader works nicely for the unlocking Windows and the setup process was straight forward. Please note, since I work in IT as a Desktop Engineer, I seriously hate Win10 with the Cortana features and telemetry crap. ASUS Win10 Image is current 1709 latest release.Played Blizzard Heros of the Storm and Starcraft II. The Intro videos did display some minor distortion on the 4K screen but it held up find for the most part. Have not been able to test 4K movies yet but hoping it will be smooth.Accessories include a microfiber cloth, a spare power velcro tie, Ethernet dongle.Some Notes on the side, I have worked on various Lenovo desktop and laptops, MS Surface Books, Surface 3 and 4, MacBook Pros and they have their Pro/Cons. I must say for the ASUS Zenbook Pro, this laptop series will fair well for good content creation and part-time video gaming.PS: This is for my Wife so I am jealous of her now!",0

"1. Usually, only a third of the page is visible at one time, because the top and bottom tool bars (I guess) are very wide.2.

The pages disappear for no reason, whether I'm typing, or trying to read something.5. It is difficult to keep the zoom in feature at one setting-the page's size increases and decreases with no warning.Admittedly, I am not real technologically savvy, but other computers have not been so difficult for me to navigate.

"I bought a 15 inch E595 for my wife back about a year ago (late 2019) with the Ryzen 5 to replace a T430. While the feel is more mid-range then the T430 we could not have been happier with it. I also am responsible for purchasing for the company I work for and we needed laptops, really wanted something with 8 threads and graphics drivers that played nice with linux out of the box. We looked at some dell options but at the time these where 500 bucks and fit the bill. 13 laptops later, they have become beloved at the company.",0

"As many others have shared, the Apple MacBook Air M1 is a great laptop. The display is gorgeous. The keyboard is accurate and smooth. Apple has the best trackpads! Battery life is so good that there is no anxiety over having enough power to finish the day.The setup experience is so good with Apple products. All I had to do was choose my language and connect to wi-fi and then moments later the laptop was ready for me to login.The laptop integrates so well with the other Apple devices. Although I wonder why it wanted my iPhone's lock screen passcode. I am not sure how secure I feel that my iPhone's lock screen password is shared over the air with the laptop... Otherwise the MacBook Air is a great device for consuming content and for light-creative work.",0

"I needed a laptop to plug into my worksation (in which I also game at ultra wide 1440p) and after comparing laptops for weeks I found that this one has the best performace to price relation (I bought it for $2,049~).Cons:- It doesn't have an sd memory card reader.- It doesn't have an integrated webcam.- I kind of miss the numpad (but I suppose I'll get used to the support one)- That's it.Pros:- Has a support numpad- Cooling is awesome, no thermal throttling so far.- Even though it's made of plastic it feels high quality.- I'm impressed with the display, it doesn't feel like 1080p.- You can dominate starbucks with the RGB lights or you can turn them all off, no problem.- It's easily upgradeable (for a future 32gb and 2tb).- The MUX switch to plug your external monitors directly to the GPU.Finally, let me cite ultrabookreview:""Compared to the 2021 Scar 15, the 2022 model implements a higher-power GPU, a MUX, and an improved thermal compound on the CPU. All these lead to a 7-15% increase in framerates when comparing this 3070Ti 2022 model to the higher-tier 3080 variant of the 2021 Scar 15.This Scar 15 also ends up scoring slightly higher framerates than the Scar 17 previously tested, once again most likely because of the more mature software implemented on this unit.""I'll keep updating this review as time passes but I hope it helps for now.",0
Great computer especially for the price of $599. Boots so fast. Not a ton of space if games but there are slots for additional hard drives.

"I purchased this from an open box deal at Best Buy a couple years back ($600ish) and I have absolutely zero regrets. I didn’t want to spend $1000 to play World Of Warcraft again and was drawn to this laptop. It’s extremely easy to open up and had SSD/RAM/HDD, apologize if I messed up the acronym….but the only downside to this computer is it came with 8GB RAM. That being said, I played WoW on 8GB for almost 2 years on this bad boy without many hiccups at all. About 6 months ago I went ahead and upgraded to 2x16GB RAM sticks and this thing runs AMAZING. I can stream, play WoW, have multiple browsers open and even another game, yet it still runs amazing. Keep in mind, I open it about every 1-3 months and clean it up with some compressed air (delicately of course). Again, it’s so easy to upgrade this laptop, it’s basically built for it and you’ll understand why after watching an upgrade video on YouTube, that’s exactly what I did. I travel a lot for work and I take this thing with me everywhere. I’m sure it’s been banged around a little bit in my backpack and yet it still runs amazing. I have it hooked up to a triple monitor system and I couldn’t be happier (I have the 17.5” screen model). One more thing to add, the screen quality is BEAUTIFUL. Buy this with a warranty if you can (just in case) and I promise you won’t regret it. This is the ULTIMATE budget gaming laptop, feels absolutely nothing like budget and runs as great as a lot of PCs. Buy now, thank me later.",0
"Before purchasing this laptop I did a lot of research. I was looking for something specific that had to include the following;1. VGA2. HDMI3. DVD-RW drive4. Webcam5. Backlit keyboard6. SSD7. Decent Processor8. A good amount of ramThe Dell line of Latitude laptops seemed to meet those needs but only on certain models. I called Olive Computers prior to purchasing to confirm the one they were selling had all those features. They did have one and made sure that was the model I received. I recommend calling them prior to purchase if you have specific requirements such as mine.A couple of reasons why I didn't give a 5-star review.1. The protective lens for the webcam was cloudy. I did contact Olive computers and they replied quickly with a fix. Even though I cleaned the lens from the front, it needed to be cleaned from the back. Thankfully I am somewhat technically inclined but I think almost anyone could have fixed this specific issue.2. The Laptop works great and arrived in decent condition but you can tell it is used with some minor scuff marks.Overall I am pleased with my purchase and plan to keep this laptop as it offers everything I specifically looked for a fair price. As of this review, I still have not had time to test the DVD-RW drive, HDMI, VGA, USB, and other interfaces. I will update this review if I have any problems with any of those.",0
"After a month of waiting my laptop finally came! I was so excited! While trying to get everything booted up the screen would continually go to black. Thinking this was a fluke I continued, but I was wrong. After finally getting all of my preferences set the computer would continually go to sleep. It’s easy enough to wake up. You press a button and then enter your pin. But it just keeps going to sleep on me. Sometimes after 10 minutes of use. Sometimes after five seconds of use. It’s basically unusable in the state. I had to call customer service several times to get a hold of someone who could speak clearly enough to help me and even they suggested to just get a refund directly from Amazon.I really hope I’m the only one this has happened to. If you get this product I hope it goes really well for you. The times that it worked it worked great! But the constant shutting off was enough to make me want to pull out my hair. Awful experience.",0
"I waited a few weeks after buying this before giving it a review. Overall this is a great computer. Keyboard has a good feel, screen is gorgeous and the very narrow bezel make it seem to fill the entire lid. It makes some unexpected noises on startup, but once its running it is as clear a sound as any I've used.Video is clear and it definitely can handle all the games I play without excessive heatup.Only complaint I have is the odd camera position, it's Under the monitor and off-center. The viewer on the far side of skype call is looking over the number pad keys. But that's a pretty minor issue.",0
everything excellent .,0
The laptop is stable. It runs well. The display is fair. The 8GB of memory makes a big difference as opposed to 4GB so get 8.,0
"My priorities in searching for a laptop were as follows: good brand, low emission (meaning low heat and low noise), MATTE display (because the common glossy displays reflect way too much light), HD monitor, >8GB RAM and a Solid State Drive. I spent a lot of time reviewing newegg, bestbuy and amazon for top sellers, along with pcreviews and notebookcheck dot net (which does incredible detailed reviews showing how much heat and noise a laptop generates). I settled on this notebook and am very happy with what I got. The 2018 version is definitely worth the extra $50 over the 2017 version because the bezel (plastic border around the screen) is much smaller resulting in a laptop that is 10% smaller than the 2017 version while maintaining a 13"" screen! The faint high pitched noise put out by the motherboard is only detectable in a silent room when you place your head within 12"" of the keyboard. The battery life is stellar. Under load, the system hardly generates any heat and under light use (browsing/Word), I never hear the fan kick in. This 8th generation i5 is much more powerful than older i7 CPU's. It's incredibly thin. I was worried about the laptop looking 'gold' but it doesn't - it looks very silver with a faint hue. Very fast start-ups - I press the power button from hibernation and by the time I moved my finger to the fingerprint, I'm up and running within 2 seconds. Fully recommend.",0

If you need a laptop for work, your 60 year old co-worker will sweetly ask you what games you play. If you need a laptop for content creation, go with with a QHD laptop. If you need a laptop for mining, stop reading and go re-evaluate your life.Know what you're not getting:- you're not getting a webcam/mic- you're not getting a quiet system, not to say the fans are inadequate, but you should have headphone on for gaming anyway- a 400 or 500 nits screen - it sits nicely indoors at 300 nits- a lightweight laptop - do the research- a thin laptop - again, no one should be surprised- a CPU that's clocked to run hotter than the GPU sometimesKnow what you are getting:- fast screen and response time - even everyday use is smooth compared to 120 and 144 hz. I have trouble seeing the difference between 240 hz and 300 hz- excellent keyboard - it's not for everyone, but if you love mechanical keyboard and the satisfying clicks, you'll probably love this. Check out Linus' video on this laptop.- top of time line specs - at least for the rest of 2021 and half of 2022, you're not going to need to upgrade- a way to let everyone know your RBG game is on point, and that you're probably really sweaty- very good speakers for a laptop- a cooling system that you can customize in armour crate - #lifeprotip, cooling the CPU also cools the GPU",0
This is a great laptop for the price.,0
I've been using lenovo for more than 5 years now and I just keep getting amazed as to how great these machines are built. The legion is a work horse. I've been running premier and light room on it and no complaints on my end. I would recomend for anyone who needs a gaming and work computer.,0
"It is still new, so I'm a bit awkward about posting a review when things could go bad further down the road. Right now, it is fine. When I first turned it on (and for like 3 times after that), it had an error message about accessing memory. That stopped within a week, though, and it has run fine since. So far I am having a blast on it. I will say that it gets really hot really fast and I am purchasing a cooler so that it won't be so hot. Ok so it is one year later and the motherboard has completely fried. Since the company decided to WELD the cpu to the mobo(!!!) I had to buy a refurbished model for close to same price and drop drives in. So not recommended at all.",0
"We bought this Lenovo Chromebook for our daughter (mandatory at her middle school), and the battery failed to hold a charge and the Chromebook won't operate unless plugged in. We sent it back to Lenovo for repair and it came back with the repair ticket stating the battery has been replaced. In the meantime, while it was getting ""repaired"", the warranty ran out. I contacted Lenovo to let them know the Chromebook battery is still not working properly and they informed me the warranty has run out, so I must contact a local service center and pay for repairs. I contested the warranty claim, since it still had the same problem as before, so therefore it was not fixed and it should still be ""under warranty"" with the original repair claim date. I was given another phone number to call, which subsequently does not work. I'd stay away from this particular product and Lenovo.",0
Great Choice....Recomanded,0
Laptop was bought for my grandson and it died almost exactly a year from when we bought it. Windows looked him out and factory reset wouldn't work.,0
Less than 2 years old. Dead as a door nail —power issue. No warranty. Bummed.,0
"Easy to use, love that it's powered by Google!!",0
"I realize that any computer at this price isn't intended to be the most wonderful machine yet I'm still pretty disappointed. There's no way to download anything that isn't microsoft and even then the ""app"" market is pretty clunky. The thing moves sooooo slow. Again, I was expecting a bit of a lag but even typing in Word with no other windows open there is significant time that passes between hitting a key and having the character show up. I bought this to do some work while traveling and ended up having to use google docs on my phone because it was so much faster.Unless you miss the days of dial-tone I would not suggest this purchase.",0
"I needed a cheap laptop to install Kali on. This fits the bill but I had to fight with it to turn off bitlocker, disable the TPM and jettison Windows 11.I wish HP put more usb ports on it because two is not enough. It really should have an ethernet port too but, at least it was cheap. Fortunately usb hubs are cheap and readily available.",0
I like how light and well built the laptop is,0
the anodized brushed aluminum case is a bit of a fingerprint magnet.,0
"I just unboxed this laptop today, so keep in mind that this is more of a first impression. This laptop is selling for $1049 on Amazon, but I've seen it selling at $100 more on a major website with only 8GB of Ram, compared to 16GB on this model. The specs on this laptop are great for this price and it is very up to date, sometimes OEMs will put slightly out of date CPU or GPU in their lower end gaming laptop, but everything in here is current generation. You get a fifth generation, H-series Ryzen 7 with a 45 watt TDP paired with a 3050Ti. This is one of the newest in the 30xx series from Nvidia and it's also on the lower end of the spectrum, it only has 4GB of VRAM and it serves as a replacement (hopefully) for the mobile versions of the GTX 1650/1660 cards which are starting to get older and don't support DLSS just like they don't have RT or Tensor cores. You get support for those higher end features with this card. Ray Tracing and DLSS upscaling can really make a huge difference in performance, especially with midrange cards like this one. This 3050Ti is powerful, it's just not up there with the 3070 or 3080. 1080p at 50-60 frames per second is what you should expect from this system, but with DLSS enabled, you can get more. This would be for the newest games at medium ish settings. You have to be careful because the manufacturer chooses to implement a given graphics card at a certain wattage, sometimes less than what is optimal. Lenovo says this 3050Ti has a max TGP of 95 watts, I think they are counting boost to get to this number. Nvidia says that 80 watts is the highest TGP that can be used for the 3050Ti, so you should be able to get all of the performance that this card is capable of, in this Legion 5.This laptop is really heavy, but that's a good thing, especially since this thing is all made from plastic. It means that there is a very substantial cooling system. Lenovo calls it ""Cold Front"" and it's the third generation of that design. You have controls for how loud you want the fan to get, it can get pretty loud when you are playing a game, but you can slow it down if you care more about noise than performance. The port selection is great, you get ports for days with this thing. 4x USB A, 2x USB C, 1x HDMI 2.1, 1x Ethernet, 1x headphone/mic aux, and power. Both USB C ports have support for DisplayPort 1.4, and the one on the back support Power Delivery. You will only want to use that as a fall back, since 100 watts is the maximum USB C Power Delivery is capable of at the moment, and this laptop comes with a 230 watt charging brick.The screen is good and supports lots of newer technologies. It's 165Hz, 100% sRGB, 10 bit color depth with support for Dolby Vision (and G-Sync + FreeSync). The only downside is that it only can go up to 300 nits of brightness, so I don't know how good the HDR content will actually be at that level of brightness. It's fine for standard dynamic range content, though. There are 2x 2 watt speakers and they sound good to me, they are downward firing. This laptop will make a great content consumption device, in addition to being a powerful gaming machine.I really like the keyboard, It's backlit with 4 zones of backlighting. The Lenovo Vantage app lets you save 3 profiles and change the pattern of the RGB lighting. It's great for typing, lots of key travel and keypress that feels satisfying. The trackpad is excellent, I was surprised at how accurate and smooth it was. I usually type my reviews on a Surface Laptop because I think Microsoft has some of the best keyboard/trackpad combos on windows, but I would be okay using this from now on.You can upgrade this laptop too, it comes with a 500GB 2280 NVMe SSD installed, but there is a second unused slot if you want to add more. I'm going to add 500GB more and report back on that. According to the Lenovo website, both slots only support 2242 or 2280 size NVMe drives. There are 2 SO-DIMM slots, each with 8GB installed, I don't know how much can be added successfully. The Lenovo page says that 16GB is the max, but I don't know if that is total or per slot.Performance has been great throughout my testing today, I will have more to say about that when I update this review after a couple of days of gaming on here. Battery life seems a little short, but I got less than 2 hours with the settings turned up as high as I could while playing Control. But it seems to drain quickly when not gaming, at least at maximum brightness.Here are some results from playing Control and messaging around with the settings:Medium/1080p/DLSS off/RT on =22-25 FPSHigh/720p/DLSS on/RT on =60-65 FPSMedium/720p/DLSS off/RT off = 85-90 FPSHigh/720p/DLSS on/Medium RT = 75-80 FPSHigh/1080p/DLSS off/RT off = 35-40 FPSHigh/1080p/DLSS off/RT On= 15-18 FPSYou can see that DLSS upscaling makes a huge difference, and having Ray Tracing is really nice but it can seriously reduce performance. This was while playing connected to power and in performance mode. Pretty good, though.Update: I’m really liking this laptop and it can perform really well to only have 4GB of VRAM. I think it’s up to each individual to determine whether a 1660TI with 6GB of 192 bit GDDR6 (4.884 Teraflops) would be more advantageous to have for their specific needs, compared to 4GB of 128 bit GDDR6 (5.299 Teraflops) on this with the perks of having DLSS, RT, and the latest Ampere architecture. It really comes down to the types of games (or other work) that you intend to do with the machine. This Legion 5 is a really good buy for $1050. I really like the screen too, it's very good for the price considering the specs of this machine. Just don't get your hopes up for the HDR content, 300 nits is not enough to really get the ""wow"" effect that HDR has on 1000 nit TVs.Update 2: Some newer games do not fare so well in my testing. Playing CyberPunk 2077 on patch 1.23 I was only able to achieve 30fps at 1080p with the lowest settings. Forget about Ray Tracing, it will bog you down into the low teens, sometimes dropping below 10fps. You really have to use DLSS to enjoy this game at a playable frame-rate. I was able to get between 45-60fps at medium settings, using the dynamic, automatic DLSS options where it will upsample from as low as 720p depending how many assets are on screen at any given moment. How TF did they (CD Projekt Red) ever expect this game to run on base level consoles (PS4 and Xbox One)???Other games, like ""The Outer Worlds"" run flawlessly on this hardware in Ultra settings at native 1080p, achieving 70-80fps. It just depends on how the game is coded, and how much VRAM is truly needed. I would check the recommended configuration (not the minimum requirement) to see if the games I was most interested in playing are suitable for this hardware. Some people are going to be better off spending the extra money and going up to a 3060 or 3070 GPU if they can afford to.This comes with 3 months of Stadia Pro, Amazon Music Unlimited, and a Dropbox 100GB plan (for whatever that may be worth to you).6 month update: This machine has continued to work well for me, and I still use it regularly for gaming and other tasks. I have not had any issues that required any kind of support. I added a second 500GB NVMe to increase the storage to 1TB, I may double the Ram to 32GB later on. I still think this is a good buy but that is at the $1050-$1100 retail price it was listed when I received it. It’s currently priced in 3060 territory($1500ish) and that GPU is a lot better because the 4GB of VRAM on this 3050Ti does hold you back in the newest AAA single player games. I hope this nightmare ends in 2022 and we see GPUs return to their normal price, this is getting absurd how long this has been going on.",0
Perfect for my middle school student,0
"It started ""clicking"" 37 days after I purchased it. Acer refused to allow a return despite it being defective as they limit returns to 15 days. They offer warranty repairs, but you have to pay for shipping it to them. I'm definitely not buying from acer again, and I suggest you avoid acer as well.",0
Great love my chromebook no complaints,0
Absolutely LOVE this laptop.,0
"fine device - no problems so far, everything worked out of the box. thank you",0
Got to replace old MacBook Pro. Getting too old and operating system out of date so had to move on. Works great.,0
The keyboard and mouse pad have been moved closer to the user of the laptop allowing your fingers to not feel like you are typing on fire.,0
"What a difference between my old Toshiba laptop and the chromebook! So fast! There are times it seems to freeze up, but it's so much better than what I've had! It could be my learning curve but I'm not sure I can process my android phone information with it and Firefox continues to take over Chrome, even though I've closed it.. and it's not showing up as a search engine under systems!",0
"It was purchased for work to process CAD and Lumion-3D, not gaming. But our design work puts heavy demands on video, memory and speed, similar to gaming. So far, it's performing perfectly and doing everything we need it to. It's not particularly light weight but what do you expect from a large screen laptop. Really happy with this purchase and price.",0
Battery life is only area with room for improvement,0
"Less than a week after purchase the keyboard backlights stopped working. Spent hours trying to find a fix. 8 months in the keyboard itself has stopped working. This is a meh laptop. If I could do it all over again, I would spend more money on a quality laptop.",0

"This Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-36UT has some major flaws. First of all it does have FHD 1080p screen, but has a very narrow viewing angle. You must have the screen at exactly the right angle in front of you to see the colors properly. Secondly, it has NO indicator that the caps lock is on. Thirdly, the charging and power on lights are on the side and can not be seen when normally using the laptop, thus when hitting the power button you have no idea if it is on or not! Also there is no indicator that the num lock is on. Finally, it is difficult to open the lid. Personally, I feel that Acer chinsed out on this laptop and I would not recommend it.",0
"A decent laptop, but see others with better specs offered from big box stores for the same price or less.",0
"The screen its great, with excellent quality that’s very clean. The sound is also good, and its easy to hear every thing, except for sometimes the fan is a little loud. Other then that, its a great overall product and if your just looking to play games like Fortnite or Minecraft, this is the laptop for you.",0
Sometimes it takes a second to boot up but other than that super awesome quality for price!,0
This is so slow. I really hate it. I've laptops with less RAM than this one that were faster.,0
"this computer sucks, it gets viruses super easy and is super slow, wish there was zero stars available, would have used it! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!",0
"This computer is a beast.If anyone needs a computer that can run overwatch at high settings with almost 80 fps, this is for you. I'm sure turning stuff down will make the frames higher. After coming from a computer that ran on the lowest settings at 20 fps, this is amazing.The fan is an amazing detail on it. It'll cool the computer down immediately. So t hats a huge plus. Also the matte screen is a blessing too. From a person who wears glasses it's perfect. You don't get the extra glare from the screen.",0
I can't even rate this laptop since it came with no power cord! Since when are laptops sold without a power cord?,0
Great still using it.,0
It is so slow and the keyboard doesn’t work and also there is a problem with charger. I am totally disappointed.,0

"Whats the point of putting a 3060 on a laptop if your software doesn't work properly.At idle my Temps are consistently 50 Celsius. Under small load the Temps are 90 Celsius. If you have the charger plugged I need to manually change my battery setting to ""balanced"" in order for the cpu to throttle back down to 2.2 ghz. If I want to game then I have to manually change it to ""performance"" for it to shoot up to 4.4 ghz. The turbo button on my laptop does not do anything to the cpu only the gpu. This combined with the aforementioned temperatures really makes me regret buying this laptop. For the same price I could of gotten a much more reliable rig that isn't going to burn out my cpu in two years because of over-volting. Oh which reminds me, they put the new 11th gen intel chips in which prevents you from being able to undervolt the cpu. Never buying another acer product in my life",0
"It's hard to describe this kind of electronic. I can say only that people who now something about laptops performance they will understand from laptop configuration self.Hight quality, super performance, luxury design.... all in one. Price acceptable on this level.",0
So this was listed as very good condition. Under Amazons description for that all essentials to operat and in good working order.It came to us on time but its was well used to the point that the keys where wore off the screen was broken or creased you can see it in the pics the charger was a European plug and the unit would not power up(could not plug into power) but batteries where completely dead.Sent the unit back and 8 days after they received it i am still waiting on my refund of over a thousand dollars very disappointed in Amazon right now,0
Optimal performance and evenly priced.,0
"I was truly very satisfied with my purchase it was a very good laptop for the price but a few months in its useless nothing but a paperweight. A few months after purchase it constantly over heats I have not been able to using it for a few weeks now as soon as I plug it in it automatically gets very hot almsot towards a painful heat level I’ve let it sit unplugged for a few days and I plugged it back in and 10 mins later scorching hot again, very disappointing I wouldn’t recommend this purchase if you don’t want to waste money",0
This laptop was purchased for me to allow for a more portable lifestyle. I have just started my own business - www.maeerasstudio.com - as a narrator and so far have been impressed with the sound quality this laptop puts out! It was VERY reasonably priced! The PERFECT starter laptop for ANYONE!! NICE WORK ASUS!,0

"Came in with no issues. Nice working computer, bright display. Plus has internal space for a 2.5"" disk drive.",0
The camo design is also super cheesy the fake carbon fiber too.,0
"A lovely, truly slim and light laptop. The only complaint, as such, is that the @ key only appears when pressing the double quotation mark (and vice versa), which actually made me laugh once I figured it out. It's the only anomaly on the keyboard. I have been using the laptop most of the day, including downloading Adobe InDesign, which it did without a hitch. I didn't hear the fan at all, which I'd read negative reviews about, so I have no worries about that. I also like the large keys, much more comfortable for my hands than other cramping laptops I've come across. To sum, I'm very pleased with this laptop and expect its smooth running for quite some time.",0
Value for money. Good for Email and simple task.,0
It comes with a beautiful screen with a higher than average resolution of 1920 x 1080,0
"Initially, this laptop seemed to be a fair value for the price. Aside from trackpad issues and a poorly manufactured screen hinge, the laptop performed admirably.Unfortunately, two months out of warranty the screen started to flicker, and I no longer had any control over the brightness which made working in a well lit office a nightmare. One month later (3 months out warranty) the computer stopped turning on. A local repair shop determined the motherboard is no longer functional.Asus obviously refuses to offer any assistance at this point. I highly recommend spending your money elsewhere on a produce that will last longer than 15 months.",0
I am really disappointed with this purchase. We have had to switch to an online forum like many businesses so I need more laptops to connect with our students. All we are using this for is the internet and it is extremely slow.,0
"For some odd reason, after playing my Age of Empires game for about 4 or 5 hours, it feels like the laptop goes into cool mode or something because the fans are not going ballistic anymore and my sound is gone in the game....wtf lol",0
Terrible,0
"My Windows laptop died and I didnt have time to research too thoroughly. Read the initial reviews, one which name-dropped my beloved long-stolen Acer netbook, and thought this sounded perfect: Portability, long battery, ""zippy"" one reviewer called it. And it was indeed zippy as it fired right up and my fingers adjusted to the soft, compact keyboard. Quickly I realized the problem: Google operating systems are not compatible with Microsoft Programs. yes, there are ""add ins"" like band-aids to access Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Access, etc but I need the ability to work offline and MS Office cannot be downloaded on Chromebook. Two years of projects on Microsoft programs and I couldnt work on them. Other programs I use frequently were incompatible with the OS too. Spent two hours online with tech support but in the end, I had to pack this adorable little netbook back up in the box and return it.",0

"As we become more environmentally conscious, the idea of computers with built-in environmental sensors sounds very appealing. These computers could monitor factors such as temperature, air quality, and energy consumption, providing real-time feedback and suggesting energy-saving measures. This could contribute significantly to a more eco-friendly computing ecosystem.",1
So far so good. Very fast right out of the box.,0
I’m happy with it for being a chrome book. Not bad. Very user friendly and intuitive. Volume is good on it and battery life is good. The keys are really close together so it’s not good for extensive typing. I’m happy with it.,0
"If you are using the M chip for the first time, be advised that many programs that run on intel chips will not work. As of this writing there are no ""work arounds,"" except for iTunes. You will need to have a mouse to efficiently use the interface. And C USB hub will allow access to work of previous versions of the OS. It is very fast machine. The migration assistant did not work properly for me and corrupted the operating system requiring professional repair. It will take some time get used to its new features that I can use. I am not a gamer. I mainly use word processing for educational purposes.",0
"I bought this, and a few spares, for a 'don't care what happens to it' laptop for road trips, gifts, etc.I want it to surf, play netflix, and update my social status while travelling.It does this. Much better than the Dell Crap-top I tried first (Inspiron 14"" something).Sure you gotta navigate the Android enviro... but it seems to be much faster and stable than Win10.If you want a GOOD laptop, get a Dell XPS13 when on sale.If you need a crap-top, this is fine.",0
Easy to use and fun.,0
"For it's size and price, you get a LOT of horsepower. The screen is very nice, the CPU is very fast, and with the GPU, I can throw anything at it and play at Ultra/Max. I did upgrade the RAM to 40gb (swapped a 8gb out for a 32gb), and added a 1TB SSD in the previously empty secondary HDD slot. The battery life is reasonable if you're using it to just browse the web or remote in to work, I can get about 3-4 hours. If you are trying to play AAA games, the battery life is good for short gaming sessions of around an hour or two.Last thing: It's hot! Literally, if you plan on using this on your lap while playing games you'll need to get a cooling pad or lap pad of some sort because the air being blown out is very hot.",0
"So this is what happen to my purchase. The first day I received it the box look like it seen hell, but I ignore it and give Amazon and Acer a second change. The third day, the blue screen of death pop up. Needless to said I will never buy anything from Acer again.",0
I find this chromebook very freindly to use. My grandson caught on real quickly on how to use it. I just love it. I got mine ater my 17 y old daughter got one and used it for school and she as well loves it. I would forsure recommend people to buy this for it is affordable as well.,0
"well, this lapto as I expected, it is fast and looks like luxurious, it software runs very well with 10 win, and some software that i have installed, the quality of camera is good, the keyborad without light but good, in spite of its video capacity, it gets on with the games, well i use to work with severals windows and music at the same time until now i havent seen that the computer has taken time to do something je, for me due to the price , is perfect..",0
"This computer is amazing, very reliable. Its not heavy at all, which was an important feature for me because I use it for college. I don't think I'll ever buy another brand.",0
I love my new HP Computer. It works great and the High Definition is awesome.,0
"Great laptop; easy to carry, plenty of power. There's some fan noise, but not enough to be distracting in most environments.",0
"Es un buen articulo aunque algo engañoso, si estás interesado en una garantía extra en México no tienen, la batería el primer día decía que duraba 4 horas hoy en día, a 1 mes de su compra, la batería dura a lo mucho 1 hora 50 minutos, la maquina tiende al calentamiento como cualquier laptop gamer pero si es ruidosa incluso en un modo ""equilibrado"". Por otra parte critico el teclado siendo está su versión de 17 pulgadas pudieron haber hecho una distribución del teclado más amplia como en sus predecesoras. En cuanto a su rendimiento es excelente, me gusta que tenga la tecnología híbrida de sdd y hdd. Por ultimo su cámara es bastante pobre uno creería que por este precio la laptop tendría una mejor y en una posición optima pero no. Otro punto en contra el lector de memorias sd no funcionaba debido a una incompatibilidad de este tipo de puerto con Windows 10 y no es algo sencillo de arreglar. Fuera de eso la maquina es buena pero no creo que sea mejor que sus equivalentes pasados de hace unos años.",0
"Great small computer, I use it every day .",0
I love this laptop my only problem is it overheats extremely fast Durning my video editing process. Other than that there’s no real complaint,0
This laptop will definitely be worth your money if you don't plan on having a whole gaming set up like a monitor and computer and all of that' if you want something really amazing fast and slick looking buy this laptop its one of my best purchases. I highly recommend this laptop for any person that's starting a gamming set up that's basic and cheap but really efficient and fast and can run every game you could think of and looks realistic its overall one of the best laptops you could own. Get this laptop and you will not be disappointed.,0
Laptop is fast and easy to use. I like that it's light weight and small enough to take with me places.,0
"El producto viene segun lo especificado en la oferta (sin sorpresas), agrego que si mantiene un excelente control de temperatura a pesar de colocarlo en maximo rendimiento, muy poco ruido; pero considero que para mi necesidad lo requiero con una mejor tarjeta de video y mas RAM.El articulo llego antes de la fecha estimada y muy bien protegido.",0
Me encanta el tamaño y es más linda de lo que se ve en la foto. Súper cómoda y hasta ahora está 100% (llevo 2 semanas de uso),0

"Nice laptop, no connection issues after uninstalling McAfee. However, it's so incredibly loud?! Almost immediately after turning the laptop on, I noticed that the fan was already running. Only issue I have with the laptop, but the constant on and off fan noise is annoying.Edit: Solved the fan issue by updating drivers. It still gets loud sometimes but isn't nearly as bad as before.",0

Just know that if you were to purchase this product you are getting exactly what you expected. It works. No hiccups or hangups. It's just fast, smooth and a premium looking laptop. I cant say enough good things about this device. Just take care of it and trust that you will have a working computer for the next decade or more. Get it!!",0

"I received this computer on 12/11/18 and used it for less than 5 weeks before it stopped working (I.e. wouldn’t work without being plugged in, wouldn’t stay on at all, lost all of the work done on the computer, etc.). This was also incredibly inconvenient timing, but my broken computer wouldn’t know that since it didn’t work.",0
"Always wanted a sleek and light, relatively powerful (i7) laptop. The new Galaxy Book2 delivers on the former but is seriously lacking in the latter. The laptop has performed no better than my previous one, an Asus Vivobook, which has a now three-year-old i5 processor. Moreover, the TouchPad is glitchy and confuses two-finger commands for three-finger ones, although that may be a Windows 11 issue.Overall, I am disappointed and would not recommend this laptop at its current price point of $1,150. If thinness is not a priority, one can find a similarly performing machine for 30% less, I figure.EDIT: Between Samsung and Microsoft, this computer comes with about 80 apps running in the background. After uninstalling all the ones I'd never use, as well as disallowing almost any from running in the background, the computer is performing much more as expected.Edit 2: I'm now getting random black screens, and there are numerous other little bugs like the cursor appearing random places on the page while I'm in the middle of typing something.",0
"Very good laptop overall. The 300Hz screen is great and color reproduction is amazing too. Keyboard is nice and the large trackpad is also very responsive. While playing heavy duty games for a long time make sure to slightly elevate the laptop from the table as it allows for better cooling. I can get around 180-200 frames with low graphics, 100% screen resolution and MUX switch on.This review is written to extend my warranty for the laptop however my views are completely honest and reflect my true experience with the laptop.",0
"It's a great laptop almost a desktop replacement, however there is one big flaw. Whenever I am playing a game the track pad just stops working. What I've read online this is a windows 11 issue though none of the troubleshooting things I've done help. An otherwise great product ruined by a crap operating system. Update dropped this to one star cause I literally cannot use this thanks to the most recent windows update. Without the option to let me use windows 10 which was stable and functional I have to use this windows 11 garbage now im endlessly stuck in a blue screen of death loop. Do not buy any product that comes with windows 11 the experience is more like a virus.",0
Interesting keyboard lighting options and sufficient hardware to run the games I like.,0
"Almost everything is top-notch: Performance, battery life, new magic keyboard, usual unparalleled trackpad, quality of materials and build. I was a little concerned about lower screen brightness of MB Air versus MB Pro prior to purchase, but have no complaints. Only feature less than excellent is camera, which is only 720p. Limited ports only a minor inconvenience. Most highly recommended.",0
"I figured it was about time to replace my old HP laptop (still running Windows 7) and this looked like a great system. The speaker system/sound is great...much better than Bose that I've had previously. The biggest disappointment is that for the cost, this should have some sort of usable software on it. I've purchased several laptops for others over the past few years and for this cost, all have had SSD drives and at least Microsoft Office on it. The Office on this laptop was an online subscription link. It wasn't the ""real"" Office that you use on your computer (which is what I use). I had to purchase Office ($$$) and then install it. Due to the fact it has a spin drive instead of an SSD, it took 45 minutes to download the Office software onto my laptop. This could have been cut in half or more with an SSD. My computer geek guy said I could upgrade and add an SSD for under $100 plus installation.The use of the machine is easy. The screen is nice and has a touch screen (not that I use it but it's there) and turning off the camera and microphone were easy to do as well. The weight of the laptop isn't burdonsome either. I love that it has a 10 key....which I use a lot.All in all, it's a great machine....much more than I need in a lot of aspects. I just wish that it had an SSD so I'll probably upgrade and add it. I have not had any issues with it ""falling asleep"" as another reviewer. I went in and set up the screen saver and sleep modes with timers and it works.",0
"This is a well constructed machine, looks pretty, works fast enough for the use most people needs.",0
The keyboard broke with in a month and now the sound went out! I’ve it two months!,0
"This thing is quite the monster, its fast with the 1660ti.",0
Nice screen and keyboard and good size.,0
Renewed as described by Amazon is that the product comes as if brand new. My hard drive went out AFTER the 90 day window to exchange/return my laptop. When i replaced the hard drive I noticed there are screws missing from the hard drive bracket: possibly resulting in the hard drive failure due to vibrations from not being properly secured with all necessary screws. Now i have to call Amazon and listen to them repeat that its too late for exchange nor reimbursement for the money i spent to replace parts that were not secured properly. “Renewed” ?? I dont think so!,0

muy buen notebook para precio,0
"The only thing I can’t figure out , and I haven’t put much effort into it since I’m in the hospital is how to turn on the touch screen option. I thought it would be automatically on . Other than that I love my new MacBook Air Laptop and would recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop computer",0
"This laptop listed as (10SCXK-211) may appear to be a good deal and ultimately it is still a decent laptop but the specs are not accurate. The listing name and description state 2 different GPUs as 1650 Ti and then as 1660 Ti of which it is neither of these. It is actually a standard mobile 1650 NON-Ti. Now this doesn't make the biggest of differences but it is a step down in performance of what is the most expensive component in the machine (GPU in 2021).And now the biggest letdown; it is listed in the title and in the description that the laptop has a 144hz 1080p Display, but it is actually just a cheap 60hz panel with terrible viewing angles and minimal brightness, and yes I made sure it wasn't a driver or settings issue before I realized even the sticker on the box listing the specs does not mention 144hz. This feature adds the biggest value to a ""gaming"" laptop after the GPU.Now these things considered it is still a decent laptop and I have other uses for it so I went ahead and ordered another better gaming laptop from Amazon and reached out to amazon support about also keeping this one if they could compensate me for the specs being misrepresented and at least correct the specs on the Amazon listing. They originally offered a $10 discount but then offered $15 which I reluctantly accepted since I didn't want to have to send it back and I had already spent hours setting it up and updating it and then trying to figure out why I couldn't get the 144hz to work and decided I would just gift it to a family member. Amazon should understand the difference in value of these misstated specs and offer more than $15 for the difference, although I did have the option to send it back instead.So everyone just be warned that they still haven't changed the specs on the page and description. There is very little info to be found online of this particular model # in the listing but the actual specs are closer to MSI Model #: 10SCXK-066 which you can find info on from MSI website and the only difference between that 066 and this one is that the 066 has an extra 1TB HDD.For any prospective buyers considering this laptop, I suggest keep looking for a better deal.",0
It is exactly what I wanted...so fast..really lightweight...very satisfied,0
"I love it, easy set up, very fast",0
Overall great laptop for what I need. My only gripe is the fingerprint reader is not usable as it won’t recognize a fingerprint to setup.,0
This is the product that is highly used for gaming as of 2020. I would definitely buy it again for other family members that need something to get an edge on the competition.,0
"This laptop is my first, and great for what little I do on it: social media, email, games...things like that. I'm over 70 and got it up and running myself, although my 20 year old grandson did all the technical things for me. He loves it, so it must be good. It doesn't have a touch screen so I ordered an Acer wireless mouse. I'm happy with both the mouse and laptop so far. I can't comment on the battery life since I use it only a couple of hours a day.",0
"Great buy, love the smaller size too!",0
"Excelente, muy rápido. Le pienso poner un disco adicional y más memoria, pero aún así como está, me fascinó.",0
"I didn't want something huge and bulky like Alienware, and was afraid to get a brand from a less reputable manufacturer.",0
"First thing to note that is not a good device for entertainment usage as the speakers are bad, and the screen resolution is not good for video playback especially if your eyes are used to 1080p or 4K displays.As mentioned in the title this is a great device for e-mail, internet browsing and typing word documents.Excellent for students and/or those who travel for work as the chromebook is lightweight, rugged, has spill resistant keyboard, and a low price point (when it comes to laptops). Giving you piece of mind if it were to get damaged during transit since almost everything on this device is cloud based (assuming you back everything up)You can install apps on it and not programs to the device (unless you jail break it, but then the specs is bad so you may have a bad time). It's basically a tablet with a keyboard and a google chrome browser which is attached to your google+ account and google drive accountIt has a nice textured grip on top, easy to grab and go.Keyboard is a bit cramped if you're used to traditional keyboards and you may mistype a lot of keys at first, but after a while your fingers will build muscle memory and everything will be fine. Instead of cap lock there's an instant search feature, but you can change it to caps lock in the settings. There's also no insert, home and delete button. Also no F (F1, F2, F3, etc) keys, but there are other built in shortcut keys along the topEntertainment wise, it's not good. Screen is great for productive tasks such as e-mail or typing up an essay, but for watching high definition videos it's sub par. Speakers are on the bottom of the chromebook which doesn't make sense as it muffles the sound. If you have background noise, such as TV running in the background, the TV may overshadow what's on the chromebook (depending on volume set on TV). You cannot play high end games on this device as there will be tons of lag, frame rate drops and/or crashes.Webcam is good. Not pixelated at all. Great for conferences. Skype doesn't work well, so you have to use hangouts or Google Duo.Battery life. If you do not use it for entertainment, it can last around 10+ hours. But if you watch a lot of youtube videos for example it'll drop down to half, around 5 or 6. It charges fairly quickly so you'll be up-and-running again in no timeAdapter it comes with is also portable. There's no power brick, but the plug that goes into wall or power brick socket may take up to 2.5 spaces depending on how you configure itOverall, great travel companion (whether it's a business trip or from class-to-class) for those on the productive side, as you can leave your main power use laptop safe at home. For the price, it's very good as long as the main usage is outside of entertainment (unless you consider writing essay and reports entertainment)",0
It is a constant swooshing sound that's very clearly audible in a quiet room.,0
Had this for about a month and had to send it in for a repair. This is ridiculous that a new computer needs repair this soon. They didn’t offer to replace the pile of excrement.,0
"Estaba buscando una laptop para producción musical, mientras más investigaba encontraba mejores opciones en las laptops para gaming, que funcionan a la perfección para la producir/componer con los programas indicados. Probablemente le compre una tarjeta de RAM extra, no es indispensable pero siempre pienso en modificar lo que tengo o hacerlo mejor. Hasta el momento estoy satisfecho, no tuve que comprarme una Macbook Pro para sentirme bien y poder trabajar tranquilo, así que en cuestión de presupuesto también veo esta opción muy superior, incluso al resto (que no son Apple) de la misma gama.Muy recomendada.",0
It won't power on if unplugged and immediately shuts down if unplugged,0
Bought this to use while my Mac was shipped off for a couple of weeks. Great little net surfing book and super fast. My only complaint is that I couldn't download Microsoft office onto it!,0
"Firstly, this laptop gets MAYBE 4 hours of battery life, which is 1/3 the advertised 12h. The ONLY programs I use are browsers, FTP, and Textpad, and I keep the battery settings dialed way down. Secondly, I've owned it for less than 4 months and the adapter just stopped working. And I take care of my equipment; it's not like I throw it around. I wish I'd stuck with Acer. Thirdly, when I attempted to contact Asus about getting a speedy replacement? Nothing. Crickets. No response via email, my Asus account, or twitter. Nice.Other than the poor service, poor battery life, and poor adapter quality, everything else was pretty nice.",0
Nice book. Good value,0
Very happy with this machine. Just what I expected in performance.,0
I ordered two laptops for Christmas presents. The screen on one of the laptops stop working. I sent the laptop back and my money was refunded in a day. I could not been more happy. Great company to deal with. I am planning to re-order the same laptop today. My kid loves this laptop. The speed is fast and the picture quality is awesome.,0
"Great value!As amazing as described! Really powerful!Not too heavy, nice lighting and performance!No cons so far.",0
Very UNDERWHELMING.Definitely returning for a refund.Ran 3 benchmark tests and it scored so poorly. The graphics card is so bad it’s struggled to even complete a basic graphic test. And the i5 processor feels super dated compared to i7s of similar price. Based on the specs I was ready to love this machine but it performed so poorly I have no choice but to return it.,0
Exactly what we needed for school clases :),0
"It is slow, the memory fills up with just the apps it automatically downloads and its updates.

"This computer was a great laptop, I got it a little over a year ago, never had any performance issues or any other kind of issues prior to a few days ago; it has never dropped, had spills, or incurred any other damage, this weekend it randomly died on me.I opened it up to play a game and just heard a 'pop' from it and it went black, it no longer charges and doesn't turn on regardless of what I do, I've tried removing the battery and did all the stuff I've read to try and all the stuff ASUS told me to do over the phone.Of course it all happened right after the warranty expired. If ASUS isn't able to fix it them I'm definitely not going to be buying any of their products anymore and definitely won't be recommending their products to anyone. A computer shouldn't cost this much of it dies for no reason a year later.Also DON'T buy the Asurion warranty it asks you to buy, they are a nightmare to deal with and still haven't even gotten back to me after two days, read their reviews before ever using them.",0

insane hardware for the price paid. great laptop,0
I replaced on older 2009 MacBook Pro with this new model from Apple. It has the new M1 chip and it is fast. For the type of things I do in a home office this is lightning fast. I don't do a lot of editing of videos or play video games on it so my work load is pretty mundane compared to others. I like it though because it is lightweight when I take it to my den or on a trip in my computer bag. The battery lasts a long time and the keyboard is very responsive. Love the screen clarity. I have not found any of my regular apps having any difficulty running on the new chip. I did set up a new camera connection app to see how it would do and had no issues either. It is running in the background and when they update to work specifically with the new chip it should work even better. I don't have any negatives with this computer. I have been an Apple fan for several years now and so use to it that I have great difficulty when trying to use a Window's based computer.,0
"Chat support will put you on hold for ""2-3 minutes"" (but it's actually much longer) and then it AUTOMATICALLY DISCONNECTS you if you haven't typed in anything for 5 minutes.",0
"Got the laptop and everything worked like a charm. Others have said that the CPU runs hot and needs to put the fans on blast always and as I'm writing this review the fans are going fairly crazy. During light gaming it feels like it overheats a bit. During heavy gaming it gets pretty hot.Biggest complaint is with the keyboard. It looks like it was designed by someone who never takes their right hand off of the mouse. It's great for gaming, but awful for programming. Just noticed the numpad page down/up and home/end so hopefully that makes things better, but for such a large laptop it's a bit confusing why they wouldn't have a full keyboard layout. Then to waste an entire key on * / + - seems a bit upsetting to me. Also the arrow keys location is scrunched up in there.Very happy with the laptop, don't get me wrong. But, come to terms with the keyboard first and I think your experience will be better. Also, to ASUS...come on guys get this figured out.",0

"This laptop comes with a moderately small SSD drive and 4 GB of RAM. The RAM is the minimum requirement for Windows 11 and it shows. Just after boot with no apps running the RAM is at 90% in use.Start running Teams or a browser or an Office app and you are pegging the memory and you will notice the cpu being pegged and slowish responses. But like I said, you get what you pay for, this is a computer designed to have the minimum specs unless you upgrade.The screen is fine, setting it up was fine and the only issues I had with installing things were due to Windows 11 and the Windows Store not wanting to install non Microsoft apps. I installed my own Office from work and ran Teams.If you want a very inexpensive laptop for doing minimal work this will suffice.",0
The SSD died within 5 months,0
Honestly I was scared of getting stuff from Amazon especially when it comes to apple products but ACTUALLY it came in really nice. The box didn’t came damaged or lost/stolen (which is my biggest fear lol) but yeah REALLY LOVE IT!!!!!,0
Runs a bit hot on the surface when gaming and the fans a bit load,0
"I have had this laptop for about 9 months now. Today will be the third time, yes I said third time, I am sending it in for “repairs”. The first time the screen would turn on 3 weeks out of the box, sent it in(which they send you a label but you have to buy a box and packaging to keep it safe) and Acer said they repaired it, well they must not have checked their repair because it still didn’t work. So I had to get another box and packing and send it in again for “repairs”. Mind you it takes 7-10 business days which is 2-3 weeks for repairs, that’s no good when you are in school and need the laptop you purchased for that. So I received my laptop after the second “repair” and I’m the screen worked and turned on, but now the fans didn’t work and the nitrosense button stopped working….I said whatever because I couldn’t send it in a third time in a row, it’s like they don’t check to make sure everything works after they “repair” it. So now 4 months later the laptop doesn’t want to turn on. So their solution is to “repair” it again. I don’t know how that works when the first two times didn’t work. I’ll update when I get it back with the “repairs”. If this is how they want to do business you should choose a different company to buy your laptop from. They shouldn’t sell broken laptops.",0
I found big cosmetic but nice work.,0
The coolest thing is how lightweight it is,0
"Love the design the red keyboard lights are really nice it's really powerfull, easy to upgrade for anyone trying to make their laptop faster and overall very happy for what I got and in terms of price its probably the best really looking forward for a long journey with the Acer Nitro 5.",0

"Thermals are great and the hotkey to toggle between silent, balanced, and turbo is wonderful.",0
"I ordered this product Feb of 2020. I had read reviews that the battery runs down fast, but mistakenly thought, not a big deal, I keep it at home, near the charger, it's just for light use. What I didn't realize is that the charger would die after a year and a half (which I replaced on my own dime,) followed by the actual battery before even 2 years. Back to repair shop but definitely too many problems within a short amount of time and a truly cheap, crap product.",0
Excellent choice for a gift,0
"--DO NOT BUY THIS FOR $1250--The 2060 model is $1170 and is 10% faster--They are charging the brand new price of this laptop from last year.--I've heard of overheating problems with this laptop yet i've hardly experienced any. Prop the back up 1 inch and invest in a computer fan but make sure its compatible.--Still a relevant GPU and the CPU is overkill. The same CPU is being used for all the new generations.--I highly recommend throttling the CPU to -0.140 for desktop work and disabling the GPU. For gaming the PC will crash if the CPU is throttled below -0.135.--It does run hot but if you treat this laptop right. Regularly dissemble for dust cleaning and repasting the thermal paste the computer will last.The only issues i've had is with GEFORCE freezing on driver updates and not allowing it to ever continue. This issue was short lived.I went through two spells of blue screening during gaming which I relate to the game driver. A simple factory reset fixed this issue.Note to consider- Many gaming laptop companies have horrendous and absolutely useless customer service. They will charge you an arm and a leg for repairs. ACER is one of these companies but their products are fairly good for the price. If your screen or components ever fail you'll be paying $500+ for repairs so don't break it--The CPU bottlenecks the GPU which is a good thing--Do not buy a less powerful GPU for a laptop than a 1660ti. Any less powerful and you'll be replacing it in just a couple years spending $2,000 on two lower end gaming laptops because the GPU became obsolete instead of $1200 now. Avoid the 1650 gpu.--Make sure this particular model does NOT come with the MAX-Q 1660ti. MAX-Q essentially means it's 20% worse.",0

"Do not believe the listing. It states clearly in several places, wifi 6 certified and 802.11ax. It's false advertising. I bought this in order to be future proofed. I didn't realize it's not wifi 6 until I started having problems months later with the cheap Realtek 8822CE wireless card in the laptop. Look that chip up, it's an AC card, not AX and it can't even do AC wireless properly. It's a cheap wireless chip that drops packets and firmware updates just made it worse. Plenty of people complaining about issues with it and ultimately having to replace it. I'm currently using a cheap USB wifi dongle so I can have a decent connection to work from home. Seller hasn't even responded. Amazon should be going after them for false advertising.",0

Lo agrego en la tercera foto, no se si sea normal. El único detalle es la falta de ñ. Se puede configurar el teclado pero no es lo mismo.La batería es decente. Al instalar todos mis programas duro muy bien.Lo que me gusto es el peso y tamaño. Es ligera y relativamente mas pequeña a laptops del mismo tamaño de pantalla.Obviamente voy a continuar probandola y actualizar la reseña.",0
"I've had this laptop for about 2 months now and I'm happy with it. Thus far it has had great battery life (I can go a few hours without a charge), all ports work fine, it is incredibly lightweight (I barely notice it in my backpack) and I haven't had any issues yet. The computer is quiet and runs quickly when I have numerous programs open. The fingerprint reader is nice, but it doesn't work all the time (I'd say about 70-80%). The screen's colors aren't the brightest and occasionally images as crisp as they should be. You should also be careful resting your wrists on it while typing because there is keyboard flex.",0

"Context:I am a casual but enthusiastic gamer.I most frequently play Elder Scrolls Online (MMORPG), and I like to turn the graphics up as high as I can without causing the game to freeze.I'm coming from an HP Omen that's a couple years old.I considered offerings from Origin PC, but ultimately decided this was a better value.This is not a dedicated gaming rig. I use it for everything.IMO, this is a great gaming rig. Sub-$2k and has an RTX-2070? Great deal, and a nice step up from the GTX-1060 in my Omen (not a jab at Omen, I could have bought newer gear from HP instead of MSI).Playing ESO with the old Omen, I kept my graphics settings near the upper end of medium. The game would occasionally get freeze-y with a lot going on, but would be tolerable enough. The fans would howl every time I launched the game, and continue running like jet engines until I quit. I occasionally kept my game running in the background and open a web browser for a few minutes, at which point my GPU usage would jump from around 80% to pegged at 100%.With this machine, I've pegged my graphics settings in-game -- everything is set to its highest value (except particle suppression distance - it's at 75%). The GPU still pegs 100% if I also open a browser, but without the browser I hover between 65-78% GPU usage. I was expecting hurricane-force winds at these settings, but I barely even notice the fans. Graphics are quite noticeably improved, and the game has not yet lagged or frozen on me.Keyboard -- I like it. Soft but not mushy.Monitor -- not 4k, but a great monitor considering all else included at this price.Speakers -- garbage. Unless I've missed some important set up step that improves the output, these speakers are tinny and harsh.Sound quality through good earphones -- excellent. Nahimic is awesome.Data storage -- Subpar IMO, but again, at this price/hardware combo, definitely acceptable. I bought an SSD separately and plan to install it soon.Longevity -- no idea. I've had this machine for a couple days.",0
"This is the second ASUS laptop that I have bought. I needed a new one after about 7 years, and I wanted something smaller and lighter, especially as I would be travelling. (The bigger one was harder to carry to college, which was one of its cons.) The new laptop is exactly what I wanted! I love holding it because it's so small, and I look forward to being able to carry it around without trouble.I will try to update when I have had a chance to use it more.",0
"It does exactly what it promises! This laptop is only for internet usage. It works like a dream. If you're a gamer and need a bunch of ram, this is not the computer for you. Read the description. That's exactly what this product does. It's perfect for our current needs.",0
"Laptop was working perfectly until, after two weeks, it simply died after playing a very non demanding game, kerbal space program. Temperatures were normal and the computer just randomly crashed and then could never post.In order to attempt to fix this on my own I went to take out the battery for 10 seconds. However, the battery casing is very poorly design--its placed inside the case!! Its not like the hp laptops where you can just swap it out easily by pushing a button. No, you have to remove a good 12 screws and take off the bottom panel just to remove the battery. I also sliced open my finger trying to undo all of the annoying latches without breaking the flimsy bottom panel. Oh, and by the way, it took me 10 minutes to realize that there was another screw hidden under the dumb factory seal label!!!! Very annoying and frustrating since it was very stealthily hidden. Lastly, you'll want to make sure you're very gentle when removing the case because it would be very easy to break off the little plastic latches that snap the bottom panel on.Currently put a support ticket into MSI and fortunately I'm within warranty, so I will update this depending on their responsiveness and ability to get my laptop working.So far im very disappointed, but I understand that electronics sometimes have flaws because of the laws of probability, and it may have actually been nvidia's or intel's fault, so I will revert this to 4 stars if MSI solves my problem. It would be 5 stars if the battery wasn't behind the bottom panel.UPDATE:MSI's RMA process was excellent. They did a very professional repair, it looks brand new and runs well. I was worried that they might mess up the thermal paste after putting in a new mobo, but it appears. Apparently there was a crack in the chassis that I did not even know about and they replaced and fixed it to without me even mentioning it! They've done right by me and I am impressed. I would give this 5 stars, but its not quite perfect due to the fact that the battery is on the inside and you have to remove 12 screws to get to hit. Besides that however this is an excellent product. I'll update if this dies again but MSI RMA service was fast and beyond expectation. Including shipping, receiving, them having to get new parts, and them fix it, it only took 2 weeks, and they rushed it so that I could get it before my trip. You won't be dissatisfied with the RMA service if you need it, so you can probably trust that MSI will do right by you. Thumbs up MSI. Killer deal for 899.",0
"This by far is one of the best laptops I have ever owned. It is robust and well built. The display is bright and crisp. The touchscreen and S-pan is right on. The keyboard is great. Its fast. It has google play store now which allows you to use android apps. In my opinion this was the deal maker for Chromebooks. Before you could use real (non google) apps they had limited functionality.IMO this is the pinnacle of evolution in terms of light-use mobile computing goes, I've been looking for something like this for years. Samsung did a GREAT job with this.The only drawbacks in my opinion is that the battery life is not great. It is much better compared to a traditional windows laptop, however, I used to have ASUS chromebook that would stay charged for weeks when idle and like 10 hours when I was using it. My experience with this chromebook is maybe 4-6 horus. The bigger issue is that the battery discharges quickly when not in use. I'd be okay with it if once you started using it you only had 4-6 hours, but it is a bit annoying to charge it up, wait a few days, and find that it down to 20%. I would ask that SAMSUNG addresses this...maybe its a software thing burning up battery in the background?Otherwise great machine. Its kind of aesthetically pleasing too, seems like the went for the macbook approach in terms of styling. I do wish that they offered a premium version with aluminum instead of plastic.",0

"I read alot of reviews about numerous issues with the x1c6 but mine has had no issues at all. my only complaint at all is the fingerprints easily left on the outer case. besides that this is a serious work laptop. super fast, super light & portable. love it.",0
"The computer is very sleek looking and heavy in laptop standards. You will probably need to get a cleaner due to how easy the screen and laptop leaves smudge marks. The laptop runs extremely well on Windows 10 and has a steel keyboard, which is a nice touch. The laptop has a variety of ports. If you need to use several usb ports you will need to get/buy an extra usb/port hub. This is my first laptop ever and it seem prett awesome. 4.8 stars!side note - I bought a laptop cooling fan in my pic. that does not come with laptop.",0
Great laptop for moderate work. I thought I was purchasing a touch screen. This is not a touch screen. Not great for gaming.,0
"For a slow web browser it works fine, I enjoy it use, me and my son playing d&d with zoom app, video communication is good, it nice it auto updates and I keep it running to watch YouTube or write with google online , I enjoy the product",0
"I get it, it's cheap. So, I'll put up with having to adjust the screen so I won't get a picture that looks like a negative, and the way that the opening screen when I use my Chrome browser is sometimes really small and has to be stretched out before I can use it. I'll use earphones to hear dialog on some movies because it doesn't do well picking up very low-volume sounds, like whispers.What drives me crazy is clicking on something, and then having things go screwy because sometimes my cursor is just a cursor-image and the actual cursor has moved elsewhere, like the upper left corner of the screen, or gets hung up some where until I release it for a few seconds, or like just now, playing a game, I click on a certain area, and I get sent to the exit page, even though I didn't want the exit page, and the area I clicked is nowhere near the area you click to exit. I tried re-starting the game, but it didn't help, I tried moving to another part of the touchpad, didn't work. I can't play the game if I can't access what I'm clicking on. WTF?",0
The product was received in good condition. Good size and also good quality. It worked well.,0
So far so good! Very fast.,0
DO NOT BUY A DELL LAPTOP. My top of the line XPS 13 failed TWICE within a little over 2 years! It won't turn on at all. First time it was a failed motherboard and I suspect this time around it's the same issue. Technical supports want more money from me to fix their quality failure. So do yourself a favor and go buy a Macbook. You pay more upfront but IT WORKS for many many years.,0
"Touchpad has given me issues, had to return once because it was completly unusable. I got a second one and the touchpad still acts up and can be unresponsive at times. Otherwise great laptop.",0
"Recd on time, works good",0
"the battery life is good, and it's not too heavy, it should also be a great all-around laptop.",0
Beware if u use sites like VUDU.com. I have over 40 movies on VUDU but can't watch on this. Apparently according to Samsung you can't download any apps or movies even tho you tube is already on here.,0
laptop is great and thin,0
"I liked the small form factor and sleek outward appearance of this laptop but have been disappointed with the performance, battery life, and how noisy it is. I can live with the battery life and performance issues, but the noise is really intolerable. I was replacing my old ASUS 17 inch laptop and wanted to order reasonably high end specs, but even though the specs are higher end than my old system, it barely seems faster, and at times there are inordinate delays in responsiveness. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised at the short battery life of the system because there isn't much room to fit a battery in such a small package, and that actually isn't that big a problem since I mostly use the system at home and can reconnect to power whenever I need to, but its still disappointing. I seem to get 3-4 hours from a full charge. The really annoying issue is that the cooling fan seems to run noisily when I am barely doing anything with the system, and once it starts running it doesn't want to stop unless I turn the system off. I regret purchasing this system and I haven't even finished paying for it yet.",0
It comes without much bloatware.,0

"I purchased this laptop to be used with iRacing (which is more simulation than game) and it has not disappointed! The graphics are excellent and the cooling fan noise (which others had complained about) has not been an issue. The system has nice cooling metrics and significant control over such things, but even at AUTO setting, I have been very pleased. I have not spent much time with it off AC power, so I cannot speak for the battery life, but it is not rated at a long time at all for modern laptops. Overall, I am very pleased!",0
"I needed a laptop that could withstand travel. I like the solid state hard drive, the slim profile and the matte screen.

"I purchased the 32-bit Samsung Chromebook 3. I wanted a Samsung unit to go with my Note 3, Note 4 and must recent purchase a Note 8. What great machine.. all for under $200! I charged it up and downloaded the OS update. I’m impressed with the speed, weight, and quality of this product. The fact that isn’t touch is okay with me. The mouse pad is very responsive and easy to use. I like the non-reflective screen, the screen brightness control makes easy to read in daylight. Instant startup is a joy. The USB 3 and second ports USB 2 and HDMI with the longest battery-life are what sold me. I wrote this review with the unit. Impressive, I'm a CHROME fan for sure. My favorite Play Store app - ISS HD Live.",0
Product was defective. I returned it to Amazon which never reimbursed me,0
Great computer for the money!!,0
"Loved many aspects of this laptop, but key shortcomings made it a deal-breaker for me. I returned it after a long trial.I currently use my 14” Lenovo X1 Carbon as my only computer. I travel extensively with it nationally and internationally. I use my laptop for heavy writing and editing, financial work, and photo editing. I almost always use it on my lap, versus on a table-top.The Gram 17” caught my attention due to the screen, weight, and battery life. I sometimes edit with two documents open side-by-side and the larger screen seemed ideal.What I liked: Screen size and sharpness, weight (although same as my X1), battery life, and much cooler running than my X1 (also the exhaust out of the hinge area moves the head away from my lap).What I didn’t like:Keyboard: The keyboard is critical for me. This was is substandard. Many keyboard shortcuts that involve one or two simultaneous button pushes on the X1 require three on the Gram. Why they consolidated keys on a computer with this much real estate is a mystery. The touchpad is centered on the entire keypad, rather than over the letters. I found myself regularly touching the touchpad and inadvertently moving things around by accident. Very frustrating. The idea of a dedicated number pad (as on this unit) seems absurd to me for general use, but definitely doesn’t work for a writer/editor. Bottom line: The biggest problem for me was the keyboard layout.Screen: The screen is highly reflective. I mostly work in natural light with a mirrored wall behind me. In strong daylight the screen can be very hard to use.Proprietary charger: My X1 has a USB C charger, which I can also use for my phone. The Gram has a proprietary charger. Complete wasted of an input.Size: For travel, this computer is just a little too big. Hard to get into a standard laptop sleeve and on airplanes would be hard to open with a seat in front of me. I sometimes work for hours on a plane and even my smaller X1 is cramped in some cases.Wobbliness: Because of the size of the screen, when using on a lap, the screen tends to waggle a bit. Not a huge deal, but it’s the nature of a light laptop and large screen.What would change my mind: If they were to redesign the keyboard to center it on the letter keys, perhaps dropping the right side number pad altogether, the greatest impediment to use would disappear. They could also spread out the keypad and reduce/eliminate the need for multiple key presses. The screen needs to be non-reflective. I would prefer a version with a 15 or 16 inch screen to reduce the overall size. They should dump the proprietary charger.",0
"I love it so far!!! It feels like a sturdy build, and I really like the thin screen bezels. Good sound, haven't tested it on really game intensive stuff yet but I'll be doing so shortly! I really like the RGB here too. Definitely a huge step up from my previous laptop.",0
"I have seen a lot of complaints about the cooling for this Laptop. While the base fan speed does in fact not work very well(but extremely quiet), the Cooler Boost 5 fan speed boost cools this Laptop quite well. On the first image you can see my temps(with boost) while working in Unity and Visual Studio. The 2nd screenshot is after running around in Destiny 2 in the Throne World of the new expansion. FPS never dropped below 90 for me no matter what I was doing. The majority of the time my FPS was well over 100. I say this because the 3070 inside this isn't a full power desktop style gpu(as stated in the product information above). It still performs quite well for what it is. The screen while a 1080p resolution is silky smooth with the 144MHz refresh rate. My desktop I use normally for gaming has Ryzen 3700x and an AORUS 1080ti . I actually prefer the laptopscreen over my desktop setup, but other than that I barely notice any differences in quality between the 2 machines.TLDR: Cooling has 2 modes(Quiet default and Cooler Boost 5[hit Fn + the Up Arrow to run] . Cools well even while gaming(with Fan Boost on) and excellent performance similar to my 1080ti desktop rig I normally game on.",0
Good fast laptop. Easy to upgrade the storage if you want.,0

"The letters on the keys were fading within a couple of weeks. It's more like a bad refurbished laptop than a new computer. I would have returned it if it wasn't that I needed something urgently and if it wasn't for the software I already installed which would have cost me. USB port did not accept my basic USB. Had to try multiple times to fit it in the port, and more. I used to be a HP fan but not anymore. Don't buy this product. Pay a little extra for something better. Trust me. I don't typically leave reviews for anything but this one was necessary.",0

I was looking for a laptop to replace my old acer that I had for 11 years and I was thinking of purchasing another acer. I took about a week before finally deciding on this laptop which was well over my budget but it was completely worth it. I was blown away by the specs and features that this bad boy came with. At the time of purchase this laptop was priced at $999.00. I thought it to be a bit over priced but for the specs and features the price was somewhat justified. This laptop has not dissapointed me a day yet since I had it. I really enjoy using my laptop and I'm always looking to find something to do on it. I've had this latop for just about 11 months and it still takes roughtly 5 seconds from pressing the power button to my desktop showing up. The finger print reader to logon is my favourite feature. i also love the display quality and brightness alot. I don't use the touchscreen much becuase my finger prints are highlighted because of the super bright and high quality display. I haven't had anything to do that really pushes this laptop to prove itself but so far it has worked super great. I would highly recommed this laptop becuase it stands out in all areas and is really an amazing device Acer has built.,0
"I like this laptop spec for spec but I am not sold on the 2-in-1 concept. Its nice to have to the flip and touchscreen option but I feel like I've outgrown tablets so this is not a huge selling point for me. It amy be for you.(+) Lenovo is a strong quality brand, and this machine 'feels' tough right out of the box.(+) I believe this Lenovo laptop will last a while given the 8th gen processor and build quality.(-) It's heavier and thicker than I would like though. I have a cheaper 15.6 inch Acer that is thinner and lighter. BUT I am guessing the touchscreen and metal casing is the reason why.(+) A majority of price tag is the Intel processor and SSD drive. In my opinion, you definitely do want the Intel processor but a 3 series is more than sufficient and the SSD is not required. In fact for Windows machines, I would argue you need the 1 TB hard drive to handle all the Windows 10 bloatware and updates.(-) Updates - yes a new Windows 10 machine sucks to get up and running. I spent a day with this laptop installing all the necessary updates.(-) It's unclear which Lenovo Active Pen works with the Flex series, (-) I downloaded the Flex 6 user manual to get more info on which Active pen to use, and on page 16, all it says ""Select model is equipped with the Lenovo Active Pen, to use it, refer to the following illustrations."" No reference to which pen works nor does the Lenovo website.I would buy this laptop but the cheaper version if and only if I was looking to consolidate my tech.",0
The charger of my newly bought laptop is making incredible noise and I couldn't get any help and they don't send a new one either.,0
"This laptops case is poor, thin and built incorrectly for women to see. Only the top of the case is proper.It feels like naked or too wide and made for video only.The keyboard is not good for games. It sticks at a bad ratio, and does not load 3D up to date.On the other side the 5 month payment for disability/welfare people or temporary work statements from disability is not good.1. food runs out of the house with over 100 dollar payments for 5 months2. pets become poor if they need food, dental or house care.3. medicine is only possible to buy at a low rate.4. wrong or poor choices can be made out of the ratio of SSI because of under throughput.The quadpay hangs with like a 160-170 overcast for 4 months instead which is on paypal on other sites like newegg.com or staples.comThey did not put the right model on this site with acumen as the pavillions are missing.",0

"the battery is junk. The computer arrived with a dead battery, charged it for 2 days, battery power went from 2% to 0",0
Nothing to not to like,0
"Very happy with it so far. Love the matte finish and coming from a Zbook 17, this is like a feather; super light, but without feeling flimsy. The three mouse buttons below the keyboard are absolutely make or break for me for two handed navigation so very happy here, though I do feel that it doesn't always register some clicks. Also a bit disappointed that the function and control keys, though swappable, aren't physically swappable due to the different key sizes (with the control key coming up short after the BIOS swap).Otherwise the battery life is fantastic, typing on the keyboard is enjoyable, and no complaints about the trackpad. The home and end keys, which I use frequently while coding, are in about a good a position as they can be I suppose, given the area limitation.Lastly, the IR camera for face sign in is a subtle but lovely feature that almost makes me forget that it's doing any ""signing in"" at all. After a couple of times registering my face, it's very quick at recognizing me.All in all very happy with the purchase and am enjoying going about as far on a single charge as I do with my phone.",0
"I have had the laptop for a month and have not had any issues. The unit showed very little signs of wear which is nice. For the specs, it is well worth the price. I like how the keys light up, it has been nice when in a dark room. It is plenty fast as well.",0
"This computer is cheap; I knew that going in but I was hoping that it would have basic functioning for writing. All I was looking for is a device that I could use to go to the coffee shop or library and write. This machine can't even handle that task. Not to mention, the resolution is horrible. It is unbelievably disfunctional. I will be returning this thing as soon as possible.",0
"I bought this computer specifically to play WOW (World of Warcraft) when traveling which does not clock a CPU like other games that I have played in the past. Even so, the CPU (AMD) in this lap top runs at about 80 to 85 degrees C in a room temperature of 70 degrees F. And boy you can hear those CPU fans pumping away. However, from a performance standpoint, it appears to be doing OK. Please also note that this is not my primary gaming rig which is a desktop. This is primarily for desktop down times and for when I am traveling.",0
Works fine for a cheap laptop. There isn’t enough space to down load even photoshop and you can’t remove the Xbox program included,0
"I did expect something amazing, and i ended up with a monster!This laptop is capable of intense gaming while doing other tasks such as music, video-editing, streaming, chatting, etc. It would handle almost anything with no issues at all.Pros:- 144hz Screen- Powerful GPU/CPU- Runs anything to be honest lol.- RGB Keyboard looks fancy and can be modified at preference.Cons:-CPU overheating. It's better if you get a cooling pad or something to help you out with the heat dissipation.- Speakers are not the best, but are decent.- USB Ports are located on the right side where you would usually locate your mouse if you are right-handed.- Fans might be a little noisy, easy to fix if you use headset (won't even notice).Design is good. It's thin and lightweight for a gaming laptop.Overall, a good laptop. Only thing you should worry about is the CPU overheating when there heavy-loads. But other than that, this is a beast!",0
"It came, and the laptop runs great, but the thing on the side that looks like a cd rom is not. Its a dummy.",0
"Now, I know the 3050 isn’t a “show stopping powerhouse video card”, but for the form factor, I find it sufficient in the only game I play on it (Genshin Impact) and runs well with good frame rates at nearly all max settings. I also use it for work and find it very easy to carry about and use as its lighter than a lot of other gaming notebooks. I don’t type for hours on in when I’m working on it so I find the battery life sufficient to me. Though if one is typing a lengthy report or writing a novel, one would certainly need to plug in at some point. I love the idea and the form factor of the ROG Flow Z13!",0
"NOT for people who need a serious laptop! There is no full Word version available for this Chromebook, and that’s my biggest objection. Memory is so limited, you must be a cloud-lover to embrace it (I’m not one).Gave this to my husband to Facebook and email with—it’s fine for that—and I bought a Lenovo laptop with 1 terabyte instead.",0
"I know it’s refurbished but it arrived looking like a beautiful brand new laptop. At first it was slow. I was thinking it’s so pretty, got to get used to it being slow. After all not brand new. But after spending a lot of time updating windows. It came to great speed. Lightweight. Doesn’t have overheating problem. Great screen, contrast, brightness. Love it.",0
"To be transparent - I bought the 14 inch version of this, same specs but a Ryzen 3 processor (comparable to this one). Initially, there was a problem with the screen dimming so much when I tried to work from the battery the laptop became virtually unusable. After a 25 minute call to ASUS, the problem was fixed. However I realized that in fixing it, I lost the battery icon and had no way to know how much battery I had left. That necessitated a second call to ASUS. Once we completed that call, the original problem of the screen dimming was back, so I called a third time and finally got a fix (had to go into the bios again). Was it worth the hassle - time will tell, I've only had it two days. As of now, it is sufficiently fast for basic office applications and for online activity. I do not do gaming and suspect you'd want a Ryzen 5 processor or better for real gamers. The speakers, which are located on the underneath and both sides, are just fine. The backlit keyboard is nice. The charging cable is really flimsy and I don't know why they would skimp there. It feels like it is well-built and it is attractive. If it hadn't been such a hassle, I'd be more enthusiastic. As it is, it is perfectly fine for my uses but I am still considering returning it, although I don't feel like starting the whole process over again. I'm cooked and don't want to have to think about computers for a long time! I knocked one star off for all the hassle, otherwise, for the price I paid from another vendor, it was great.",0

I like this chrome book but it is a little heavier than my old Acre. But for the price with 32gb memory it is worth the money.,0
"Bought my laptop a month ago and have been using it every day since. The overall quality is pretty good. I've been able to play all modern games with high quality (COD Warzone, Apex, F1 2020, FIFA 20). The screen quality is amazing! The temperature is also pretty decent for a laptop and the MSI Dragon Center seems to do a great job monitoring everything.The keyboard is also great, the only thing that I didn't like about it is the Windows Key only been present on the right side of the keyboard, which makes really hard to use common shortcuts like Windows+D really uncomfortable.I would also make a note about the sound quality that is not good. I found myself struggling sometimes with the audio volume and quality, it was also the reason why I bought speakers but I don't think its enough to take a star out of the review.I can say it was money well spent and MSI did a great job!",0
I’m so glad I bought this. I wish it were touchscreen but it works just fine and it came quickly,0
"I would be happy with this unit if the volume worked all of the time but I constantly have to restart it because the volume quits working. The first time it happened was right after the return window closed. I researched the issue and found out I have to do a factory reset. I did that the first three times and then tried just restarting and that works for awhile. This happens about once or twice/ week and is a real pain. If I had to do it over again, I would not purchase a Samsung Chromebook.",0
Powerful laptop that can handle music production and djing softwares without problems. This computer is so light and thin that it is unbelievable how well it works.There is no need to buy a Macbook Pro M1. Shop this one without hesitation.,0
"La laptop es muy bonita, pero la desventaja que le vi es que no se si no leí bien las especificaciones pero el teclado está en inglés por lo que usamos un controlador para ponerlo en espa?ol, la situación es que obviamente el teclado está diferente a cómo se usa en mexico por lo demás la computadora funciona muy bien solo hay que acostumbrarse al teclado, el procesador rápido y por el momento no he tenido mayor problema",0

"Okay, so I was hesitant on this laptop because some of the reviews mentioned bad temperatures. I was concerned with getting a laptop with bad thermal paste (which does happen). However, the laptop came super well! Lots of reviewers fail to mention the healthy temperature levels. Idle should be 30-45c. And under full load it should never go past 85c. EVER!!! If it goes past, it's likely it could either be, 1: Bad Thermal Paste/application, 2: Bad Fans, 3:Lack of contact with HeatSinks. 4: Bad Ventilation. If buying new, and the temps aren't matching, exchange it, as shipping can sometimes damage components. Laptops generally require maintenance. If heavy using, 1-2 Years. Make sure those temps never go past 85c. Over time you will have to replace the thermal paste or fans may give out. Grizzly Kryonaute is the best paste. Those are very very easy fixes. Just keep that in mind when buying ANY gaming laptop! If you are scared to tamper with it, buy some insurance and send it to acer. (Continuing with the review......) With poor ventilation I was reaching 85c. I bought a laptop cooler, the IETS with rubber rings. I'm getting incredible temperatures! Never going past 78c! This laptop is very heavy on proper Ventilation. If you look at the design there are a ton of vents from the bottom that push out through the top of the keyboard. S1I think a laptop cooler is necessary if you're gonna be gaming. This thing is incredible. I'm running games on High/Max settings (Elden Ring, warzone, apex) and getting awesome frames. I upgraded the ram to 32GB and this thing is a work horse. Dual rank 3200 32gb ram will increase your frames by about 15, and more opened tabs!! ;) I also installed a 2tb samsung ssd. (Which I highly recommend you do) It is much easier to install an nvme than the SATA one. So I would recommend getting a m.2 nvme. Opening the back piece for upgrades can be a challenge. There Is a trick to it, and it's likely you will break something if you don't get it right. So don't force it! So be very careful and gentle when doing it. Use a pick to slowly Pry it open. Pull from the vents back side. The battery can get kinda hot too. So make sure it's in a good spot. You can also set the battery charge level to 80% for longer battery lifespan. That's pretty much it! It's an amazing laptop for the price and power! Bang for your buck! Happy gaming!",0

"Overall purchasing experience was good, delivered in the expected time frame and perfect condition. Although amazon packaging seemed careless since it was not cushioned, I mean the laptop box was sent inside an amazon box with no shock proof protection as I have gotten with other not so fragile items, however the laptop box was in perfect condition, so the package management was good through the deliver.The laptop itself is a good trade off between power and price, there is enough CPU power to work on the go and just enough GPU for occasional gaming.Build feels great and robust despite being plastic. On the weight side is not the lightest of laptops but I guess is the price to pay in terms off cooling and CPU power as other similar laptops as lighter but with lower core processors.The fast charging is good, I got it full charge from ~40% in around 2 hours. FHD display looks good.On the bad side, the camera. Grainy image and bad quality overall, I'm not sure if it is a hardware or software issue, but I think Lenovo should improve this even for entry level laptops.",0

"Got this laptop and was very pleased. I was able to set things up but then the issues started. I could use the trackpad all day with no issues but as soon as I would go to use the keyboard, the computer would shut down. Sent the computer into Acer and they said the couldn't replicate the issue. I recreated it within 5 minutes of having the laptop back so I sent it back in. They ended up replacing the motherboard. But again, the issue still occurred after getting it back from Acer. Sending the laptop back for a refund because I'm done dealing with Acer. This laptop was beautiful and had great performance when I was able to actually use it.",0

"My worst computer choice since I started buying computers. There's been a never-ending series of problems, but here's a big one that forced me to buy another laptop. Power comes in through the USB-C ports (more on the ""C"" USB's later). The computer needed to be powered up, but the USB-C ports weren't working. I tried a half-dozen on-line solutions first, like reinstalling the USB drivers, etc. I believe a windows update disabled them, (and not just the USB 3.0's), because the problem happened after an update. (You can Google this problem...it's for real.) Either way, with no power left, I couldn't roll back the update, or keep problem solving. So no power, and no way to charge it.If I hadn't been fixing problem after problem with this laptop, I could research more and try to solve this new problem, but I've had enough. Consider: the camera is at the bottom of the screen. So if you're on zoom, you can't type without filling up people's screens with your knuckles and fingers typing away. Everyone on the other end had complaints or jokes about this. Ridiculous.Other problems: the fan revved up suddenly (overheating) and the laptop shut down. It's so fast you can't hit ""save"" on your work. Whatever you're working on is lost, or you're disconnected from a zoom meeting. Yes, I updated the BIOS and all the rest, and it seemed to help for a while but never stopped reoccurring. I reinstalled windows. On and on. I won't list all the other glitches, but once the problems started, I never had 2 days in a row that I was able to use the laptop without reinstalling drivers, updating from Dell, and so on. I've owned 2 Dell desktops that were great. One is 7 years old and still running. This is my first dell laptop, and it's my last.Last detail: if you need a regular USB port, my model didn't have one. Say goodbye to all your thumb drives, printer cables, unless you like cluttering up your desk with a hub, and want to drag a hub around with you in case you're at another location and you need to hook up to their equipment. And another tip: many hubs you can buy on-line won't work because they need more power than the USB-C will give them. Good luck picking the right one on the first try. Also, I went through 3 hubs and windows never recognized one of them, but ""luckily"" it worked most to the time anyway.",0
"This computer is good for the price, it’s hard to find a new computer with 8gigs of ram for under $400 so that is a great feature. I wanted something I could use for casual gaming and it does an acceptable job, nothing overly impressive the frame rates are pretty low sometimes on some games but low demanding games like Minecraft run well.The screen quality is fine, colors are a bit dull but in all honesty it’s not really a huge issue.One thing I will say is the computer does not have very much storage, if you are planning on using it for gaming buy an external drive to put the games on.",0

The build quality is very solid and much improved from the 2018 model.,0
This laptop has been amazing to game with. It handles everything I throw at it on the highest setting. The laptop handles well both plugged in and unplugged with the only drawback being the amount of noise the fan might produce. The noise has not been an issue as I only use headphones but others in the room will definitely notice. The RGB illuminated keys are nice and the built in software to customize the colors and bindings are a great addition too. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking at this price range.,0

Computer has completely died and wont turn on.,0
Great laptop and great value for money. Only one thing which i think might be software problem or something the wifi some time disconnects for few seconds then connect again (sometimes not automatically and i have to connect manually) i don't know why but only this laptop do it my other devices at the same time never did something like that. The other thing which isn't a big problem is when i use mute function key then try to raise the volume from volume up function key it supposed to unmute and raise the volume it but for some reason it shows that on screen but actually remain muted till i use the unmute function key (this only happens one time after u power up the laptop if u repeat it again it will unmute using the volume up function key) and that's it. Over all great laptop and i think those two problems are only in my unit or in rare units and might be fixed if i reinstall windows or with some sort of update it isn't a hardware problem i guess.,0
Showed a little more wear than I expected. Seems to work of.,0
"Just got this laptop and have been using it over the weekend. Forwarning, this may be long-winded.Update 10/6/2018: Still having touchpad failures, and now my bluetooth mouse is becoming disconnected. Turning the laptop's bluetooth on and off indicates the laptop is deciding not to see the mouse. Yet another problem with this computer. At this rate, I'll be unable to control the cursor with anything but the touch screen. Lowering the score a star.tl;dr/summary: Overall performance great. 4k monitor is the bees knees and also ankles. Style makes you look like a wealthy startup CEO. Obnoxious touchpad issues. Battery ""meh"". Runs hot but tolerable.First, of course is the display. 4k in a 15 inch screen is crazy. I can put my eyes up to the screen as close as I can focus, and can just BARELY make out the individual pixels. I bought this for photo editing so I think it will work well. I'm not quite sure on the color acuracy yet. Shortly after booting for the first time, I noticed the color temperature of the screen changed. I looked around everywhere for what might have caused it, but couldn't figure it out. Night mode wasn't on, adaptive bightness wasn't on, I don't get it. There is an Intel application for changing RGB hue and saturation, but it doesn't give the results I want. It's almost like the color temp of the backlight changed. Quite odd. Honestly though I wouldn't have noticed the change if I didn't see it happen. I am still confident that I'll be able to edit photos acurately. First thing I did when I booted up was open a white image to check for any dead pixels. All good!I briefly want to mention the color of this thing. Oh my god does it just ooze class. A bit of a fingerprint magnet, and the surface below the keyboard can look gross if you're typing (like I am right now), because the laptop is almost always warm and causes your palms to get a bit clammy. Thankfully, I'm not too picky about stuff like that and don't mind wiping it down every once in a while.Backlit keyboard is on point, and I like it just like the Asus laptop I used to own. They shine through under the keys with white, and the button lettering is like a light beige. I'm assuming if they tried to match the gold accents too closely, they would look like an ugly yellow. I think this color is quite good.Touchpad. I'll be honest, I have a huge problem with this thing. When moving the mouse around the screen, or scrolling, sometimes it just stops responding, or it will let me move up, but not down. I don't think it's lag, but for some reason it's just not registering my input. I ran through all the bases trying to troubleshoot this. Tried several drivers, checked to make sure windows gestures weren't interfereing, tried downloading Asus Smartgesture, tried cleaning it, and of course double checked that they didn't put some super-thin protective film on it. Still having the issue. I mean, I'm a mechanic by trade, but I by-no-means have grizzled old calused hands. I really don't think baby-soft fingertips should be a requirement for using the touchpad. This could probably be solved if there were a way to adjust the sensitivity of the pad. Asus customer support, I appretiate your assistance, but before you respond, I'm not talking about pointer speed. I mean the sensitivity of the touchpad registering an input. The sensitivity either needs to be increased, or give us a utility to increase it ourselves. That is, assuming that's the problem. My bluetooth mouse works flawlessly with no issues whatsoever, so it's undoubtedly a problem with the touchpad. Who knows, maybe it's just a problem with only my touchpad, but I really didn't plan on spending close to 2 grand just to immediately send it back, and possibly have the same issue. If anyone else has this problem, I would greatly appreciate if you commented and let me know how common it is. For now, it's not unusable, just occasionally quite frustrating.Battery. (update 9/18/2018: Have generated several battery reports that put the battery life around 4 to 4.5 hours of general web browsing and video watching) I haven't timed the discharge rate of it, but I'd put it around 5 hours just surfing the web and watching videos. Not great, but I'm by no means complaining. Driving a 4k monitor takes a lot of juice, and I probably wouldn't have an issue with the battery life unless it were under 4 hours. Bought this thing to be a powerhouse editor, and occasional light gaming computer. I would never expect to be able to to do those things all day on battery. That's just unrealistic. You might be able to increase battery life by setting a custom resolution of 1440, or 1080p, but I can certainly live with it right now.Noise/Heat. When I first booted the computer up, I was honestly surprised at all the noise it made. Fan noise is one thing, but this thing has so much coil whine when completing tasks that I took the bottom off to make sure I didn't get sent a unit with a traditional hard disk drive. Solid-state, and no moving parts aside from the fans, but this thing clicks and whines more than my $2500 desktop. It got a bit better once it wasn't constantly installing Windows updates in the background, but it's still there when under slight load. When you start to stretch it's legs, the fans spin up and sound like little jet turbines. A bit loud, but I wouldn't say obnoxious. In a busy environment, like a coffee shop, you probably couldn't even hear it. It definitely heats up though. The fans honestly do a great job at keeping the top of the laptop cool, but the cooling effects don't transfer to the bottom very well. When using it as a LAPtop, it will definitely keep you warm if you're taxing the system. It hasn't gotten so hot that I need to take it off my lap though. Handled Cities: Skylines okay so again I'm not complaining.Oh, SPEAKERS! Wow they're definitely the best laptop speakers I've heard, though it's not like I'm a laptop speaker tester. They have great bass that holds out until volume level 30-35 on Windows, after that, the bass stays the same and the treble just gets louder. For watching some netflix in your room, they're top notch. Playing some music while you clean your whole house, might want to get a bluetooth speaker. For entertaining a house party, that's a terrible idea and you're probably not a good DJ anyway.Overall, the touchpad thing is really my main gripe with this computer. My last laptop was an $800 Asus and I honestly had no complaints about it, so I was really expecting the trackpad to be much improved since the one I bought ~5 years ago.Can't think of any more topics to touch on, but please feel free to ask any questions. Not sure if Amazon sends notifications when someone comments, but I'll try to check every once in a while since I seem to be the only reviewer so far.",0

"Awesome powerful gaming system. It powers up fast and shuts down easily. Updating the graphics card is an easy step through step process when needed it. The design is awesome. I love the lit up features. It doesn’t come with a mouse, so order a good simple gaming mouse or you’ll be stuck with the mouse screen.",0
Very light and durable. Works at high speed and holds plenty of storage. I would reorder for my office.,0
After buying this POS laptop I will never buy dell again. It is no where worth the money spent.,0
"Simply put it's an awesome laptop. Fast great for games (I'm not a true gamer, but do play) light weight, easy to carry around. Looks good. Two things I don't like: one the RGB keyboard light software does not work. (AT ALL) I spent over 8 hours reading, load updates, reinstalling and so on. Finally gave up. Yes I even call and emailed support. For me this is not a real big issue as I set it to one colour and left it. Just a note I set it to the colour using the WRONG SETTING. It was the only way to get it to stay. Next the power cord plug. It's a little wiggly, makes me uneasy as I got this laptop to replace my last ASUS ROG LAPTOP witch died because of a bad power cord plug. The fact that it is on the side and not out the back doesn't help. All in all I give it a 8 and a half out of ten. Fix the RGB software and it gets a 9 and a half.",0

"This thing is so slow and the hard drive is always clicking, and the cooling fan runs about 65-75% of the time, even when it's just sitting idle. It is maddeningly slow. I've kept only six applications on this laptop (Skype, Zoom, facebook, etc) in my attempt to have a fast laptop, and even with just those it's so slow. The screen is dim on maximum brightness, the battery lasts less than four hours, the quality of playback using the DVD/ROM is substandard. I tried to exchange this for a newer, faster (more expensive) model and the seller told me too bad, it was beyond the period.",0

"I bought this simply to run my music library using MusicBee. Works fine enough just for that, except the space bar sometimes doesn't register and you have to hit it hard. After about six months, the middle of the keypad and the bottom part of the laptop had warped/expanded from heat so that it doesn't close properly. It still works but when I close it now, instead of going to sleep, it stays on -- so I have to shut it down completely after I'm done with it. Spend a bit more on your laptops instead of getting cheap plastic crap.",0

Otherwise, it scales back to 1440x900.The build quality is not very good and it’s easy to break.I had mine for 5 days and the keyboard keys stopped working, or work intermittently.Also, it does not use MagSafe, so there’s a possibility you can knock your MacBook Air by tripping on the charging cable.It also doesn’t support USB-A, so you’ll have to buy an adapter.",0

"Works like a charm so far. Battery life surprised me a little bit, set it up for a few hours unplugged and looked at it at only 87% afterwards. Good speakers / sound quality from what I can tell. Very lightweight.The main thing I was trying to figure out before buying this was the browsing speed and how fast the RAM would be. Answer: it's a new computer, don't expect it to be slow. You can browse the internet just fine. It's when you start adding a lot of apps (my friend has one and did that), that's when it will start to slow down. If you're just getting it for internet browsing purposes like me, and maybe 5-10 apps... you're good to go. Beyond that I can't speak for it, I don't know.Happy I bought it. Watch Youtube reviews, and learn the touchpad and hot keys when you first get it.",0

"I was pleasantly surprised when I got this. It can run all my steam games at max specs with no lag etc. The wifi card on this is also fantastic and also unexpected at how well it can keep up with my wifi's download and upload speeds.I like Lenovo because this brand has been extremely reliable for me in the past. My last Lenovo before this one (also a gaming laptop), is still running fine but I had to retire it because its specs could not keep up with the latest gaming requirements. I bought that one in 2013. It is also much heavier this one.I only really have two minor complaints:1)This laptop generates a lot of heat on both sides, but it's understandable considering its running 2 graphics cards and trying to keep its internal processors cool.2) The power cord is in the back and a little odd. It's easy to get accidentally detached depending on how you have the laptop situated.",0
"Every once in a while the laptop screen will go to a black screen. I am not doing anything that uses a lot of graphics but I had several tabs open at once. I also had an HDMI cable plugged in connected to my TV which was not fully on but in the off mode. What I learned just now is that I purchased this from Amazon a month ago and when I checked on line via HP, it came up as ""Warranty Expired Nov 29, 2019"" That figures I have a computer that is already a year old and out of warranty - and I start having issues! GREAT!! The black screen comes on for just a second, then it is normal again. This happened for the 1st time today while I was doing a long web search with many tabs open at once. I went and looked at the sleep timer settings and changed them but it did not seem to matter. Post doing that, I unplugged the HDMI cable. and a USB hub that powered my external drive and my printer and wireless mouse. Since doing those steps I have not seen the screen flicker to black? I will have to wait and see if it happens again, as right now it has not done it fro several minutes while I am typing this here. I stated earlier, it just started to do this today (out of warranty 2 days!), I will have to see if it acts up again later after I close tabs and reboot. I saw this issue posted on this forum a little while ago, and wonder if this laptop is a piece of crap or what? I had a Lenovo for over 5 years and never had an issue! I was reluctant to buy a HP from prior bad stories on them --- I pray I don't have the same nightmare starting here! ?? As I tried to explain --- when the screen comes back on it resumes to right where I left off. I am going to run MalWare Bytes and scan scanned for virus's . And yes, I have also changed the sleep and power settings to try and fix it. What is wrong with my laptop? Should I return it to Amazon now?",0

I tried streaming video to a Roku and it works well for that as well. I haven't experienced the problems that others have reported with the trackpad or fingerprint reader - both are working fine for me. Battery life has been adequate, but I'm not using it as a primary work computer.

"I ordered the XPS 9500 UHD+ model in mid January 2021 and still received a unit that had the loose/rattle-plagued touchpad issue. I returned it and ordered another thinking this to be a fluke, as the issue was supposed to be resolved. The issue touchpad issue was worse on the second model.Word to the wise: while the diving board touchpad mechanism is not going to be as rigid as Apple's Force Touch pad, plenty of other laptops have stable, rattle-free and firm touchpads ranging from Razer to HP to Lenovo. Dell's got to go back to the drawing board on the large touchpad built into the 9500. It's going to be something of a lottery with the possibility of multiple exchanges to find one that's suitable.",0
"To be honest I had my doubts on this laptop, but this thing surprised me. Starting off, the exterior is sleek. The top is smooth with pinched lines giving it a unique fee alongside the MSI logo that sits in the upper middle. The bottom ventilation is phenomenal. With a mesh underside that allows you to peer inside this beast of a machine, you’ll see exactly why MSI is a leader in laptop manufacturing. Transitioning to the inside, the screen quality is set to make gaming a blast. 1080p at 144hz is set to make any pro or frame rate enthusiast giddy. The keyboard is sleek and the RGB much appreciated, though it does have a tendecy to cave-in when you press down a little too hard, though generally the keyboard is more than serviceable. The mouse pad is a mouse pad. Not much to say here, especially since to a gamer it’s not much use anyways. The I/O leaves a bit to be desired. On the left side we have an ethernet port, HDMI, mini-DP, USB-A, USB-C, 3.5mm audio output jack, and 3.5mm mic input jack. On the right is your charging port, SD card reader, and 2 USB-A slots. The charging port is in an awkward spot, it overlaps where you’ll traditionally use a mouse. Same thing with any long cords you use on the 2 USB-A ports too. Now the actually performance of the laptop is impeccable. With a base clock of 1200 mhz and a boost clock of up to 1900mhz while using MSI’s Dragon Center, the 2070 Max-Q makes a surprising splash in the scene and dishes out insane performance. The i7-10750H comes in to hold up that performance with it’s 6-cores and it’s base clock of 2.6ghz that can boost up to 5.0ghz. Overall, this laptop is practically a steal at this point.",0

"We bought this laptop several months ago for teaching online classes and we couldn't ask for a better machine for the price. We are very impressed with the overall speed and function. It has a touchscreen which we have ended up using much more than we anticipated. It feels sleek and smooth and looks nice as well. We use it for a few hours a day and only have to charge it every couple of days. My only issue is the camera quality. Its not bad, but because we use it daily for work it is noticeably inferior to a more quality laptop computer (which was expected for the price).

It maxes at about 117-120fps.The internal storage is only NVMe only, so no cheap 2.5in SSD will fit. Expandable memory up to 32GB. Comes with 16GB installed and 528GB NVMe.",0
Why is the RAM for this not yet corrected. I would purchase this and expect a 1 TB SSD as it's clear on the product details that is 1 TB,0
Very clear quality screen. Battery is surprisingly long lasting. Safely packaged.,0
I received the laptop bag in very short time and it is a great addition for the laptop.,0
"Almost two weeks in with my new Lenovo Legion 5 gaming laptop and so far I'm quite happy with it. Only problems for me were some old outdated cables which caused connection issues that I needed to upgrade to with additional purchases on Amazon. Keep in mind folks, all the USB-A ports on this thing are 3.2 Gen1. You may or may not have problems trying to use older 2.0 cables. This laptop replaces an MSI gaming laptop that was a few years old and was beginning to have problems so I looked around Amazon and found this little affordable gem. Very happy that I purchased it. I like the 512gb SSD drive, very fast to launch programs including Adobe Creative Cloud apps. I'll add an additional 1tb SSD drive in the available slot in the near future but for now everything is humming along nicely. I added two external 27"" monitors, one via the HDMI port and the other with one of the USB-C ports. Both USB-C ports are Alt-Mode supported and are capable of transmitting video signals so you can add additional monitors via these two ports. I don't know if either USB-C ports are capable of using docks though. I'll contact Lenovo customer service to find out. For gaming I only have time to play a few AAA games, Star Wars Battlefront I & II (EA), BioShock games and the Age of Empires games (not the new AOE IV though, I uninstalled it after playing a few hours, I find the graphics terribly disappointing, awful for 2021-22). So all in all, very happy with my new Lenovo Legion 5 AMD Ryzen 7, 15"" gaming laptop.",0
"Within a few months of purchase there was a constant buzzing noise. Sent it in for service and after 2 weeks no response. Contacted service centre and they were waiting for parts (fan) - really? You don't have fans in stock when apparently this is a common problem (maybe that's the problem). Person on the line didn't really seem to care that we have been without laptop for over 2 weeks and didn't really seem to think that someone should be giving us updates (product was supposed to have been returned within 9 days) Lousy product, lousy company. Will never buy a Lenovo product again.",0
"I got this laptop(2060 SKU) in prime day deals and used it for 2 weeks now. Honestly speaking this device does have its own issues but most of them can be solved permanently or temporarily with fixes and workarounds. If you spend the time and tweak/tune it, its well worth the effort.Pros:- Very good and stable performance. 6 hours of gaming with no visible fps degradation. You need to put in another stick for dual channel though.- Chassis quality and hinges. It gives a premium feel overall. Very dense materials cause it to be much heavier than it looks. Solid and compact.- Nice panel, most units come with an AUO that has many calibration files over internet that u can apply but mine came with a similar quality LG panel. Unfortunately isnt as colour accurate out of the box. Still looks gorgeous in games, however.- Good keyboard if you can live with the gamer-y looks.Cons:- Asus bloatware. It hijacks your Windows Powerplan and causes kb rgb issues in some modes.- Some coil whine and backlight bleeding. But this is up to your luck and can happen with any other laptop as well.Other thoughts:- 2060 sku is much cooler than 2070. Mine hovers around mid/low 70s for both processors on average while running Witcher 3. Maybe low 80s on cpu for more intense games like BF 5. But many people complain about thermals in 704gw.- Myasus app allows you to change the battery charging profile. This can help with yor battery lifespan. Only useful software that comes with the laptop.- Amazon promotion isnt valid if you're not a US resident. Kind of a bummer but no big deal.Overall I'm happy with its performance. Runs cool enough so my Ocd self doesn't have to worry.",0

"We bought this laptop for my wife and she has been very happy with it. The screen quality is excellent, and the computer itself is thin and light.",0
"Ordered product in February 2019. Arrived quickly. After three months infrequent screen glitches occurring. Camera/webcam and microphone defective. Did not realize until end of March because had not tried to use before. Tried trouble shooting from web and contacting ASUS support, but no fix and will need to send back for servicing. Disappointing experience.",0
"I am sure the computer itself is fine. However, I only had it a month and it would not hold a charge. I sent it to Samsung for repair and they said nothing was wrong with it. Turns out, it is a faulty power cord so now I have to order another cord.",0
"when i first opened the box, you get 2 extra goodies- a carrying sleeve and an optical mouse!",0
"Well first, arrived on time. 2nd it's a worth the price and have been enjoying this laptop....no problem so far. Also I read a lot of reviews about adding more memory since I'll be gaming and purchased some Ripjaws 2 x16 . Battery is ok but it would be better if it lasted more than 5hrs ....even so it's not that big of a issue for me. Overall I'm happy with this laptop.",0

I've been ripped off and need a contact number so I can call to get hopefully get help ASAP. This is my first negative reply, i wish I didn't have you write.",0
I have had this computer for a while now and it has yet to let me down. I love it.I would recommend this as a college student.,0
"I bought this computer for my daughter to have a new reliable computer to use at college. We got it the second week of August but didn't set it up until the third week (just in15 time for her start). It worked until Sept 15 and then the hard drive crashed. Even though it worked less than a month, the seller refuses to replace it or do anything -- they referred me to Asus. Asus refuses to replace it -- only refurbish it. If I wanted a refurbished computer, I would have paid several hundred dollars less and bought one. Totally unacceptable quality and total lack of customer service.",0
That is ok but small size,0
I’m having a lot of issues with this computer. It won’t turn off. You have to hold the bottom a few times. I’ll be streaming something or working in a document and screen and sound goes crazy. I have to restart it but will loose everything that I was working on. I like the look. Wondering if I got a bad one. Hopefully the exchange is no problem,0
"The items is working so great, even in a way i didn't expect according to the previous reviews a saw i was afraid a lit tile bit but when i got the laptop it was instead working and looking good. i recommend it.",0
"Perfect PC for my teen - light and durable for school, and powerful enough to get through everything he is using it for, as well are normal gaming use (Roblox, Minecraft etc).The keyboard is well laid out and the backlit feature is awesome, and the connectivity is good too - the large number of ports (USB C and A, HDMI and Ethernet, 3.5mm Headphone) are good to have, and the Bluetooth and WIFI seems snappy and stable as well.Possibly, only criticism is that the audio quality from the internal speakers is awful - when compared by my old MBP at least - but using a Bluetooth or wired speaker or headset means you can avoid that anyway.",0
"I bought this laptop for two things: Photoshop and gaming. It does both excellently and not one part of me regrets this purchase. To me, it was worth every one of the many dollars I paid for it. I bought it in April and am reviewing it in December, and so far I've had no troubles whatsoever. When I was researching this laptop I was a little wary because I found a few reviews saying the hard drive would die after a month, or the keyboard stopped working, odd things like that. However mine is still running perfectly after all these months of regular, usually intensive sessions, and I see no wear or tear, no decrease in performance.The screen is very sharp and bright, the colours are all vivid and wonderful, so Photoshop is very, very nice with this screen. As are my photos, nature is bright, macro shots are sharp, everything looks perfect. The viewing angle and anti-glare features are also just as nice as advertised.The keyboard is very nice feeling to click, and quieter than many. Some complained about the number keys at the side and a few other buttons there being awkward or uncomfortable to hit, but either it's not really that big of a problem, or I've adjusted to it. The mouse pad feels nice too, and has physical buttons to click instead of just relying on tapping. The keyboard lights up and gives you many options for how it does so, and is very appealing. It can be turned off if you prefer.I love the dedicated button for the gaming center, it's nice to check instantly how hard it's working or how hot it's getting. Which brings me to the next point and my only minor issue with the laptop: it gets hot during intensive gaming sessions. Not so hot as to burn you (as some dramatic reviews in various places claimed), but it does make me worry for the innards of the device. Remedied by placing a small tabletop fan beside the laptop to blow away the hot air and provide slightly cooler air for it to breathe. Reduces the temperatures enough that my concerns are lifted. Yes it's inconvenient if you want to bring it along places, lugging the fan around, but it's worth it to me. And when you get a thin laptop like this, you need to expect some heat.With the fan on it hovers between 75-85 degrees Celsius, and I've never had an issue with throttling or slowing down due to heat during a gaming session (Ark for example) and get a steady 95-115fps, usually around 105fps. It's been a long time since I played without the fan so I don't remember the exact fps (I think it was around 85) but I do remember that it still didn't lag or throttle, despite reaching 85-95 degrees Celsius. It never reaches 60 degrees as far as I have seen doing anything else, including Photoshop. So cooling ideas would only need to be considered during gaming. Headphones are recommended if you do as I do with a little fan.It does get somewhat loud and noticeable during gaming because the fans are working so desperately to cool the laptop, but if you don't have a little fan you don't really hear it through headphones. I'm not picky so maybe it's horribly loud, but if you aren't picky or plan to wear headphones too, it'll probably be just fine. During any non gaming activity it's quite enough that you start to wonder if it's even on.The battery life is quite sad, I never bother to unplug it so I can't give you any hours counts but it's not the greatest. For normal use it is okay, but not for gaming. If you are playing without plugging it in, the gaming aspect of it takes a hit. Playing Ark without having it plugged in will have the fps suffer greatly after a little while as the battery is quickly drained. Not a big deal though.Some quick pro/cons:Pros:-Beautiful screen-Very quick-Quiet-Nice keyboard-Plenty of connections on either side-Great at gaming with high fpsCons:-Battery life-Heating during intensive gaming (though expected from how thin it is)-Fan noise during intensive gaming if you aren't wearing headphonesOverall, I have no regrets buying this laptop, it's working perfectly and was worth the chunk of change paid. I would recommend it.",0
Complete POS! Not even a year old of very little use and it will not charge!! Junk!!,0
This laptop is easy to work on. The screen is large and resolution is exceptional. Battery lasts for 5 hours of hardcore continal use.,0
"Purchased this laptop in Mar 2020 and in the first 2 months of warranty it randomly would restart about once a week. Then over time it started randomly starting with no error message and when calling into customer support they have not resolved the issue even with the new Windows updates and running diagnostics tools and whatever else and ensuring all firm ware was updated. This is a headache to deal with and now it restarts randomly without notice usually in the afternoon between 2 and 4 pm. I have about 10 google chrome tabs only one of which is YouTube and will have Microsoft Word sometimes (even when not it restarts), along with some desktop applications which are low on the processor. Now i'm out $1600 with a defective product that interrupts work flow in the middle of the day. THis is a known issue as over 150 have complained about this and it's suspected that it has something to due with the Ryzen processor as some have exchanged it for one with an Intel processor. BEWARE and get the Intel processor even if it's a little more.",0
This laptop is completely trash it keeps freezing and wont let me put my pictures on it,0
This computer has been barely used by me and won’t even stay on without being plugged in. The bottom of it also has become swollen or enlarged,0
I've only had it this laptop for about 4 days now and it's working really nice as a low-mid ranged Gaming Laptop which is fine as I purchased it primarily for classes with the ability to run games on my off time which so far so good other than it sometimes feels like I'm fighting with the keyboard. If I'm not pressing with decent force it'll ignore the key about a fourth of the time. Hoping I can find a setting or something to adjust this,0
It is very fast.Furthermore it is Great value for price.It is so light and so good for paper working and for internet searching.,0
This is the first laptop i have bought in years and after a ton of research i can sleep knowing ive made the best choice ! I am more of a console gamer but bought this laptop to also play a few games i enjoyed playing on pc when i was younger as well to use just for daily entertainment. The laptop looks amazing and runs just as great. I bought both the heavy duty case and mouse that are compatible to the laptop and all together each product have me head over heals in love with the laptop. I have been showing it off on social media and the feedback have served as just more reinsurance that I made the best choice!,0
"I received this laptop as a gift in 2017, and for the past 5 years it has only exceeded expectations relative to the price. I mostly play fps titles such as siege and Overwatch, both of which run smoothly. Using a bit of DIY skills the useful lifespan of this laptop can be extended by years. About 2 years in I added RAM, 4 years in a repasted the chips and all thermal throttling went away. Recently, I built a new PC in order to have hardware with a clear upgrade path, but my laptop is still perfectly acceptable for running every game I am interested in five years later (with a few minor upgrades/repairs. ). The only con is the battery life, but that was never an issue for me as almost all public spaces in 2022 have easy access to outlets.",0

I bought this for my teenage daughter to use for high school. All in all this is a very good and affordable computer for school use. I was not too concerned about the 32G storage since I gave her an external hard drive to store her files on when it is not necessary to have them located on the computer's hard drive. I would certainly buy this again and probably will when the next kiddo reaches high school.,0
"La laptop es de muy buena calidad, el unico fallo que le encontre es que el wifi se desconecta de vez en cuando, pero actualizando los drivers se soluciona",0
I know nothing about technology but it was been a 99% great experience as for it being smooth and running well. My only issue is that the audio has been terrible ever since I took it out of the box. Great for college students though.,0
"I have nothing bad to say about this laptop yet, although I have not had it for that long. I can say I love the keyboard great feel and response. The screen also looks quite good. And so far it has run ever program without any trouble at all so definitely powerful enough for almost every video game at the moment. I have WOT running right now along with eight tabs of chrome, and can't even tell the difference. I did take off the bottom cover to add another hard drive. It is hard but doable. Just start at the corners under the screen and make sure you get the right storage. The only thing that I do not love so far is the trackpad, but who uses that on a gaming laptop. The fans can also get very very loud. The only other thing I have to say is that I like all dragon center as a computer control center. So for me, it has totally been worth the money.",0
"I think this would be a great machine if mine weren't defective. It's been blue screening since I got it. Finally found out that it has bad ram. Was going to reseat the ram to make sure it wasn't just in wrong, but this laptop doesn't give you easy access to it. Now I have to send it back to the manufacturer and pay for my own shipping to get something fixed that was bad from the factory. Not impressed with the customer service for sure, but the laptop, when not getting a blue screen is an absolute beast. Knocking a star off my review for the issue I'm having and the bad warranty policy.",0

"Good machine, well made. The empty hard drive caddy doesn't fit my standard laptop HDD. There is a lip on one side that doesn't allow the mounting screws to line up. The gaming performance is good for the price. It's a clean design. Possibilities for expansion is good. Asus doesn't have good access to maintenance documentation. I'm used to Lenovo where the repair and assembly documentation is readily available. Makes finding parts a pain. Overall, I'm so far very happy with it, aside from the little bumps I mentioned. Having to modify the HDD Bracket is disappointing and a pain.",0

Even though I just got it for virtual schooling during the pandemic, I couldn't even use it for that. So it's essentially the equivalent of a brick (but at least a brick serves its intended purpose).",0

"Had this laptop for a while now and am generally pleased with it, especially compared to my old laptop (competing brand) which finally started failing after about eight years.This is a very well designed laptop with all around great components. I mostly stay plugged in so I can't comment much to the battery life, but the drain from the 144hz screen along with the power hungry 2070 and 10th Gen i7 is about what I would expect.Feels solid and easier to carry that my old laptop in the same class. If you plan on doing heavy processing in class the cooling system will be disruptive, but for my applications I appreciate the adequate cooling.I'm a software developer and find the laptop overall great with the smooth text rendering and comfortable keyboard. I also greatly enjoy my audio experience and was surprised by the very well driven headphone out that I normally use an external DAC and amplifier for.I ended up removing all of the bundled software which caused a very noticeable performance drop on the system and some minor annoyances (dragon center autopinning namely).Overall I would definitely recommend this system to others. I think it outperforms its price point, especially for the good details.",0

"Disclaimer: I bought this at walmart in store, not amazon. I'm not faulting the vender, just the manufacturer of the product.I know a bunch of you guys are raving about this product because you had it for years, but the newer ones do not last long at all. I had it for 3 months (the date it was made was 12/16, I bought it 02/17 and it wouldn't work on 05/17). I took excellent care of it before the battery would no longer charge. There's nowhere to buy the battery either, unless you want to go straight to the manufacturer and buy it for $50. I was thinking that I wouldn't need the warranty when I moved so I tossed it, before I had problems with it. That was a huge mistake. If you decide to buy it, keep the warranty. I'm not sure how they deal with fixing or reimbursing their products. I just don't want anybody who buys this from amazon thinking amazon is purposely sending faulty product. I've read countless reports on the newer ones having battery problems, so it's not just me.",0

"I bought this base model Macbook air M2 to replace a 2017 Macbook Pro 13"" with an Intel i5 2.3 and it is somewhat snappier in performance. Menus and webpages open faster. The keyboard has a better feel to it than my 2017 MB Pro. The magsafe charge connector is far better than usb c. The finger print reader is a bonus for logging into APPS and websites. I bought the Starlight colour and glad I did. For those of you who said in your review that you bought startlight colour Mac but got a silver one....you probably got startlight colour. It's very hard to see that there is a hint of gold in the colour until you sit it beside a silver Mac. I bought the base model with 8gb ram and 256 gb HDD because the bulk of my use is web surfing and I don't store many photos or videos on my Mac. Battery life is a lot longer than my 2017 Intel i5 MB Pro. When using this Macbook Air M2 for web surfing, the battery dropped only 10% after 1.5 hours. Overall I'm happy with this MB Air M2 and would recommend this base model for the average user. Buy yourself a nice sleeve or other accessory with the money you save by buying the base vs upgraded M2 Air.",0

"This review is from: ASUS M580VD-EB76 15.6"" Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 16 GB DDR4 Memory 256 GB SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming LaptopPros: Background: I bought this to replace my aging 5 year old (Bulky/Heavy) MSI laptop with a 660M. Set up was relatively fast and I got most of my files and settings set up in around 2 hours on and off once Windows 10 was done downloading and installing updates. Onto the physical bits:-The computer is extremely thin and light like the product description suggests. Build quality is quite good and the plastic bottom could have fooled me for how solid it feels. I could go on for days how much nicer using this laptop is than my old MSI.-Speakers are a mixed bag in that at proper (i.e. lower) volumes they sound super clean and wonderfully full especially when voices and speech are concerned. I'd say they are better than they are worse so long as you adjust the volume to suit whatever you are listening to, as they tend to distort easily on higher settings. By far the best laptop speakers I've heard under the right conditions.-The specs for this computer looked good on paper and play good in practice (so far). Boot up from fully shut down takes around 5-8 seconds to the login screen which is faster than my desktop. The 1050 inside is able to play last gen titles well like Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin and so on at full HD with no issues. I haven't tried pushing it with more demanding titles so that might be updated later on.-Wireless is extremely fast with no latency or issues.Cons: -Keyboard is kind of squishy if you ""really"" push down on the keys with a small amount of flex on the surrounding area being depressed but unless you like to smash the keys when you type it's perfectly serviceable with decent feedback.-Screen has sweet spots and the viewing angle can wash out colors quickly if you aren't looking at it dead on. Not a deal breaker but noticeable.-Fan noise is noticeable when running benchmarks, but I guess that was expected. Could be worse.-Battery life is not amazing but it charges quickly.-Stuck with the 1050 instead of a 1050 ti or 1060 variant, couldn't find a higher spec'd GPU on the Vivobook line, which is a shame as I'd have gladly paid a bit extra for some more power.-Some bloatware from ASUS but nothing that couldn't be removed with minimal effort.Other Thoughts: -I would recommend this model if you are looking for a very professional looking laptop for work with the ability to stretch its legs and do some decent gaming on the side. I primarily got this for travel and for its form factor/styling, as it doesn't scream ""WOW LOOK AT ME I AM A GAMER LOOK AT ME"" like most competing models seem to flaunt with horrible aesthetics. For $999 (at the time of this review) and the performance/form factor this laptop is in a very specific segment that I wasn't able to find anywhere else for the relative cost, especially with it having a 7700HQ and 256 SSD AND 16 Gigs of ram AND the 4 Gig 1050.-My only concern with this product was heat from the GPU and if the design could cope. Will update when I have more results. Dark Souls II didn't push the GPU too hard from what I could gather.-I would give this laptop more like a B+/A- if the scale permitted more nuance, particularly with the screen being so picky for viewing angles. ASUS has made a great product and I look forward to taking this with me around the world and where my job requires me to go.",0

"I bought this laptop for my daughter to use for online learning and after a year of use, it is a complete piece of garbage. At first, everything was fine. However, now there is a dark mark at the top of the screen that just appeared out of the blue. While using Google Meets, it is SO slow. After clicking on something it takes forever to respond. When turning on her camera, it works when it wants to work. All and all, I have to purchase another laptop for my daughter. I will never buy another Dell PC for my daughter again.",0

"It boots quickly, and it runs fast.",0
"Performance-wise, the laptop is outstanding. I've not had a problem with anything I've thrown at it thus far, be it downloading, moving files around, using external hardware, or streaming videos.However, there are two design issues that cause a not inconsiderable degree of frustration: the delete key is adjacent to the power button, and each are the exact same size and shape. Many times when I go to delete something, I hit the power button. It's a small inconvenience, but annoying, and could have easily been avoided.The second issue I've encountered is that the touchpad vacillates between oversensitive and under-sensitive without warning. Dragging the mouse around can be a chore, or it can jump around the screen with little to no warning.Other than those two issues, I'm happy as can be with the product. Would very much recommend if you can deal with those two flaws.",0

I am very pleased with my purchase!,0
"I bought the 4GB RAM Quad Core version but I had it only for almost a month before I returned it. The reason is I found a Chromebook with a larger screen -- a 15.6-Inch Acer Chromebook 15 CB5-571-C1DZ. In the time I had this HP Chromebook, I really put it through its paces by using it 6-8 hours a day, 5 days a week.I've had no Wifi or lag issues that a lot of people have complained about.The Wifi connectivity was rock solid with no intermittent breaks in connection and I was using this Chromebook for hours at a time. I didn't have any issues with lags either, even with multiple tabs/windows open. I used it a lot for video streaming and for remotely controlling my home computer -- no problems at all. The video streaming was very smooth.The battery life was also very impressive. I frequently ran it down from a full charge to 20% charge and I got at least six hours of use every time. I never had to run it down all the way because I didn't need to. It also recharged very quickly (about 2-1/2 to 3 hours from a 20% charge to a full charge).The Acer Chromebook was a better fit for me because it provided a better audio and visual experience. The Acer had louder speakers and, of course, a larger screen. You wouldn't think 1.6"" would make a huge difference, but it does. The larger screen means bigger text, which means Documents/News Articles/Email and other materials are much easier to read.Let me be clear: the 14"" screen is by no means a knock against this HP. The smaller screen allows it to have a smaller form factor. It is also very lightweight and well built. It feels very portable and it feels good in the hands. It sits nicely on your lap if say you need to type up a document or browse the Web while you're using public transportation.If you need a nice, compact Chromebook and don't want to have to lug around a behemoth, this HP is definitely worth consideration.",0
No complaints.,0
"Excellent laptop for everyday use!Definitely recommend it.""I am receiving points in the ROG Elite Rewards loyalty program for my review""",0
"I have had this computer for about 4 months and it randomly stopped working. I bought it brand new. All of my icons were gone and the screen was black except for the task bar but it did not function and I still had a recycling bin icon, but when i clicked on the recylcing bin it said the location did not exist. I tried to restart it and now it wont turn on at all. Im super bummed because i really loved it when i first got it! It's been used a few times a week but no misuse at all and has not left my apartment since I got it, so I dont believe the error was from anything i put it through. Over all i would not purchase this item. All my documents i had on there are now gone.",0
nothing like getting a deal from amazon on these latest generation products.,0
Well i was Searching for a good gaming laptop and i had to make it sure because i had to work hard for an year just to save up and so i did research for like 6 months on what gaming laptop i should go for and yeah i found the Asus rog strix scar 15 but still i wasn't sure. So i waited long enough to finally fix my mind and went through and bought this laptop and wolah this thing is a beast. This laptop is Everything i expected it to be actually more. From the design to performance everything is top notch in my opinion and i never been so hyped and happy. Any game i throw at it runs smoothly without any problems and yeah the RGB linings are so good. I am really glad i bought this laptop and i would totally recommend this to anyone out there : ),0
Minor light leak when system is totally black.,0
Good as new. Clean and scratch-free. Great deal.,0
Boots up / shuts down quickly.,0
Gift to my wife and uses it every day,0
"Just got my laptop today. So far, so good. Very fast. Battery life is nice. Sleek design and it is lightweight, so it will be great for school and travel. Screen is solid. Again, just got this today but this appears to be an excellent value. If you want further validation, look this product up on Best Buy. The reviews for this are very good. Overall, I am impressed and hope to use this for several years.",0
Everything on point. Hope it stays that way,0
"This laptop has everything you will need to game in high quality and in VR. You will definitely hear the fans especially during the Cooler Boost 5 feature. However, rest assured it will probably never get dirty inside if you game often and/or run the Cooler Boost 5 from the button on the keyboard. Some people have reported that changing out the CPU thermal paste helps keep temps down but that is risky if you haven't done this many times. Other than running a bit hot under load and very powerful fans, you won't find a better 15"" laptop for the price.",0
"The screen for this product broke within 9 months. I contacted ASUS customer service since it was still under warranty, I was told it would take 10 days, at most to fix. That was 75+ days ago. After speaking with multiple customer service agents, they cannot locate where my laptop and are not offering a replacement. The customer service has been HORRIBLE. Don’t expect the laptop to work for a year or for ASUS to fix the problem. I wish I would have bought a laptop from a different company. Save your money and the frustration. Stay away from ASUS",0
Great Quality!,0
I got this Chrome Book for my Daughter for Christmas and it would not turn on because 1. I did my Christmas shopping more then 30 days prior to Christmas and 2. Dell is stating Amazon had this product since July so I do not even have the full warranty Dell says its Amazons problem not theirs Amazon and Dell will not Replace the item. It has to be sent in to the factory which will take 2 weeks to repair. Don't even waste your time and money with this product I do not recommend Dell Chrome book or Amazon for Computer purchase since. you do not receive full warranty time protection.,0
Can't run sketchup properly. Freezes up on the first go. Should not be happening. Sketchup is uses the same amount of power as a video game. I will never buy Lenovo/Legion again. Waste of my time.,0
"Bought this computer for both gaming and college, every game I play runs on ultra (Overwatch, WoW, GTA, Battlefront) It gets a little heated sometimes, 80 degrees Celsius, but Im gonna get an Opolar laptop cooler one of these days. Strats up in 2 seconds, fast, no complains so far",0
Good little laptop for the money. Screen is clear and bright. The brushed chrome is a little rough. Wish the battery life was longer. Good buy.,0
Battery life is about 4 hours after 8 months old,0
"We have many chrome books in our household and this has been the worst one. The performance has been mediocre the most since we bought it a year ago. It has been always slow and laggy. And the quality always felt quite cheap. So today, the monitor stopped working. Basically made it impossible to use the laptop anymore. We ended up wasting 300+ dollars. Not happy at all. I’d say stay a way from it unless you want to waste your money.",0
"Arrived without WIFI Capabilities. Sent Replacement Computer which arrived next day. Using for 9th Grade HS classes. Light Weight, Awesome Keyboard. Good Graphics. Battery lasts about 3-1/2 hours. Recommend Seller.",0
"We bought this and everything works fine, but there is NO DVD player as described and pictured, which is why we picked this specific laptop.",0
"I use this laptop as a platform that runs to a hub. The hub operates two monitors, two printers, a backup external drive and a host of other items. It's fast and efficient. Plus if I want to unplug to take it with me, it is so portable. Cool.",0
Fast and perfect price for package and products.,0
Love the laptop,0
The SSD is expandable if you're willing to take a heat gun to it and open it up,0
I love the fact they removed the Windows key from the WASD side of the keyboard,0
Within a few minutes of starting a game the laptop freezes and has to be manually restarted. Happens multiple times before I can actually play a game.I'm still searching for a solution.,0
"Great little laptop for basic needs! My husband has an HP Omen for photo editing and things like that, I was just looking for something small to surf the web and respond to emails. This is perfect. I've only used it for a few evenings, but so far it's well worth it's reasonable price tag!",0
Just getting used to it.,0
"it took a little while to get use to the key board,",0
"Me gustan las características de la maquina están por encima de lo que realmente necesito: procesador de 12va generacion, GPU que me costara explotar debidamente ram mas que suficiente y con opción de expandir igual que la unidad de almacenamiento para un gamer aficionado editar videos a nivel y office muy básico sera una laptop que durará muchos a?os sin necesidad de cambiarla. el precio es muy justo tenia dudas, todas las rese?as hablan de lo terrible de la pantalla para mi luce muy bien solo me deja deseando que no tenga HDR y en efecto la batería es peque?a solo terminaría diciendo que la apariencia que algunos les parecerá simple yo la encuentro muy elegante y su teclado me es muy agradable.",0
"Purchased this for my grandson, his first notebook. He finds it very easy to use.",0
The laptop came on time and in great condition. The screen quality is better than I expected. Not to mention the speed. I love this laptop. Its more than an upgrade from my previous one.,0

"speaks don't work very well, issues with hearing youtube videos, sound quality poor",0
"Super molesta con este equipo, las especificacionen no cumplen con lo que sale. Primero dice que es teclado iluminado. Y es mentira y lo otro que es nuy inportante dice que el disco es ssd y en realidad es hdd. Esto es una publicidad enga?osa. Y exijo de verdad que me devuelvan mi dinero.",0
"Great machine, arrive fast and easy. Never a problem with latest games. I love it.",0
"A friend of mine helped me browse for a new gaming laptop, and for my budget and specifications, I needed this beauty to really fit all my needs. I wanted to wait till Black Friday but for the price range and power, I couldn't wait any longer so I purchased this I don't regret it at all. best gaming laptop I ever purchased other laptops I compared with the same specs didn't come close either its lower graphics or Gigs or an older generation or lower core inside. that is why I chose this among 10 other ones I was looking at it is so worth my while I am enjoying every second of it the keyboard lighting is so pretty and finger placement during gaming is so comfy it is very intuitive design.",0
"I have relied on HP for years. I bought this for my son and it's perfect for his use! Easy to use, easy set up. He's a happy camper!",0
Great laptop but I would suggest upgrading wireless card.,0
"La computadora tiene buenas características para su precio y un bonito aspecto. Sin embargo, mi computadora llegó defectuosa, con una bocina que no funciona. Seguro no es el caso de todos los productos, pero ocurre y las opciones para resolverlo habiéndola comprado en Amazon México son limitadas. Primero que nada es una gran frustración haber comprado un producto de este precio para obtener algo defectuoso, sin importar cuán mínima o grande sea la falla. Las únicas opciones que uno tiene al verse en esta situación implican una pérdida de tiempo y son: Devolver el producto o intentar hacer válida la garantía con Asus. Sin embargo, estas dos opciones tiene un gran PERO cada una; Al ser un producto importado, la devolución no considera el costo de importación, lo que resulta en una pérdida de al rededor de 3000 pesos automáticamente en caso de devolverla. En caso de querer hacer válida la garantía tenemos el mismo problema, ya que la razón por la que es importada es porque en México no se vende este modelo. Por eso mismo, para hacer válida la garantía uno debe gastar aún más en envío a EUA y atenerse a disponibilidad.Dado que es un producto de importación, la posibilidad de que tenga un defecto hace su compra a través de Amazon riesgosa y en mí ha generado mucha desconfianza para potenciales compras futuras.",0
"We bought this for the most recent school Covid closures last January, and to have as a backup. Definitely nice for a Chromebook. If you Google reviews on this model, you'll see it's highly regarded. But don't expect any wow factor such as a high res screen, it's simply a dependable and reliable product for the price.",0
I love this laptop (MSI gs65 stealth thin) because of its usability in college/school and it's amazing gaming performance.,0
I purchased it less than two months ago and the screen was broken (only shows several colorful lines and it is not due to any physical damage).,0
"This is a great laptop that is well built, light, and reliable. With the Chrome browser, I don't even miss my old windows laptop. As long as you access a good internet connection you should'nt have a problem easily surfing the Internet even with multiple browser tabs open.",0

"Delivery good, product looks good. Unfortunately when I turned chromebook on a message said this is last update you will receive, AUE expired.

Small and neat and works great,0
The battery is really bad it lasts only 2 hours for new PC is really bad,0

"I am a nursing student, and my old laptop (a Lenovo yoga) finally died on me after so many years. I needed an upgraded laptop for starting the nursing program. I did lots of research on various laptops that are great for students and I could not have chosen a better laptop. Although the laptop takes a few weeks to get used to, the keyboard set up is a bit different (nothing that causes any difficulty typing) and the screen is fairly large. The large screen works in my favor. I have the ability to split the screen between two windows, so I can simultaneously write my papers while referencing the article all in one. The memory on this laptop is amazing, and allows me to save my files in any form (pdf,word,open document,etc) making submissions for various classes easy. The fact that this is a google computer is one of the main reasons i love it so much. I have everything I need readily available and Google makes this a laptop that is super easy to navigate. 10/10 would recommend to any student. I'm not sure about gaming capabilities or anything outside of my academic needs, but I can't imagine that there is anything this laptop can do well.",0
The whole keyboard operates smoothly and I like that the mouse pad,0
"Shortly after getting this laptop as a gift I started to have random blue screen crashes when waking it up from sleep mode. I could never identify the cause and ended up just dealing with it for a while until slightly more than a year after receiving it when the screen just shut off completely randomly and wouldn't turn back on again, only displaying over HDMI. I tried everything I possibly could without replacing parts (disconnecting and reconnecting the battery/CMOS battery/RAM/screen, updating video drivers, rolling back last windows update) but nothing worked or even shed any light on the problem. Also note if this happens it's impossible to access the BIOS because it can't display over HDMI, thus making it even harder to try and fix the issue. I have never had a laptop randomly break after such a short time, so I can only assume there's a problem with Acer's quality control.",0
Nice computer for the price. You will run out of memory very fast with updates alone so make sure you pair it with an external drive.,0
The base clock processor speeds are too low.,0
"Todo impecable, artículo nuevo, desempe?o espectacular y la calidad de la pantalla es increíble.En momentos de exigencia gráfica suena relativamente fuerte pero es comprensible en sesiones más extensas de juego.lo recomiendo a ojos cerrados, impecable vendedor.",0
love the size and the speed,0
La batería dura mucho,0
"I've had this laptop for 3 months now, so here goes nothing.Pros: excellent machine. It's super fast, easily keeps its framerates up without trying, has a battery life unlike any laptop I've owned before, and honestly it has just enough of that ""gamer aesthetic"" to look cool without looking like Megatron's codpiece like most other gaming laptops these days.Cons: the built-in monitor is a 60Hz display, so your framerates aren't going higher despite it easily having the spare power to do so with a better monitorThe legion logo on the back of the screen that lights up cannot be turned off, so if you play in a dark room and prefer doing so, prepare to have a beacon in the middle of your room.It's kind of a nitpick, but the soft touch material picks up oils from your skin and smudges really easily. It's not hard to clean, but it does make me add a step of ""wipe this thing down"" before packing it up to go to a friend's house, which is a minor annoyance.And now for the only real problem I have with it. It severely limits how much power the GPU can use if it's on battery. I'll be at a static 60 frames, and checking my stats, the GPU isn't taxed AT ALL with a handful of modern games, but then if the computer becomes unplugged, it locks the screen at 30 frames per second. I can tell that it doesn't seem limited to games either, because something seems slightly off with my otherwise vibrant display when it's unplugged, but I know it hadn't dimmed or anything. So if you're not near an outlet, you're not gaming (it's honestly a nightmare in competitive games). This has me concerned about the longevity of the computer's battery, because keeping it plugged in can't be good for it.",0
I purchased this chromebook for my homeschool kids. The only thing we dislike about it is we havent been able to figure out how to use it with our wacom drawing tablet.,0
Stylus pen has issues at times an computer has been freezing past day or so,0
I do wish that there was a windows hello enabled camera or a fingerprint reader.,0
"Es muy rápida, y cumple con lo que dice la rese?a... El problema es que salió defectuosa del sonido, hace ruidos muy extra?os de pronto, en distintas situaciones",0
The touchpad and fingerprint reader is very sensitive sometimes it will cause mis-typing,0

"False advertising: The product advertised is not what is sent. There is no backlit keyboard or fingerprint reader, other specs are correct.",0
Love the new button feature of the chrome book.,0
"I like how the QWER keys are highlighted on the ""Hero"" edition unlinke the usual WASD.",0
You get plenty of CPU horsepower and lots of blazing fast storage for a laptop.,0
The laptop display is pretty nice and per key RGB is also a huge visual plus point.,0
"I'm still learning the ins and outs of using a Chromebook, but it was very easy to set up and start using. Using GoogleDocs is limited compared to Word or really any full-up word processor, but I will figure it out soon enough.",0
Nice sound quality when playing skyrim se with 100s of mods.,0
"I received the laptop in perfect condition. So far I've had no issues with performance, and reliability. It's really a nice bang for the buck gaming laptop. Just watch out for potential issues with the screen's bezel/frame adhesive, as I found that in my case, it's not correctly holding the bezel to the screen, creating a noticeable gap that's not present in the rest of the bezel. If I continue to find simple quality issues like this, I'm afraid I won't be buying any more Lenovo products in the future.",0
"I like this laptop, it is fast, beautiful, well built, it looks robust, the battery has a good capacity. But it has just 32 Gb emmc of internal storage, after all updates you will be left with arround 3 to 5 Gbs of free space. And there is a windows update, I think that it is the update 1803, That cannot be installed If don't manage your storage. The storage is the only negative point of this product, in my opinion the manufacter should at least put 64GBs. If you buy this product you will need some extra space a microsd or a external hard drive, maybe.",0
"The internet speed and ability for the computer to take multiple windows, downloads and gaming at one time and not over heat is my favorite feature",0
"I bought this laptop about a year ago and was excited about the good reputation of ASUS customer service and products. The model itself looks great, however, the display started flashing blue within a week of arrival. Despite four repairs including a complete replacement of the motherboard and display, the screen was still flashing. The ASUS engineer team is also completely incompetent and completed several repairs not even related to my concern. It took over three months of sending the device in for ASUS to grant me a replacement with a REFURBISHED device. Extremely disappointed with this purchase and I will not be buying from ASUS again.",0
Screen has some heavy/light light bleed on the corners.,0
Low capacity graphics card but powerful,0

"Listen up...............ssd's heat up very quick when lots of data is being transferred. windows 10 is constantly trying to upgrade, which means this laptop sounds like a jet ready for take-off. It even tries to upgrade when I've directed the puter to not upgrade during active hours. So, is this about technology........or lenovo trying to generating revenue? The future looks pretty dim. Good luck & take care.",0
GREAT BUY,0
I love this product as well as Amazon's support and assistance to provide me quickly with a replacement since the first unit is received was faulty on Arrival.,0

Bought this laptop 6 month ago. Very happy with it. We use it for business. So far so good!,0
the keyboard is super easy to get used to and works very well!,0
The boy loves it. Great for the money.,0
Everything runs so well and the design is so sleek,0
I don't like the fact it is hard to hook up to my wireless printer. I'm still not hooked up to my printer.,0
"Elegant, sleek design, gorgeous 4K display and it's very powerful for an Ultrabook.",0
Works well under Linux. Only issue noticed is the touchpad doesn't work out of the box. This can be fixed by running the following as root/sudo----cd /sys/class/gpio/echo 386 > exportcd gpio386echo out > direction----I've opted to make this persistent by saving it as a script and running it as a reboot cron job as sudo.,0
Excellent laptop,0
"Estéticamente es muy buena y funciona muy bien para asuntos básicos de Office, sin embargo, se calienta demasiado y la batería a partir del 50% ya no dura mucho. Nada recomendada para juegos.",0
"I haven't been a fan of Dell computers in the past. In my experience they come bloated with extra software that can't be removed and are almost impossible to work on. This is the first one that I have owned in a long time and I was pleasantly surprised. The only bloatware that comes on it is Dells phone app that is a replica of the one built in to the OS and their support app. Both can be removed if you choose. Normally I would do a clean Windows install to get rid of all of the crap but I didn't have to this time.I read a lot of reviews that the touchscreen wasn't responsive but I haven't experienced any problems with it. I think that might have been fixed in a software update. The combination of Intel's 10th gen I-7 processor, 16gb of DD4 ram and M.2 NVME SSD makes this laptop blazing fast. The ram can be upgraded to 32gb and it has two free M.2 slots available. It comes with a 1tb M.2 PCI-E SSD and the other two free slots are easily accessed to be able to add more. Most laptops these days come with integrated graphics cards but this one has a dedicated Nvidia GTX 1650 TI. I'm not a heavy gamer so I'm not sure how it would perform with graphics intensive games but I think would hold its own. I've thrown multitasking with several excel sheets on different monitors and some light gaming on it and haven't had any lag at all.I would rate the battery life as average. Depending on how I use it and the screen brightness I can get about 6-8 hours on a charge. The good thing is that it doesn't take long at all to charge back up. 30 minutes of charging will net you another 3-4 hours.My only gripe about this laptop is the fingerprint sensor. It is built in with the power button and I often have to try multiple times to get it to read or end up putting my pin in. I would have like it better if they would have had a separate for the sensor. With that said though I absolutely love it. It is leaps and bounds above the Gen 2 Surface pro laptop that I was using.",0
"this computer is everything I need for my at home, personal use. Very fast, keyboard is comfortable to use,. This is not the computer you want for gaming or heavy duty business, but for home use (e-mail, reading newspaper, web-surfing, personal banking, and of course playing candy crush) this computer is awesome. I can't speak for the battery life because I basically leave it plugged in at my desk. I would recommend this computer.",0
"UPDATE:This machine stopped powering on for no reason (never moved/never dropped/no water damage) and I had to send back to ASUS. If I thought the overheating issues were a nightmare I had no idea what I was in store for with ASUS customer service.ASUS customer service wants me to pay *more* for the repair than I originally paid for the laptop. For a machine just out of warranty that decided not to power on one day. I escalated all the way to the CEO and head of customer service and they knocked it down to $1100 for a refurbished unit. No reason for the hardware failure was ever given. I said no of course. This situation would be funny if it wasn't so sad. Between the thermal issues these machines are known to have that make them unusable at times and the customer service issues, I can't recommend this company anymore.I should have stuck with Sager/Clevo.This laptop has such bad thermal designs that even with a clean OS install, the latest BIOS and gpu drivers, I still cannot get near 30fps with Fortnite on low settings.I've experimented with GPU and CPU undervolting and every single diagnostic (GPUZ, Intel XTU, MSI Afterburner, ASUS GPU Tweak, ThrottleStop). The best I ever got was 50ish fps for a few mins before thermal throttling kicked back in.To add insult to injury ASUS is starting to shift all their driver download (hotkeys, AURA) to the Microsoft Store. Sigh, this product is awful.My 10 year old Sager plays Fortnite better than this 2 year old ""gaming"" laptop.UNBELIEVABLE!",0
Perfect computer for casual use,0

"It works for what I use it for. I don't use the touch screen for personal reasons, so I can't rank that.",0
Great laptop computer. Fast and has good battery life. It is lightweight and has a good size screen. My only complaint would be the speakers but I’m sure most laptops aren’t that good. I just use a Bluetooth speaker and am happy with that. Acer is a very good brand and I’ve always been happy with their products. The price was amazing also.,0
"Fell in love with the chromebook. Was a little skeptical about the CLOUD thing, but there's no question that it gets online quicker. Operating System being designed around the browser or vice-versa is an excellent idea.",0

I would HIGHLY recommend doing a fresh install of windows when you receive this laptop, instead of going to a bios flash. It has run super smooth ever since. I did buy it for school/work/casual needs. The main games I have played on it are Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege. They ran flawlessly and the framerates were great on ultra settings. It is highly upgradable with an extra m.2 slot and hdd space.Will update months down the road to see what changes may have come up.",0

"I’m writing this a year after buying this laptop. Do not buy it, absolutely horrible quality laptop, I should have expected that though because of the price. Laptop battery rarely lasts more than 2 hours even at the lowest possible settings. CPU temp sits at a nice 94c when idle. And for some reason, the ONE audio port doesn’t work. And my favorite part, the battery is dying, after only a year of using it, I need to buy a new battery for $95",0

"I've used my new laptop for over 2 months and have had no problems at all. It's fast, light, excellent screen, and even the sound is very good for a laptop.

"This is a great little laptop. I used it primarily for writing and data entry on the bus. It's the perfect size for working on a lapdesk with no elbow room. The battery lasted, the system ran smooth, it was great. The screen does tend to develop a few bright spots.After the pandemic hit and I was no longer on the bus, I gave it to my mom. It's an ideal laptop for less tech-savvy folks that just want to browse the web, comment on political articles, like awkward Facebook photos, or watch Netflix in bed even though they couldn't get the remote to work.",0

"Excelente, no duden ni un solo segundo en comprarla, es lo mejor en relación calidad precio.",0
"This computer works with everything I throw at it gaming-wise. My only real issues with it are the battery life and how it acts on the battery. Games sputter when on the battery, even games that don't need much resources like Rogue Legacy. I also added an extra 1tb m.2 drive and another 8gb of RAM",0
"Bought this in April 2020. Can't play with it until it gets repaired because the ""s"" key came off. Contacted insurance to send it to see if it can be repaired. The manufacturer said they don't cover physical damage.",0
Ive had it for about a month. I was tryibg to find a decent laptop for around 400$ that i would be able to work off and stay mobile with. It does everything I need to run my buisness and has pretty good battary life. One thing I really like is how fast it boots up it comes on in seconds and loads programs fast. Browsing speed is really good too and im able to multitask without slowdowns. The screen is good but is subject to glare pretty easily at times. Touchpad is solid as well as the keyboard. Its not incredible in any department but if youre looking for something that can keep up with a fast paced lifestyle it works great. A solid laptop at a great price point. 7/10 in my book.,0
Great thin design will swivel door USB-A allows an ultra-thin profile but still has 2 USB-A ports.,0
"The laptop only lasted a day. It started displaying vertical red stripes (I guess it is either the graphics card or the screen). Another issue that the warranty activation date with Lenovo was giving me 10 month only , not a year which is strange on the new machine. Would not risk buying it again. I am waiting on the return to get processed , will update the review for the return process / refund.",0
"MSI GL65 Leopard$3000 worth of gaming labtop for $1300.My I.T. Boss price quoted it at $2200 through his connection. So this is a great deal!This is A+ grade for that price.Heres a top tier gaming computer for a budget price. I actually bought 2 of them both with the 4 year insurance each.If I want to i can later add a 2 tb 2.5 hdd or ssd and 2x32gb Ram cards these babys will be golden computers for at least 5 years and i can have them to use now when i need them most.Ps. I ended ip putting 1tb ssd in them. That was all i needed. Way more power than expected!You wont find a better deal. I havent for over a year.This things an A+ grade MONSTER for $1300My bosses quote on the same specs as this deal was 1800 min.Ive been waiting on it and its the right parts for the right price.The graphics card alone is $1000 Plus the special parts on these particular labtops is well worth it. The hd lossless sound is amazing, 144hz screen is fast amd responsive, aliminum lid is a nice touch, the per key programable rgb keyboard lighting and effects are rediculously cool and this super specially desighned and patented heat pipe system is the thing i love the most on this rig!The push keys near the power key to vent heat and turn both fans to full and another to switch between rgb key profiles on the built in steel key series is golden level luxury on a gaming laptop! I love it all!So much that i bought 2",0
"This is my 2nd Acer product and I've never been more happy. The speeds are amazing, quality is top notch. The laptop can get hot if you don't have proper venting but even with higher temps I've never had issues. Solid laptop, plays any game or program I throw at it.",0
"I bought this computer at Best Buy. I loved it!.. at first. It was great for editing my photos and the color was very accurate which I appreciated compared to the cheaper laptop I owned previously. After about 6 months of using it the screen started to flash white. I could still use it but would have to edit between flashes and adjust my screen for it to stop flashing. The flashing became more frequent and I could do less to fix it. I took it in to the geek squad and they fixed it in 4 weeks. It worked for a couple days then the white flashing came back. I would never purchase this laptop again. The concept is nice and it’s a sleek looking laptop, however it is not reliable and really frustrating to use.",0
"This is definitely a gamer's laptop. I was able to play my Xbox Anywhere games without any problem. I didn't notice any lag. It felt like I was playing the game on my Xbox One.The only thing that's awkward for me is the touchpad. I prefer the touchpad in the center. However this laptop has it placed toward the left side. If I was left handed it would be great, but I'm not. However, I am adjusting.With that said, I still give it 5 stars because the processing power and the amount of hard drive storage is so great.",0
"Even at high volume, I can still barely hear media playing. It’s not my settings, and it’s not my ears lol, just can’t hear a thing. I have to turn my subtitles on.",0
"This is an all plastic, budget gaming laptop from Lenovo.The keyboard keys seem smaller than normal. Typing is very quiet and not mechanical. It has a number pad. I don't think gaming laptops should have number pads. As a result of having one, the trackpad is not centered.The trackpad has a spot in the middle where it doesn't left click. I don't think its a defect, but just an artifact of the trackpad being shifted to the left and my fingers are trying to click the in the spot where right and left are separated.It has a 5800H Zen 3 cpu from AMD.You can change the keyboard rgb with fn + spacebar.I like that the large power brick is shaped to wrap the cord around it. This is a nice touch and shows some thought.It also shows some thought that the ports have icons you can see from above, especially since a lot of the ports are on the back. I can simply lower my screen to see what is plugged in without moving the laptop.The bezels are small on the top and sides. The top bezel has a webcam and a slider on the side of the laptop to disable it.This laptop has three Lenovo performance modes: quiet, auto, and performance.The Geekbench CPU score are as follows:On Geekbench this laptop scored the following out of the box, on Lenovo's auto mode, in Windows Better Performance Mode:Single Core: 1466Multi Core: 7380On Geekbench this laptop scored the following out of the box, on Lenovo's auto mode, in Windows Best Performance Plugged-in Mode:Single Core: 1460Multi Core: 7368Levovo's high performance mode made no difference, scoring:Single Core: 1459Multi Core: 7442All of these scores are within Geekbench's normal variations wen you run multiple tests.I plan to upgrade to 1RX8 ram instead of what is presumably 1Rx16 (this is the big ram controversy of 2021) and retest. I have not opened the laptop yet to verify what rank the ram is, or if it is even labeled.There are two video cards in this laptop - AMD's APU Radeon video card and Nvidia's 3050 TI Laptop version.You can run this laptop in hybrid mode, where it only uses the Nvidia card when it needs it, such as games.The Geekbench Compute score are as follows:Radeon:Vulkan - 18566OpenCL - 16883Nvidia:Vulkan - 55043OpenCL - 69700CUDA - 71719I ran the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark, on the default settings: 1920x1080, DLSS off, Fullscreen on, VSYNC off, and Fidelity FX off. The result was an average FPS of 77.If you plan to use this laptop to play new games on high or highest settings, look elsewhere because the 4 GB ram in the 3050TI holds it back. You'll have to play demanding games on Medium. Older, less demanding games are fine though. The 3050TI also has lower technical specs across the board when compared to the 3060.So far, I think this is a well built (although plastic), powerful laptop for the money. Overall, I am very happy with it, but I am not a heavy gamer.Update: After updating to 1Rx8 Ram, the benchmark in Shadow of the Tomb Raider produced 79 FPS (as opposed to 77 FPS with the 1Rx16 RAM).Geekbench CPU tests reported 1455 on the single core score and 8065 on the multi-core score. It seems the multicore score benefits more than single core, so multi-threaded apps would see a benefit by upgrading the RAM.These updated tests were with the laptop in Lenovo's auto mode and Windows Best Performance Plugged-In mode.",0
"For basic browsing or academic work, this is the perfect laptop. It has a great startup time, big keys, and a nice thin look so it's easy to carry.",0
Clean installation with a new m.2 SSD (512GB) was pretty fast,0
"I got this laptop to replace my squeaky HP which became noisy within a relatively short time after I bought it.This laptop is very light and very powerful, just as advertised.It does not have touchscreen capabilities; I guess that would have made it heavier?In any case, I really like the laptop and highly recommend it.",0
We love it,0
First of all.. i am happy with fast delivery.. i choose 5-8 buissnes days for free shiping and it arive in 4 days...second .. this laptop is great product.. extrimly happy with screen quality and it preformance.. runing my favorite games on ultra.. exelente durability and battery life.. simply great,0
El equipo en general es bueno el cpu y la gpu cumplen con lo establecido en las specs el problema es que la pantalla no es de la mejor calidad tiene mucho light bleeding,0
I really enjoy this laptop,0
The laptop looks great and thin just like I wanted.,0
"I really liked this computer, until it stopped working. I've owned it for 15 months now and I thought I'd leave a review. The performance is solid. I installed Windows 11 with no issues. However, after a while, I noticed some performance issues that affected the whole computer, as well as poor sound quality. I thought it was Windows 11, so I installed Ubuntu. The problems still persists on Ubuntu. I believe that I have a hardware problem. Right after the warranty expired. How nice. I didn't like the screen quality on this computer, but it's better than my previous laptop, so it may just be the state-of-the-art and I'm just unfamiliar with laptop displays. I never had memory or performance issues (other than the freezing described above) with it, though. It's also very fast.",0
"I have owned this 6th gen x1 carbon for little over a year. I had some random times when the area to the top left of the machine was very hot, abnormally so. I got a stop code error a month ago, and a few hours before that the laptop started to overheat a bunch and run very quickly out of battery. I turned it off and on again and it fixed itself. Flash forward a month, it does it all day long agian but this time it runs itself into auto kill mode. I power cycle'd 5 more times before I resolved the issue, and this time i watched ""speedfan"" and noticed the cores were just fine in temp, it was my HD that was HOT. After the fact, my HDMI nor two type C ports work for connecting to displays, although the power cord still charges the laptop. I think i'm FUBAR, but as of this moment i bought a wireless adapter to try and creating a work around. that is until the next overheat session happens and this time my entire graphics card blows up! haha just kidding, but serioulsy lenovo plz send me a new laptop at this point. I had the screen replaced in December 2018 and now this?",0
"I haven’t bought a laptop computer since 2012, my purchase was a retina MacBook Pro. 2020, I purchased this and it felt like Christmas! My favorite thing about the laptop is the light up keyboard. There are many apps for it. It is a plastic case, feels flimsy but for what you get inside it is a great deal. The 144hx is noticeable, FPS is great on games. I am using this for unreal 4 and editing. 5/5",0
"I have own a apple iPad and now this ,it is everything I could ask for in a laptop.I have own several other laptops made by different manufacturers and everyone failed me! this is far better and very easy to setup I had no problems setting it up at all! very pleased and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast and powerful laptop!",0
Good for games,0
The power cord plugs in the laptop behind the monitor so you cannot put it against a wall or on a shelf stand.,0
"This comes with a very nice 512 GB SSD, and it's an M.2 drive which means it's crazy fast.",0
"Buena opcion en calidad-precio, la pantalla no es tactil pero tiene buena visualizacion y es una computadora bien equipada",0
Not what I expected.,0
"This is a 5 star product given what it is for the price point. So why only 1 star? I will remove this review if all works out with returning and/or repairing. However, for now I can only give 1 star because it radomly crashes on me! And you have to hold the power key for 20+ seconds to restart and then redo whatever you were working on. Only happens a few times a week and it may be due to needing updates for some of the software...so stay tuned. I saw someone else with the same problem. Not sure if this is an exception or a trend. Like I said, will bump to 5 stars if I decide to return and that goes smoothly or it magically stops crashing on me...Bigger picture. This is exactly what they say it is for an amzing price. If you are in the mood for a cheap and super lightweight and portable chromebook with excellent battery life and super fast internet connection then this is a good buy, just as long as they software issues do not continue!",0
I seem to get about 2 hours' worth of use doing really basic lightweight work with the battery saver on.,0
"I ordered the 2017 Samsung laptop model but they shipped the newer 2018 model. I wanted the 2017 because I had already read the newer one''s screen wasn't as bright and had tried out a 2017 at a BxxxBxx store a couple months earlier, and YUP, it is true. In the course of dealing w/ Amazon to ""exchange"" the 2018 model for the one I actually ordered, the price went up considerably on the older (and better reviewed) model, so I kept the 2018. It's ""okay"" for what I need, but not nearly as good as my old Samsung 2nd generation, which I still use but now has to be tethered full-time to the cord--so not too portable anymore...",0
I have had other chrome books and this one is the boss. No more breaking up of audio while multi-taking. The screen is beautiful. Great screen size. Speakers are good. Very powerful computing power. Blue tooth works flawlessly. Key board excellent. So pleased!!,0
"I read some sterling reviews of people wondering why anybody would not like this computer. I'll tell you why. I've owned Acer and Asis and both cases have failed. Look it up. The hinges on the top fail - one at a time - until soon you're propping the screen against whatever and can't take it anywhere. The case is simply not built to last. It' OK for most projects, but it will fail. Go on Google and see for yourself. There's plenty of advice on how to fix it and none of them work. I had some some success early on taping it all together with electrical tape but that failed too. Now it's propped up against my printer and I can't close the top. At all. Also, be prepared to buy a power cord once a month.",0
This was a good value. It arrived in very clean condition.,0
"So far I like it and would buy it again, though I'm not much of a power user. Mostly for word processing and inter net and reading",0
"This laptop is unbelievably slow. The screen was not as advertised and my Dell from YEARS and YEARS ago that was cheap when I bought it has a better screen. I only kept it because they gave me what I thought was a really good deal, but honestly Im just going to give this away. This isnt even good enough to surf the web and watch Youtube on. Battery life is great though, atleast.",0
Battery died after 10 months. I sent an email to the supplier but didn’t get any reply.,0
It is fast.,0
Great litte laptop so far,0
"the mousepad frequently stops responding/working, which is super annoying.",0
Battery Life is a joke. I'm about to return this and go with a different brand,0
Quick in every task I throw at it,0
Good basic laptop for my middle school aged daughter. Everything works and she is happy with it.,0
"I bought this Lenovo for my Sister for Christmas and she was delighted, as this is Her first computer ( etc.) of any type. I inspected it before I gave it to Her, and I found out it was much more than I expected. For a new Chrome it was a very low price to pay for such a nice machine! Another Great find on Amazon! I am Sincerely grateful to God for all the Love and Kindness He has shown me all these years. His Love, Faithfulness and Kindness Endures Forever! Amen. I want to Thank All at Amazon too. God Bless, Always.",0
it is lightweight and versatile.,0
"The screen is amazing, the keyboard comfortable",0
"the keyboard layout is a bit weird, especially the arrow keys",0
"it came with a user and a password and when i connected it to wifi it was locked by the user. After some struggle now the laptop is usable, support from amazon was great compared to hp where there was no support.",0
"Not really what I was hoping for. Laptop is pretty slow for supposedly being the flagship model of HP, should have just spent the additional money for a gaming laptop simply for the speed.",0
My daughter loves her new laptop!,0
"I do not recommend a 15"" monitor. If you are in the market for a gaming laptop, 17"" matters. I didn't think it would, but I was wrong.Also, the price of the computer is just too much. Even getting it a little cheaper during Prime Day, it was still too much. There are other reputable brands out there that charge a lot less. Don't pay more money for a name if you can get similar quality and possibly better features with a cheaper brand. The lap top even looks boring to me.",0
Love my new Mac!!’,0
"Thin, good battery life, games well and looks stunning",0
"there are plenty of faster and fancier chromebooks, but this has proved to be a solid buy ; indeed, for the price, I believe it's hard to beat.",0
"pretty good for what your paying for and how much external GPU's are going for now days i should have bought 2. people complain about the low power exert that performance is diminished but if you keep it plugged in then theres no problem im getting 70-144 fps on AAA games like destiny, Eldin Ring, medium settings . I paid double this price tag to build a desktop PC that performs only moderately better than this laptop.",0
You pay less and you get more... great buy...,0
Straight steal,0
"This computer is super fast and works great. Nice battery life, and way better value than those overpriced MacBooks.",0
"Just purchased this item and right out of the gate I'm satisfied. The description is spot on and for users who know what to expect in a Chromebook, this is one of the best. Once I use the computer for a month I will put another more relevant review for the performance.",0
"So i bought this item in October of 2018 for my 13 year old daughter who""s birthday is on the 25th December ... she was excited and enjoying the use of this product. Then exactly 3months later it stop working , it is not powering up and i'm so upset wondering if i spent my monies in vein....any way i ordered a new charger for it and i'm awaiting its delivery to see if the problem is the charger why it wont power up.",0
So far it's been doing great. I like the thin style and it looks like MacBook but with a cheaper price.,0
"It's very convenient if you are not doing heavy duty things such as gaming. It's super light, sound quality is great and max volume it's pretty loud. Overall I love it.Doesn't have touch screen. Doesn't have fan control.",0
Personal use.,0
"Great product, awesome price, very good condition, definately recommend",0
"Screen has a lot of bleed at the corners. After about 6 months many of my games began to over heat the cpu after an hour and a hslf of play. I cannot even play Alpha Protocol on high game setting. GPU seems cool and the air coming out is cool, but whete vpu is at there is no air flow. Otherwise its an alright computer..",0
Perfect perfect perfect. Nothing damaged and I got it for a good price! 100 dollars off at the time. Thank you ??????,0
There are more powerful ultrabooks out there but not for this price. Really can't find a complaint about this. This is our 4th swift book purchased for my family over the last 5 years. They hold up well and the fit and finish on the latest model is an improvement.,0
"Improved sound over last chromebook purchased Bought two as gifts, works as expected",0
I've run some simpler programs that were met with loud-ish cooling efforts,0
"Like many of the reviews said, the volume is not very loud, but sound is not something I use my computer for a lot. I have a bluetooth speaker that can give me all the volume I want when I do want it. I think the screen is nicer than what some had described, especially at the price point this computer came in at. Also like many reviews said, the keyboard is not backlit as it is described, unless I'm missing something to turn it on. This was not really a big deal to me, but wish it wouldn't be in the description if it don't have it. Otherwise, I've had it for a few days and am enjoying it very much. For what I paid it seems very fast for my use and a great value.",0
Under 30 days of having it won’t turn on,0
"this item was not as described before shopping, I was not satisfied, so I returned it. was scratch and the power button not appropriately placed",0
"Its total functionally and like new, a good prices and excellent product",0
"I got this computer during the big holiday sales season, and have used it quite a bit since then. Overall, I'd say it meets just about all my needs: fast, sufficient memory and storage, and being thin and light is very nice. It has two USB ports, which is adequate.The two quibbles are, first, that the screen resolution could be (a lot) better; not great for videos, but okay for office work. The second consideration is that, while the battery charges quickly, it only lasts about three hours on battery charge...so I carry around an extension cord for when I'm in meetings and such. Overall, I'd recommend it for people wanting a primarily business laptop, not one for gaming or movie watching.",0
"Great laptop but had it for less than a year and all my speaker besides one still works. They all just randomly stop working one day. Read that these models are known for the speakers to go out. Now I know. This much money, you would think they would be a better quality. Another thing I notice is that when you close the laptop an open jt again, it can take a few press of the power button for the screen to turn on.",0
The speaker has already stopped working on this device. It's only a year old.,0
Rapidez y calidad,0

"If you have plans getting this device to install Linux on bare metal for a lightweight, open source and powerful virtualization capable machine this laptop is not the one. After a fresh Linux install, problems encountered out the box include:? No Bluetooth support? No WIFI support? Brightness control buttons do not workMany laptop manufactures don't spend the time to ensure that their devices work correctly with Linux and this leads to a bad experience. I thought that Lenovo had embraced Linux after hearing some devices would be preinstalled with Fedora however they still have some ways to go. It will take some time before the Linux work flawlessly on this device but until then, you will have to be ready to get your hands dirty compiling and installing the necessary wifi card and graphics card drivers. Otherwise get another laptop.",0
"I have never in my life had so many issues with a brand-new computer. Sending this piece of garbage back to Amazon. You can guess which country makes it. It literally takes force rebooting this thing about 15 - 20 times, every single morning, to get it to stay on. It shuts itself down constantly.",0
"Absolutely loved the product for the month it worked... After that it would not show any signs of life, whenever I tried to start the device it would not turn on or even show charge. I would charge it for a few hours and the led would display charge but the laptop refused to start and once disconnected from the outlet would once again display zero signs of life.I have sent multiple messages to the seller through Amazon with zero response. Do not buy this product and if you do go directly so if it buggers up you can get a replacement!",0
Speakers arent amazing but its a fast computer,0
"I'm a casual home user. This unit is awful. I don't know the verbiage, but I've had nothing but problems since my purchase 2+ months ago. I still have my old HP PC which still works, it's at least 10 yrs old. I'm done w HP.",0
Good laptop for 6gigs works well not a touch screen light up keyboards,0
"This is a nice laptop. I like the 10-key and the ""TUF"" part of it. It does seem slightly more rugged than other laptops but also does not seem like it is much heavier. At first, I did not pay attention to that but now that we got it and are using it, I realize the rugged military spec is my favorite part. It is the very lowest of the military specs so it's not super strong like our Toughbooks at work but at least it is there.The battery life also seems good. It was used for an outing already and it went from 80% to 65% (something like that) in about 2 hours - no gaming though. It also has a feature that will only charge it to 80% to help the battery last longer...we enabled that.",0
"I tried to like it, I only need it to type on Word and browse online but it is too basic even for that. If you intend to do a lot of typing on this don't buy it. It looks and feels great, but that's it. I recommend this for kids in school maybe.",0
The fans will get quite loud during gaming,0
how light it is,0
The hinges don't leave me confident in the durability either.,0
I play counter-strike: global offensive and having a laptop with a high refresh rate screen was very important for me.,0
"The option for a foldable, flexible, or even expandable screen would be a significant upgrade. This feature would allow users to enjoy the benefits of a large screen without the burden of extra weight.",1
This beats the heck out of my old laptop that I have for 6 years however the screen is a bit smaller but I will use my hdmi cord to hook it up to my 4k tv so I am all good now,0
"This product was advertised as new. When I opened it, there were two user profiles already set up (see photo) and the language was set for a non-English language. When I called Amazon, they sent me to Dell. When I called Dell, they said the computer (which I purchased on 9/21/19) was originally purchased/set up in June.I am returning this. I bought it for my kid. Kids can be rough on equipment, so I want to give him the benefit of starting with new equipment. Also, who knows what the prior owner did with it.",0
"After going thru entire setup, determined there was nothing behind the so called key to turn on the backlight. Tried everything short of getting the big hammer out so I’ve returned it. However I did like what I had seen so far and for the price, thought I’d give them other chance before hitting a big box store. Fingers crossed my next one arrives in 4 days.EDIT: This seller apparently doesn’t know how to send you the correct laptop. Twice now I have received a laptop that does not have a backlit keyboard. Reducing to one star.To anyone who isn’t sure, if your F7 key does not have the little symbol of a keyboard on it, you have been given the wrong laptop, as there is not backlighting on your keyboard. Seller: Please check your merchandise and your orders carefully. I don’t see why it should be so difficult to send your customers the product you are explicitly advertising.",0
"I use daily for routine computer use. I rarely use my desk top computer anymore. The only problem is I can't figure out how to set it up to use printer. If I could, my desk computer would be a thing of the past.",0
stop working before three months.Black screen.It wont start.Not satisfied.,0
The display is truly beautiful.,0
"Everything was fine at the beginning but after a few days the touchpad started acting up, it'd sort of lag every couple minutes but all i had to do to fix it is press a button on my keyboard. Fair enough, it couldn't get any worse right? Wrong. About a week later my screen just starts flashing every few seconds... Idk why but this thing is just falling apart way too fast, which is too bad because I was really looking forward to using it. So long story short, if you order this there's probably a chance you'll have to replace it/return it shortly after.",0
"It’s a good laptop but it only comes with a trial of Microsoft Office that will expire and then will ask you to buy a subscription. This was not clear to me in the description, so keep this in mind if you decide to get it.",0
"Battery ? 10/10 especially for a gaming laptop. Avg 10-11hrs light-medium use.Performance? 10/10 Among the best for laptops, CPU & GPU.Cooling? 10/10 on manual mode 100% fans. Not as loud as you think. 100% use on CPU and GPU results in temps of around 70 degrees for both. Really good for a laptop. Gaming on turbo is quieter and results in good temps of 75 GPU and 80 CPU as well.Value? 9/10 these new laptops are fairly expensive but the performance is there.Pros: Mechanical keyboard is actually pretty nice IMO, it makes a decent amount of noise not recommended to use in a quiet room if others are bothered by noise but it feels really good and it's very nice to type on. Performance is out of this world, remember to buy a second SSD (if needed) and 16GB of ram as adding another stick of ram will enable Dual Channel memory thereby enhancing performance overall. Backlighting and LED control are good. Screen sharpness for a 15"" is more than adequate. Very impressed.Cons: The look of the smokey see-through keyboard and the mechanical keyboard itself isn't for everyone. The keystone is a super useless gimmick but I do like the spirit behind it. Somewhat redundant FN keys for fans etc. The palm rests/plastic parts are a huge smudge-fest. If you hands are clean and dry it isn't that bad but it could be better for sure. The 300hz is a little overkill as most people will never need/see frames that high.",0
"Realmente es un modelo que vale la pena en funcion del precio, mas que completo, aporta mas que una laptop basica.",0

"Has very good specs for the price. Very few if any name brand laptops with a full rtx 2070 and a 10th gen i7 for this price. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. Very crisp and clear, 144hz so very smooth. The fans can get pretty loud but wow they are strong, which is good for gaming. Speakers are pretty weak, they sound like the audio is playing through a tin can, and doesnt get very loud. Battery life is horrible. gets about an hour, give or take, on a full charge. Not super easy to take apart, i opened it up to put a 2.5"" SSD in and it didnt quite snap back together very well. Overall id recommend this laptop.",0
"I really wanted to like this computer. And I did, except that the battery didn't work. It's fast and has a nice keyboard and display. It's very light weight and attractive. Mine apparently had a defective battery that wouldn't charge, and the OS reported 'No battery installed.' I returned it. Amazon was very good about the return.",0
"This laptop definitely has its pros and cons but for the price range that is to be expected. Many other reviews complain of sound which is very quiet but the laptop has bluetooth so I was able to just Bluetooth a speaker to it to solve that issue. I have no issue with the screen like many others have so either I’m not picky or I got lucky to get a good screen. This laptop does come with a 1 year manufacturer warranty. Which I am currently in the process of using to have a faulty hinge replaced. 8gb of ram is more than enough for my online college classes but there is also space to expand this if you need to. I’m also able to run sims 4, wizard 101, and other more minor games with no issue. It can run games like fortnite but it only runs on the lowest graphics setting and gets hot fast so if you are looking to do more online popular games I would suggest a different laptop with better specs all around. I did only get the 128gb of space but to fix this I bought an external SSD with a 500gb capacity. They have different sizes which is something you should look into before buying so you know what to expect for more space. All in all it’s a perfect laptop for me. The battery life is fine for most of my school work I can normally run it from full for 1-2 hours depending on if I’m doing work or gaming. I would recommend this laptop for anyone who just needs a basic laptop for everyday use that isn’t gaming. Unfortunately if you want a laptop for a more intense gaming experience you’ll need to be looking at laptops much higher than the price of this one.",0
I really enjoy using my chromebook. It is reliable and extremely easy to use.,0
Very happy with this computer. Have not had an issue with any games so far.Runs smooth. Works great. Sound output seems a little low to me at max volume.,0
"Good computer for the price, rally nice look and shape, little bit heavy weight. But happy with this",0
"No issues so far whatsoever. Boots up very quickly from off. I have 0 complaints, great price for a nice laptop",0
"My previous laptop just up and died with the blue screen of death. I had purchased the same brand - ASUS - for my father back at Xmas and he loves his. Super fast, great screen resolution, plays movies and music with great picture and sound, different model, his is a 15"".So I got myself one.This is fantastic! I might eventually add more memory, but what's on here is more than I need. It did come with the 'linkage' you need internally to add more memory.I don't game, so can't answer that question for anyone, and mine is NOT a touch screen (thank god!).Picture is super clear, good crisp colors. If you do graphic design and such, can't speak to that.Sounds are great, no echo or tiny qualities.Screen goes all the way to the edge!!!I don't have a problem with the keyboard color, yes it is just a few shades darker than the keys themselves, but it is back lit which helps. I type for a living so if you hunt and peck to type - this is not going to be for you.The power button over on the top right of the 10-key pad is a nice placement.The way the lid slides under the base gives it just that perfect ergonomic lift that really helps with typing.Plenty of ports for things, power plug is very low profile and unobtrusive (and long!).I surf the net, watch movies and youtube, work in a chat feature (like Teams). Pretty boring. But this suits all of my needs and then some.Setting up the internet was super easy.The only minor minor minor draw back is a lack of CD/DVD component, BUT - you can get an external CD/DVD drive for next to nothing and plug it in with a USB.If you just need a good basic work horse laptop and some extra oomph - this is a sure ticket to get.Would I recommend it for children, college students? Absolutely.Add more memory or an external drive if your college student is working in astrophysics, computer coding or a medical program and you're set!Will absolutely buy this brand again.",0
"The sound, with the Bang & Olufsen speakers, is excellent for a laptop",0
I used this Chromebook to replace an old one It works great as advertised,0
So fast!,0
Nice item...,0
Heat becomes a problem very quickly when running a demanding game.,0
the backlighting switched from my preset to just plain white background,0
It was price a little bit on the expensive side,0
It has so much screenbleeed and it sometimes doesn’t charge,0
"Looks really impressive, and very good value for money at this price point.",0
This is the perfect computer for me for the cost. Great features.,0
matte black with copper accents is simple and professional,0
"Barely used it so far. It could handle the CAD programs I bought it for. So far really fast. No HDMI port made it hard to plug into my 2nd monitor, but i found an adaptor/cord to use with it instead.",0
"I just use my home computer for entertainment purposes only. Internet, mostly and storing Albums. If that's all you need just get this one and save $$.",0
"It worked out good for my daughter. She’s happy with it, so there you have it.",0
"I bought this saying it’s good for school being that I am a teacher can make my lessons plan and use PowerPoint to create lessons. So far so good the soft ware was blocked I YouTubed and unlocked it out of Smode so for me it’s fine and got the job done!I recently started noticing that my laptop overheats for no reason. As once I turn it on and I put it down for 15 -20 mins. The entire laptop overheats. And once that happens that’s it for some time I have to wait until it catches itself and then proceed with whatever I was doing before.I mean I expect something to go wrong but I have had it since July 2021 and it’s March 2022 and from January I noticed the overheating. And trust me I don’t charge it too often.All in all, I am preparing my mind to know I have to start looking for a new laptop soon. Because this one is definitely going to give up on me by July 2022.I like the laptop tough wish I had gotten a better one.",0
"Estoy satisfecho con la compra, tardó 1 semana en llegar a Costa Rica, menos del tiempo estimado muy rápido! Es una muy buena opción tomando en cuenta el precio por el tipo de máquina que es, le daré uso para la universidad y algunos juegos casuales. La pantalla es excelente y si bien, en algunos comentarios indican lo contrario debido a los ángulos de visión, la verdad no es un factor que me afecte ya que la utilizo en un escritorio, es cuestión de gustos.Con respecto al sonido, siempre se ha sabido que las portátiles tienen un sonido estándar, para mejor audio, compras unos parlantes y listo! Si quieres una laptop algo exigente, hay otras opciones a mayor precio. De momento 0 quejas con la máquina es una excelente opción, la recomiendo para aquellas personas que no deseen gastar mucho y busquen algo decente para estudio y algunos juegos casuales.",0
"Excelente producto, mju buena calidad",0
"Purchased April 2021, Laptop ran ok for a few months and now is incredibly slow and useless. No returns either.",0
"very nice, my first chromebook always had a laptop pc,but this works for me just great,price is good as well",0
"I bought this product because I saw that it had 1TB of storage memory. But, when I received it and logged on to it, I discovered it only had 128GB.",0
"I've had and used iPhones from the beginning and had iPads since the iPad 2 but this is my very first Mac and I thought it might be a lot to learn this OS but things were familiar cuz I've used and owned iPads and iPhones. I'm still having to learn a few things and had to Google questions on how to do somethings but it's been a good experience. I really didn't expect that. I love the OS BIG SUR and now can't wait to the next OS. I only got 256gb cuz I didn't know if I would like this plus I knew i had to learn the OS. Now, I'm waiting for the M2 Mac Book Pro, i plan to invest a lot more money into that one now I know that I like the Apple OS. Looking at getting 2tb 32gigs of ram! I like that it runs the apps from iOS or iPadOS! I wish the screen was better though. I'm talking at least mini-led but would prefer OLED for what I use it for. Battery life is amazing! Camera quality sucks. Come on Apple, give us the 2021 M1 iPad Pro camera and stop being so cheap!I'm happy with my purchase. I will probably give this to my mom when the M2 MacBook Pro comes out!",0
Keyboard feels nice and solid,0
El producto es tal como lo específica el vendedor,0
I received numerous discolored vertical lines in a two inch slice of the screen,0
"I bought this to replace a 2015 MacBook Pro, and it’s worked out great. Better screen and better battery life. Much faster processor. Also much thinner and lighter yet I can use my existing laptop sleeve. Happy with this.",0
This laptop is LIGHT,0
The speakers are noticeably louder and has good quality than typical laptops.,0
Was really nervous purchasing a laptop through Amazon that I had never seen before but it was in perfect condition and I have no complaints,0
Perfect for my 10yr old niece. It's small and only intended for web browsing.,0
"Like other chromebooks, this one holds a charge, browses the internet, contains all of the letter keys, and allows the screen to be darker or brighter. Unlike other computers, it costs only one hundred and eighty-two dollars, and when my child spills juice on it I will only be out about half the price of most other chromebooks. Going strong after a year of daily use. Lightweight. Probably not good for people with large hands or who want to use this as a primary viewing device for television (quality is fine but screen is not as big as big chromebooks). Once I sat on it and it was fine.",0
"Very fast!The laptop works great, and everything loads super fast. 10/10 would recommend",0
The light up keyboard has gotten dozens of compliments after only having the machine for about 2 weeks.,0
its okay just want more access to apps in the app store,0
"I just bought this to replace my current laptop. I use it primarily for art and writing. Unfortunately, the security feature, S Mode, prevents me from doing that. Also Microsoft is messed up on it so I pretty much can't do anything on it. Nor as of currently can I get it fixed. So as of right now, I just wasted a lot of money on a laptop I cannot use.Wouldn't recommend to anyoneEdited here: after reading the reviews here I found someone had factory reset their laptop and it worked. I did the same and just like that it fixed the issue! Now it works perfectly and I've been drawing since. Leaving it as a four star because this security feature shouldn't even exist on these laptops.",0
The 3Stars because it was delivery to the wrong hous for a a day an its only been an hour for me to check it out,0
Purchased the laptop for a wonderful young lady and she’s enjoying it immensely,0
"I wanted a decent-sized laptop to use for traveling mainly for emails & some general Internet browsing as well. I went thru the variety of Windows 10 laptops & suddenly realized that Chromebook is a laptop as well, but more limited on what it can do compared to a Windows or Apple laptop. So I got this Acer Chromebook CB3-532 as my first Chromebook. Very nice looking laptop with a 15.6 inch screen, fairly easy to set up with a fairly good picture quality. It has a built-in webcam with mic, SD card reader, 1 USB 3.0 port & 1 USB 2.0 port plus HDMI port. It has 2 gigabytes of memory, 16 drive & headphone/speaker jack. It does not however have a CD/DVD player/burner. I attached an external mouse to use on this Chromebook....it works just fine. Laptop seems slightly sluggish but not a major issue for me....yet. I have had this Acer Chromebook for a month now & still a learning curve as I have been using Windows laptops for over 12 years now......so indeed a big learning curve for me. It has wifi connectivity & you cannot hard wire into the Internet with this Chromebook, just by wifi....which is fine for me.There are no real icons on the desktop of Chromebook. Whatever I used on my Windows 7 laptop & had desktop icons....I simply will have to funnel it through Chrome browser already on this laptop. Battery life seems good at currently 7 hour life on a full charge and for the most part, this nifty Chromebook should do fine for me . 4 stars I give this interesting Chromebook mostly because it's a new thing for me to learn, but similar to my Android Smartphone....so not too bad, no desktop icons like a Android smartphone however. Needless to say, a learning experience for me with this Chromebook...keyboard a bit lacking features compared to a Windows/Apple keyboard. I may attach an external keyboard to see if the delete key works this way since the built-in keyboard does not have a delete key.",0
"Excellent laptop. It has enough ports and it is very tough. I use for programming, some video editing with after effects and Adobe premiere, and even some light gaming.",0
"We purchased this for my daughter so she could write. It works perfectly fine. However, It does feel like cheap plastic. And the mouse you have to hit hard for it to realize you are trying to double click on it. That being said, you can't beat the price.",0
I purchased this laptop for my wife and she is very happy with it's performance.,0
"It’s very good quality. I recommend it, I used it for zoom chats and Netflix and for about everything you can imagine it’s quick it’s a normal size. It’s a bout a clipboard long. And it’s very light weight. It has a charger and it’s modern.",0
It comes with some annoying bloatware,0
Super dope computer,0
Not good for gaming would not play space engineers stream,0
This computer DOES NOT have a back lit keyboard as advertised. I am not happy about that at all. Otherwise it's ok for communications and business needs.,0
"Good computer perfect for school. The only thing that sucks is it doesn’t run google play store, but the new model does for only $40 more.",0
"This M1 replaces a 2015 MacBook Air. It's actually the second M1 Air in our family (I bought a refurbished one earlier this year to replace a retiring 2012 Air), and at $799 for the 8 GB RAM / 256 GB SSD model is an insanely great value.Some of the other recent reviews mentioned a musty odor and speculated these had been in storage or previously used. There was a slight musty or chemical odor when the box was opened, but upon checking carefully I found the smell originated from the included printed materials, NOT the computer itself or the packaging. There was absolutely no sign of mold, moisture, or dampness in the box, the sealed packaging, or the laptop.Installing and running a utility showed this Air was assembled in August 2022 and had so far logged no battery cycles. It's a new M1 Air, not old stock. (The 2020 date in the description is the year the M1 Air model was introduced, not when this computer was made.)",0
"La laptop tiene muy buen desempe?o, es rápida, el único pero que le pongo es que no trae puerto ethernet y el teclado es gris en condiciones de poca luz se batalla un poco para ver las letras, pero por lo demás esta bien, excelente Laptop.",0
"The laptop works great, feels and looks amazing, for everything from gaming to doing cad or other programs. However the worst part is even with all the battery saving and performance lowered to minimal it never gets more than 2hrs of battery life when being used lightly. This wouldn't be optimal unless you had an outlet within 5ft of you every other hour to charge it back up or just keep it going for longer. Kinda sad for portable uses but then again the power consumption seems to back the parts it packin. Definitely showing that the 12th gen intel and 3070 are power hungry.",0
"I've had this computer for about a week so far (work ordered it) and so far it is a good value. key board is very comfortable, graphics are decent, everything operates smoothly. the only thing making this a good value from a great value is the speakers stink. I cant hear anything...",0
The title says Touchscreen but it is not. I didn't buy it because it said touchscreen I just thought that would be a plus if it did so it is not a deal breaker. It is fast it uses 5g and has a 4k display.,0
I bought this on a Amazon treasure truck ? deal. I read many reviews before the purchase and many complain of issues connecting to wireless. I have had no such issues nor any other issues. Matter of fact this is the best PC I have ever used personally. I find I never have to wait on it to do anything. It boots up faster than any previous PC I've had. Now it only comes with a free trial of anti virus software so I simply use avast one free edition but you also have the option to use windows defender at no charge at it has improved alot over the years not as good as avast but almost. Overall I find the unit to be an excellent value and would recommend it!,0
"This is a great deal, The product came as promised and on time. This laptop is worth getting! i7, 16gig of RAM and SSD makes this laptop super fast to boot and respond.",0
"Great gaming laptop. Only bad thing about this laptop it's his battery, about 4hrs of working time.",0
"This laptop is fantastic, and overall I am very satisfied with this purchase. But let's talk about the elephant in the room that a few reviewers have already pointed out: ""Is this a new product?"". Given the $2000 price tag, it's only natural to be concerned about the integrity of the product you are receiving. I understand that entirely as I was very concerned myself.For me, the laptop itself was inside its original packaging and showed no signs of being opened before. With that said, the box was a little banged up upon arrival. The laptop itself was wrapped around plastic, and everything inside seemed in place.Now, there is a shipping label on the original packaging box from ""Dell Returns"" located in Lebanon, Tennessee. So I did some quick investigating. I read that most returns for Dell products will get shipped to this Return Center in Lebanon, Tennessee. These returns include order cancellations and unopened returns. Dell Outlet, in turn, sells these ""new unused"" products at a cheaper price tag. So yes, I believe this product is ""NEW"", but it is new under the Dell Outlet standards. This is just my assumption but is the most logical reason I can think of.For me, I have no problem receiving a Dell Outlet product, but it should at least be advertised as such on Amazon. Now, considering all of these factors and even if this is a Dell Outlet product, getting a Dell XPS 15 (2020 model) at this price (~$2000) is a STEAL! You are getting Dell's UHD+ touchscreen infinity display, latest i7 CPU, 1 TB of SSD storage, and Windows 10 Pro. If you were buying this same laptop configuration off of Dell's official website, it run you close to ~$2500. On top of the cheaper price tag on Amazon, there is a 10% back for customers who purchase this laptop on a Amazon Prime Visa card (~$200 back).The laptop itself has solid specs and is built very solidly. The aluminum casing and carbon fiber finish gives this laptop a premium feel. The display is gorgeous and crisp. The touchscreen is super responsive. The track pad is honestly the best I have experienced on any Windows laptop. I personally have NOT had the wobbly track pad issue some users were having.Some issues I do have with the laptop is that it does heat up quite a bit, and you can hear the fans spinning pretty hard at times. Dell has a weird adaptive brightness feature, but you can easily turn this off in the settings. Battery life is less than impressive when you are doing more intensive tasks. I hear the pre-installed McAfee software plays a role in draining the battery, so you could disable it and use the built-in Windows Defender. And while I love the carbon fiber finish (because it gives it an even more premium feel), it is definitely a fingerprint magnet lol.All in all, this laptop is absolutely stunning. The amount of features you receive for the price that you buy this laptop at outweighs the minor issues that I have pointed out.",0
"He tenido la desafortunada experiencia, que me llego este producto con un da?o en el puerto de carga, hay que estar sosteniendo el cable de carga, para que el equipo cargue. El equipo funciona bien, pero esta falla se vuelve un problema ya que el equipo lo traje a Latinoamérica, me resulta mas caro hacer la devolución y que me entreguen uno nuevo, que buscar un técnico que lo arregle localmente y perder la garantía.",0
I liked,0
Its a good chromebook but the text is small but you can adjust it in the settings. I know this when I bought it though. I only use it a few time throughout the year. Good for the price.,0
Looks like an old school laptop/ netbook.,0
I don't especially like is the placement of the power button on the keyboard as if it was just another key.,0
"Very good computer for gaming and daily use, I love it, it came on perfect conditions.",0
"There is no touch screen, not sure why I had to rate that. The laptop is good, however the battery life disappeared in months, and it’s only good for about 6 hours, the Bluetooth sucks, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t, and my keyboard buttons don’t work, well some of them anyways, and I’ve had no spillage.",0
"This laptop performs phenomenally! Capable of running Elden Ring at 1440p High settings @60fps! That’s incredible and I love it. Currently using the laptop for on the go gaming and editing whilst also using it on downtime with my 4K 55” and it works perfect! This thing can run a surprising amount of games at 4K and 1440p perfectly fine. The system gives a lot of fan settings to really tune it up to how you want it to play. Extreme mode is the best for absolute gaming but it can get very loud, I recommend default of Quite if you plan to just watch YouTube or something. Build quality is strong and the keyboard is great! Beautiful system all around.",0
I use my computer for game modifications for my Xbox and to edit and share/save my family photos. You can customize a lot on this computer. I still have a couple more things I can customize later but so far I’m very impressed with how custom you can set up your different apps and programs and the vibrance of the screen also everything’s very light touch you don’t have to click very hard.,0
"I bought this laptop for school and casual gaming. Not 30 minutes in it crashes, I updated the drivers which helped but I couldn’t even run Minecraft for more than a minute. Refurbished my ass, had to pay extra to ship to MSI to fix. Would give it one start but I called support and they were very nice and covered the cost to ship it to msi??",0
Great product for the price! Compact and light... just perfect for me needs!,0
Times itself out worst product ever,0
"This model is one of the lower end or entry level Aspire 5, it's decently equipped for the price of $399. Some of the shortcomings have the option to be upgraded after you buy it, thanks to an open RAM slot, easily accessible M.2 drive and a space for a 2.5"" Sata SSD or HDD. Unlike a lot of laptops coming out these days, Acer is not hostile towards repairs or upgrades to the machine. This is awesome and I wish that it was the status quo for laptop manufacturers.This computer is equipped with the newest 11th generation Intel Core i3 processor, it's only a dual core CPU but it's still a fast one. Single core performance is as good as the older Core i7 in my main laptop, Multicore performance is lower considering that it only has 2 cores. It's still plenty capable for most things. It has the newer Xe graphics architecture, but with only 48 Execution Units. This is about half of what you would get with an i7, and I think that's why it is still considered ""Intel UHD"" graphics. Some gaming is possible, performance should be better than the previous generation Ice Lake chips. But I still don't think it will yield enough of an improvement for me to recommend this specifically for gaming. 4GB of ram is about the smallest amount that you can get away with to run Windows 10. I would urge you to spend $30 on a 4GB stick after you buy this, to have a total of 8GB because that will give you a better experience and it's cheaper than buying a more expensive model from Acer. The 128GB SSD is made by Samsung in the model that I received, it was speedy and allows the computer to boot up fast and make Windows updates go a lot quicker. If that is not enough space, you could easily add more after you buy the computer. You will always save money by performing upgrades yourself, compared to buying models with more RAM and storage (which is why many brands don't give you the option to do this).You get an excellent selection of ports on this laptop- 3x USB A ports, 1x USB C port, HDMI, Ethernet, headphone jack. 3 of the USB ports support the 3.2 gen 1 speed of 5 Gigabits for data transfer. Charging is restricted to the proprietary barrel plug that the adapter comes with. So no USB C charging, and no video out over that port, either. This isn't that big of a deal since you do have the HDMI port on board.Moving on to the build quality- this is where the news is not so good. The lid is actually aluminum, but the rest of the laptop is basically all plastic. There is a bit of flex to the keyboard deck and you will have to be more careful with this laptop than you would with an all metal design. It's not like this thing is gonna fall apart on you or anything, but it's my job to point out the product's shortcomings. The screen is another place where I feel like Acer cheaped out, the colors are just faded and washed out looking. It also has bad vertical viewing angles, if you tilt the display too far back or forward, it looks like a fog is forming between you and the screen. It has bad coverage of the sRGB color space (only about 55%). This is part of why the colors don't look vibrant at all.The keyboard is good, it's not great but it should work well enough for most people. It's not backlit, but at least the keys are black with white letters, it should help for seeing them in low light. The trackpad is a little worse, for one thing, it's off center and it messes with your muscle memory if you are used to using centered ones. It's also cheap plastic and you feel the resistance when you are moving your fingers over the surface. I would just end up using a mouse if I was gonna be using this laptop regularly.I think that this is an ok purchase for the money, but I would urge you to be ready to open the bottom panel in order to add more RAM and possibly storage to get the most out of this machine. And keep in mind that the screen is not super nice to look at. Any Windows 10 laptop at this price is gonna have some flaws, this one is one of the better options available, considering it lets you fix some of the problems after you buy it.",0
Enjoying the fingerprint feature of this new MAC air. Loading is quick with the new Apple M1 chip.Wish I could use a mouse instead of touchpad. Did that on prior models over the years.,0
"The keys started to stick. When I push the @ sign, the "" shows up and vice versa.",0
The laptop comes with Windows 10 instead of Windows 11 as advertised. Seller refuses to accept responsibility for false advertising,0
"El envio llego muy rapido, encantada con esta portatil muy rapida, recomendada",0
The 144HZ frame rate is butter smooth and totally worth sacrificing a 4K display for.,0
"Great little Chromebook, never worked with one before. I got the hang of it quickly. A lot of short cut keys built-in the keyboard. It is a little on the small side but I adapted. Works great and is a good value.",0
"the 6th month comes around, the screen just loves to black out frequently.",0
Muy buena maquina. Se escucha muy bajo el alta voz.,0
Speed of operation is great. Have not used any touch or gaming. It's only been two days.,0
I am really happy with my purchase and very impressed. To be fair I cant' rate battery life just yet as I just got it but by every other measure I don't expect to be disappointed. The keyboard feels great. The backlight isn't too obnoxious. The touchpad is appropriately responsive. It has good airflow... which is really important considering most age failures are a result of heat. If I had to say one bad thing it would be the process of registering the product through MSI because their server appears to be down. I'd really like to register this soon.,0
"Buena adquisición llego en perfecta condiciones, una buena inversion.",0
arrived earlier than expected. great product. the advice,0
Has never held a charge or been able to work without being plugged into the outlet. Now the screen just stays black even when plugged in due to not enough power from the battery =( Would not buy refurbished from this site again.,0
"Fantastic laptop, best laptop I’ve ever owned.",0
Really good,0
"Early returns are solid, best price for these specs I could find at OD after searching for a couple weeks post Black Friday. Not the prettiest laptop I’ve ever seen, but not bad and certainly thin/light/fast. No touchscreen was a plus for me",0

"I loved my ASUS laptop for the one year that it lasted before the screen hinges broke apart. I purchased this laptop June 2018 and have used it very lightly in that time. I mostly use it to check work email from home (which thankfully is infrequent). The laptop is lightweight, great screen, and is super quick, however, the build quality is obviously lacking. I opened my laptop up yesterday morning and both hinges suddenly cracked and snapped and separated almost completely from the laptop body. So now basically the laptop is useless as the screen no longer has any support and is just flopped down closed. I've reached out to ASUS customer support but so far have not heard back. There is only a 12 month warranty on the laptop so whatever repair costs associated with this fix will most likely be on my dime. Disappointing considering besides this issue the laptop was great.Update: Spoke with ASUS support, they won't do anything beside the standard repair which incurs a 60$ diagnostic fee and then whatever extra cost for the actual repair. Disappointed as I'm just past the year mark and they still won't do the repair at no charge. I own many ASUS products but this will likely be my last.",0
Product came to me like new. Have been using it since I bought it and it is doing the job I needed it to do. I use it for work and it works well. Literally everything works well. Disregard my blue post it note covering the web cam. No complaints and it’s been a couple weeks now? That I have been using it literally every day for work. I have until December to return it but I don’t think I will be returning it. 🙏🏽🙏🏽Thanks Amazon refurbishing dept for this deal.,0
"I thought it was a good deal for the amount of horse power this computer has, so I bought two of them. within the first few weeks both laptops’ network cards failed, and they're unable to connect to wifi. So we've had to use usb wifi dongles. Would not recommend this product.",0
"Ordered this to replace a 7 yr old Windows 7 laptop that was at it's upgrade limit. The family friend that uses this laptop lives in the country where internet is almost non existent. Needed something that could run for a relatively long time on battery, but was still easy to use. Windows 11 image used allowed setup without a Microsoft account which was helpful for the aforementioned lack of internet. Had to adjust the settings to move the start button to the old location and had to do some training on the differences when coming from Windows 7. Overall a nice laptop with a nice track pad and screen as well as battery life. Was nice enough that I am considering ordering another one for myself.",0

Pros: 1)great price for RTX 30702) GPU performance enough for light gamer3) light weight gaming laptop4) two storage drivesCons: NoneOverall Review: I do recommend this laptop for everyone. It does what it's supposed to do and I have no complaints so far. It is great for light gamer.,0
"Excelente equipo de alto rendimiento, con un arranque del sistema operativo entre12 y15 segundos; cuando en mi otro equipo tardaba hasta 3 minutos solo para el sistema operativo con la misma versión de Windows 10",0
"This was my first gaming laptop and because of this thing I will never buy another one. I used to play on a PC but had to go to college so I needed a laptop and didn't want to bring a bulky tower to my dorm. I thought a gaming laptop was a great solution, a little extra money but I could still game so it would be worth it. This laptop works great as a heater in the winter, as long as you don't put it against your bare skin. This laptop got so hot turned the clear lacquer on a wooden table white. If you are stranded on a desert island and need to light a fire, set this ""gaming laptop"" on top of a pile of sticks and start playing Far Cry 3 on medium graphics. That game is 7 years old and must be played on low graphics at 45 fps to not run at 95 Celsius. A cooling pad is a must have but even then I've never been able to ANY game at anything above Medium-High graphics at 45 fps without being afraid of melting my processor. Don't buy. Also battery life is awful. I lost 30% writing this review. Also maybe something is terribly wrong with my computer and someone has a suggestion on how to fix, anyone? Thanks.",0
Very small.,0
"I just do not understand how a person can keep using this computer. After having multiple chromebooks, i went into this with an expectation, and it fell very low. It's not the worst computer in the world or anything, but it is exceedingly slow, and I can not stand it. I literally counted 10 seconds before it registered that I pressed cut on a highlighted string of text and for a computer I use primarily for google docs, this is unacceptable. Deeply disappointed and I intend to return ASAP.",0
"I love this laptop! I didn’t want to spend too much as I don’t play many games and this was really worth it. The battery life is pretty bad but it’s understandable as it runs quite fast. I play the sims 4 with all packs and tons of extra content and it runs perfectly well, so I wouldn’t worry about that.",0
"I receive the product just in time. The performace is awesome. It is a fairly light laptop. I had a 15.6"" laptop several years ago but my back claimed its weight. When I take the laptop in my hands it is even lighter than another 14"" laptop that I have.I really liked the alexa built in. The laptop is very quiet and perfect for office work. I bought it for my daughter and her college jobs.Recommended 100%",0
got this thing because I needed a windows laptop for some unity development and the macbook pro/imac I have won't cut it.,0
My daughter love this Chromebook,0
Ordered this about 7 weeks ago. It has stopped working several times. Battery area gets incredibly hot. Fan runs on high. Then the computer just crashes.I called tech support. Still having issues.Called again & they said I will have to return it for repairs. No refund allowed.I definitely would not recommend this product.,0
"I have had many computers in my life... custom and store-bought. This one has been pretty good so far. Handles everything I need professionally and everything I want for fun. As a gamer and designer, this gets it done.UPDATE - It was fun while it lasted. Stars have been reduced but only due to some nonsense. I bought this computer on 6/1/2020. Today is 2/28/21 and marks just at 8 months.Yesterday, one of the fans completely failed - with a very noisy and dramatic exit. Shortly after, the PC began to get very hot. I can't use it for work now. I can't (shouldn't) use it at all. It's loud and sounds like it is about to blow up.Reached out to the seller, and the seller recommended that I reach out to Acer - since it is still under factory warranty. That's not a good start. Acer has not responded yet and I do not have an Acer repair center in my state anyway, so it looks like I will be without this PC for several weeks either way.Not the best time for such an inconvenience. I have to order another computer to ensure I can still get my work done. NOT COOL! Essentially, a costly situation using money I was not prepared to spend. That's why I bought this unit - hoping I wouldn't run into such situations. But, I guess I'll end up with TWO expensive computers for the lesson. What was the lesson? Well, I should have gone with my first choice.If you look on the web, you'll find NUMEROUS forums talking about this unit's fan issues. I rolled the dice and lost. DO YOUR RESEARCH and have a backup if you take this road. I'll update you again and let you know whether I was taken care of by Acer.UPDATE 3/15/21 - The laptop returns after about two weeks - but not per the instructions that I had provided. It was sent to the wrong address and I needed to go chase it down. NOT COOL! It also came back with a few more scratches than I was prepared to see and the repair notes were vague at best. However, it does sound better and the fan seems to be working. Considering that I had to buy another laptop, I suppose this one will make a good gift. Probably the last time I buy an Acer product.",0
Absolutely loving our new Helios. Gaming graphics are crisp and we can’t wait to start video editing on this high performance computer. What a dream.,0
Satisfied,0
"For a few days was a nice Chromebook, then doesn't start or power up again, don't buy it, and is not a cheap Chromebook, is USD200 exactly what this is. First and Last Time I bought any ASUS device, next time I will buy DELL That always have real GLOBAL WARRANTY not only US WARRANTY and I forgot the Chine ASUS junk",0
The price of this gaming laptop is super. I bought it for gaming and work. It is very powerful and quality laptop. I run all AAA games without a problem. Battery does not last long but I did not expected it will last long. I advise you to buy it. Great choice for this money.,0
"After researching gaming laptops for weeks, it came down to specs and this laptop beat all others, and for the price it was the clear choice. Dell wanted over a month of shipping time. I was able to get this beast of a laptop in just 2 days. Gaming with this right out of the box I was in the 300fps in R6 siege Max settings and it crushes all other games. Best purchase in years",0
This laptop was amazing. It did everything I needed it to do and I was enjoying it...for the first 3 days of course. Then out of nowhere the GPU fan just stops turning on. The GPU in the Predatorsense application showed a temperature of 92C at one point and the fan still did not turn on. Put on Turbo mode and nothing. Changed setting manually still nothing. I was really enjoying this laptop but that happened with the Fan. I would probably expect it from a year of use but this is supposed to be brand new.,0
Bought this as a gift.,0
"The lid on this thing has been broken for most of the time my wife has owned it. The hinges inside are very cheap and weak. The thing will not close because the hinges are broken on it, Also you cannot print easily form it. I bought my wife a standard laptop so she could print her coupons to the printer. This Chromebook is not a good product in my opinion.",0
Like everything about this laptop,0
great laptop for a good price too!,0
"I bought this laptop for my own personal use as a portable workstation when I need to work remotely for work. I have other laptops, but I believed that this would be a suitable replacement for two aging laptops with poor battery life.Problems I have with the laptop:The laptop you get has a 1.x ghz processor versus a 2.5 ghz processor as advertised.You DO NOT get 1-year of Office 365 at no charge with this laptop, just a one month trial.It does a terrible job of running Windows 10.After nearly a month of usage I have regulated this to a Linux workstation. I am currently running Xubuntu 18.10 on the device and it performs quite well given the actual specs of the hardware. Photos and documents load quickly and moderate web browsing is quite possible. The downside of running Linux over Windows is that you lose access to video streaming sites like WWE Network or Spectrum. It would have been nice to watch the football games over the weekend on my laptop.At this stage I am seriously considering a do-over on this purchase and getting a full refund.",0
The Bluetooth connectivity is nice.,0
Love the price and quality. Is working as if brand new.,0
"This one sucks! There is no way to install Linux on it. Disabled Secure Boot, disabled fast boot, and even manually change the boot option in BIOS. Still won't boot from Linux Mint 20 USB stick. My other laptops, including even several ASUS from a couple of years ago, had no problem in booting into LInux from the same stick. So disappointed that ASUS even design such things that only work with Windows. Time to return and move on to something else ...",0
"I've been using this computer (Lenovo Yoga 720 2-in1 12.5"", Intel Core i5-7200U, 8 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD Windows 10) for over a month. I bought it after my old laptop died in less than three years and this was the most affordable option available on Amazon and other websites with the kind of specs I wanted. I must say it exceeded my expectations and I'm really happy with it so far. It has a compact design that looks and feels sleek and sturdy at the same time. I find the display really bright and clear, but I don't work with photo apps etc. Touchscreen works well, though I've never tried it with a stylus yet. Tablet mode works well too and I love the practicality of it. Battery life is okay for a computer in this price range with this kind of processor, in my experience it goes from 100% to about 30% in 4,5-5 hours with constant moderate use, 50% screen brightness and WiFi on. The charger is really light so it's not a problem carrying it with me. No overheating--it doesn't heat up very often and it never gets uncomfortably hot. Speakers aren't very good, though, and the fingerprint reader isn't super fast, in my experience it usually takes 2-3 tries for it to read my finger.",0
"We bought this laptop for our son to join in gaming with us and for him to use for school. It has been great for gaming. The graphics are beautiful and there is no lag. Our only real issue is the fan Which can get very loud. We’ve purchased a cooling pad which helps a little, but it’s still louder than we would like.",0
I love this computer. It is very light and easy to travel with. It is not air cooled so not hot bottom or the noise of a fan cooling system. Was super easy to set up.,0
Laptop is as advertised. The build quality is great and airflow is great.,0
Al poco tiempo de uso la pantalla muestra distorsiones en la imagen. Envié a reparación y luego de 4 MESES de correos e insistencias telefónicas me han enviado el computador EN LAS MISMAS CONDICIONES. Es una falta absoluta de seriedad del servicio técnico que nos ha dado constantes largas. Lo peor es el dinero gastado y los problemas ya que es una herramienta de trabajo.No me resuelven el problema y Amazon me indica que no puede hacer nada al respecto.,0
Well worth the money.,0
"I've been using my new ASUS VivoBook computer for over a week and have a few comments. First, it's a great computer for those folks who like to work in the dark. The contrast between the silver keys and the lighted characters is poor at best. Key F7 allows four settings for the brightness of the characters, but the brightest one is still too dim. I find it easy to see the keyboard if I work in a dimmed setting. I've owned two ASUS computers previously and both have had excellent keyboard contrast. Why did they change to a poor contrast keyboard? Without this fault I would give it a 5 star rating.This is sold as a portable computer. At five pounds it might be better described as transportable.This computer does NOT have a touch screen as is advertised by Amazon. This is a good screen if you don't like looking at finger prints.Going to ASUS for help sends you to a ""paid-for"" tech group. This is a helluva way to provide support and ASUS should be ashamed!",0
"De las mejores laptops que he tenido, muy recomendada",0
I loved it,0
"Lo que más me agrada de la laptop es la calidad del ensamble y lo rápido que corren los juegos. Mi hijo instaló el simulador de vuelo de Microsoft y funciona de maravilla. Los únicos contras de la laptop son: i) duración de la batería y ii) peso del equipo y del cargador. Este último parece un ladrillo, literalmente.",0
Such a perfect little computer. Very happy.,0
"My daughter was begging for a Mac computer and now that she has this chromebook, she is so happy. It is sleek, lightweight and fully functional for her needs. She is thrilled with the ease of use and getting to know this operating system is a snap.",0
It work great for him all year long.,0
"Me encanto, me sirve muy bien para juegos, para trabajar y verdaderamente una excelente inversión",0
"My 12 yr old daughter received for this for Christmas and it was exactly what she wanted. It never left the house, was never dropped or banged around, and nothing was ever spilt on it. She basically only used it got School work and to watch You Tube and Netflix. Within 3 months, half of the screen turned black for no apparent reason. We haven’t been able to fix the problem or use it since. That was the 1 big item she wanted and it didn’t even make it until Easter!! VERY disappointing!!",0
"the battery simply not working properly, to missing nearly all the required video drivers and windows updates",0
I didnt like anything the thing never worked it showed up with maxed memory i couldnt do a thing with it its totally worthless i might use it for a sinker to go fishing,0
Bought to replace my husband's that the keyboard went out on. So far he really likes it.,0
"Garbage.. First laptop had faulty USB ports that failed within a month of purchase. Product was returned for an identical laptop( hooray Amazon return policy😃), which promptly died about 45 days later(😠). One equipment failure can be attributed to bad luck. Two separate units failing within 2 months of purchase on a $1000 product is unacceptable. Potential purchasers should consider another product.",0
Nice product,0
"For the price and the specs, you would expect LG to properly check that all of the components work as expected. Well I can tell you from first hand experience that it seems like they don't. The laptop is light, and when the battery has charge, it does work as expected, but unfortunately the battery does not keep a charge, and after the battery ran out, that was it for the laptop. Shame on LG for not doing their work right. I guess I won't be buying LG ever again.",0
Poor design - lid is too heavy for the hinges and causes the lower chassis to crack on each side from the stress and the lid will no longer close properly.,0
"There is only one major con of this laptop...Battery Life. It sucks 2 hours unplugged, maybe a bit more if you tweak it! Having said that I still give a five star review why? Cause everything else about the laptop is solid!Screen: beautiful, bright and fast.The keyboard: A joy to type on!Overall build Quality: No deck flex, the hinge is sturdy, stiff and a one hand open job. The weight is just north of 4.4 lbs (at least that's what my kitchen scale says :). Its aesthetic is perfect for the 'mature' gamer.The Cooling performance: The fans never get loud and for me are barely audible at the high performance preset. Laptop stays cool to the touch.Gaming performance: superb for the price (I got it at a one time low price) Anything around $1000 is a great bargain. I was looking at the Legion 5 or the Helios 300...but couldn't bring myself to pay almost $200 more for a RTX 2060 and a 4 zone RGB keyboard! You are looking at very comparable performance in most cases and the legion even lets you do some basic overclocking if you are so inclined.The Lenovo Vantage built-in software allows for a level of customization that is actually useful and allows you to very easily change settings to suit your tasks....this includes switching between integrated of dedicated graphics.All in all I would very highly recommend this laptop. I waited a month before I did this review in case any funny business happened. But thus far the only glitch I discovered is a very rare stuttering of the cursor (happened 3 times in four weeks of daily use) that I will continue to monitor. But I really am happy with the purchaseUpdate 1 month Later: the little glitch with the cursor hasn't happened since my initial review thankfully so I feel confident to say it was an anomaly. Still satisfied with the overall performance and feel of the laptop...and still wished it had a bigger battery but alas.......would purchase again!Update 6 months later: still loving it. The smaller batter capacity and relatively short battery life of 3 or so hours is offset by the ridiculously convenient fast charge feature'; this things charges as fast as my Samsung galaxy phone! The performance continues to be satisfactory and honestly with the prices that you see these days for laptops you really can't go wrong with this one! Lenovo hit a home run here!",0
"There are many great things about this machine. It's lightweight, with good battery life, and a super quick boot time. However, it has a regularly recurring sleep mode error which necessitates a force shutdown. This happens once every few days, and is a huge hassle for everyday functionality.",0
It's like a Christmas toy from years ago. You get it and it might last 2 or 3 months.,0
I got this item during the Prime Days.This little thing has EVERYTHING i need and want and is so compact. I have a docking station and when I am home I plug it in to a large monitor. ( yeah I am50 and need my readers bc is small BUT I LOVE IT!!),0
"Bought the Chromebook for my son for school and it is perfect for him. He uses it every day and it works great! I couldn't really leave an accurate star rating for games, because that is not what the intended use is for. My son can easily navigate Google classroom and hasn't had any issues when video chatting with teachers.",0
"Perfect, everything I wanted in a laptop. Product description is accurate, it arrive quickly, on perfect condition. The back lit keyboard is wonderful for typing in dim light.",0
"This is a good budget/starter laptop tthat has great potential. I like the screen size and the fact that this is quick for having a lower tier CPU. I immediately upgraded the SSD to a larger 256 GB Drive. I have never personally had an Acer laptop but I have used them and worked on them in the past and this is one is on par with my previous experiences. The screen is bright and sharp and the OS is quick, at least until it gets bloated with all the junk we acquire. Over all, this is a really snappy machine and I'm pleased with it's performance. I tried set this to dual boot with Linux but I couldn't get it running right so I went back to just Windows. This is a great budget laptop with a crisp display, which is really nice for us older folks! I'll come back to update my review if anything changes my opinion on this unit",0
okay I will start with the good about Apple.. my daughters last laptop lasted 10 years(2 batteries and the pad cracked).. started failing.. we bought her this new 2022 Macbook Air laptop M2.. it weighs very little like a heavy cell phone.. also doesn't heat up as much.. so far has worked just like her last one so far pretty good.. the new operating system software made it impossible to move her Office products over so she put in LibreOffice which is free and it mimics Office pretty well.. it uses USB 4 Thunderbolt ports and you have to buy adapters to use USB drives etc.. they're pretty cheap so not a big problem.. there's a new 1 TB flash drive for a good price(30$) on Amazon right now.. adds storage and backup.. has dual USB 3 and 4 which will work on this laptop.. USB 4 is Thunderbolt.. if you like Apple and need new laptop for 1200 bucks you should get this one..,0
From opening and closing the laptop various times the wire for the video camera fails if you don’t have it at a certain viewing angle. I didn’t do my research properly but the video camera wire is notorious for failing in this particular modal.,0
Good value for money. I bought it as a machine for my teenage child to do homework and study with and its pretty good.,0
Got it to my pictures on. Thought it was like a small laptop. No it is like a large ipod. So it will not work for what I wanted. So I'm not using it.,0
Waste of money. Bought this for my son’s distance learning and audio functions are not compatible with video platforms such as Zoom.,0
Excellent. Product arrived as expected. It os a powerful laptop!,0
Excellent!,0
This is a great computer for light work or for making a few songs if you want a gaming laptop though this isn’t it also I have seen people complaining about not being able to get out of windows 10 s but I did it fairly easy and was able to download chrome and other things with no problems,0
"The computer worked well for about 10 months, then it started freezing and crashing. I called Microsoft (it was running windows 10), they identified the ASUS keyboard driver as the problem. But often the stop code was ""WHEA_uncorrectable_error"". I called ASUS about the problem, they offer repairs that take 2 weeks. Save yourself all the phone calls, fear of losing your data, and general misery and BUY SOMETHING ELSE. Plus customer support was garbage, they flat out denied the existence of any widespread issue when a simple google search proves the opposite.",0
"Pros:The screen is awesome. I really can make use of the extra 240 lines in height.Quiet - I put the fans on the low noise option and it's wonderfulFast! Both computationally and moving stuff off of external SSD.Supports extending to external 4K monitor, and GPU's work there.Cons:[These are really minor, but I wanted to put them here hoping that ASUS will read them, and for some it may be useful]1) I am right handed. My mouse lives on the right side of my laptop. I wish the power and HDMI cables, and high speed USB-C, could be on the left side, away from my right hand and mouse. See picture. But if you are left handed - this layout is a winner. [I've ordered a right angle HDMI cable to help]Update: I found a great video cable, look for Flexible HDMI to HDMI Cable Left Angled 90°, it made a big difference.2) The touch pad is a full inch below the space bar. For those of us who have trained on using the touchpad, we want to be able to use it with your thumb, while keeping our palms and fingers in typing position. On my previous laptop, it was only 3/8"". I'm still able to work the pad, so I'm not subtracting from the stars, but if you have smaller hands, you might want to check this, if you want to use it this way. Also -- I think this is one of those things with the visual appeal took precedence over the user comfort. I really want the designers to consider this use case.",0
This computer started malfunctioning 2 months after it was ordered. It has not broken completely and no longer works. My son had it for 4 months.,0
I absolutely love this pc. I am a big gamer and it runs smooth as butter.,0
I have only had this for a couple days but I love it. I went from a macbook to this and expected to be disappointed. I didn't have to adjust any of the settings or anything with this laptop. I logged into my gmail and everything was perfect. So far I have no complaints. I can't believe how inexpensive it was.,0
I was able to receive the codes after two days of receiving the machine.,0
There was an issue with the power cord in the original shipment. The issue was handled promptly and resolved easily.,0
The feel and look is impressive from the start.,0
I wanted to love this and it runs smoothly but the camera is very grainy and low quality. I was going to send it back but the seller will add a 20% restocking fee which would be around 60.00 ..so if the camera is important to you Id skip this laptop and get another,0
the keyboard lights are nice,0
"This computer has been excellent. It is very powerful and performs phenomenally for a wide variety of applications, ranging from gaming to school to work. Battery life is the only aspect that can be considered a slight downside, however, by dimming the screen brightness and turning off the keyboard, the battery life can be extended to several hours. The estimated battery life can go as high as 8-9 hours by setting the computer to power-saving mode through the Control Center 3.0 software that comes with it. Another good feature of this laptop is the fact that it has a numpad, as many smaller laptops lack. Overall, this computer was and still is an excellent purchase. Do not hesitate to buy it.",0
"Excelente, conforme con las prestaciones del equipo, opte por comprar con envío a mi país Chile, llego en menos de una semana. Todo el proceso es informado por dhl, se paga un poco mas pero valio completamente la pena.",0
Amazing,0
"Screenpad is Amazing !! Just that would make it worth the buy !People complaining about it doesn't have a clue on how to use it. It's a great great addition that is underappreciated.I wish the SSD would be at least 1TB out of the shelf. No complaints at all, go for it",0
If you need to do a lot of work don’t order. I use this as aback up for work when I don’t want to lug my big one around or out of town,0
My daughter it,0
"Bought this from another retailer and was very disappointed to discover that you can't get google Play Store on this device. What the heck is it good for then?! I have a smaller touchscreen HP Chromebook that works great and has Play Store, but I wanted one with a larger screen. I'm returning this device tomorrow.BTW, I checked with HP, because of hardware limitations, Play Store can not be downloaded to the device even if you try to a different build channel (developer, beta).",0
"No fue para mí, fue una compra para mi hermano.La computadora está preciosa, el color está muy bonito, es muy ligera, la carga dura mucho… el único problema es que viene en inglés y es una lata estar configurándola para cambiarle el idioma porque no cambia todo y es un lío hacerla coincidir con el teclado, que no es latinomericano.",0
"Light weight. Fast, especially on startup. No problem with the black on grey keyboard lettering. No touchscreen, whatever. I knew I wasn't going to like the track pad for the mouse, so dropped $20 on trackball, nbd. What I didn't expect was that one month after purchase machine would completely lose the wifi card. Like gone. One day woke up, no wifi, no driver, no hardware, NO ICON. Nothing. Can't find it. OS troubleshoot says connect ethernet cable. THERE IS NO ETHERNET PORT ON MACHINE. Didn't think I'd need one, features went on and on about how blazing fast the wifi was. What wifi? No wifi here. Randomly had a cheap usb wifi dongle in a drawer, amazing luck. Connect to internet. Run windows update, wifi back! Hooray! Two days later, where's the wifi? What wifi? No wifi here. Doesn't look like there ever was. Back to the dongle. Run windows update, nothing. Uh oh. Update drivers, nothing. Update BIOS, nothing. Uninstall / reinstall drivers, nothing. HP diagnostic program is a joke. Won't run unless I'm connected to the internet. What? How's that supposed to help troubleshoot connection issues? Device manager has no hardware/drivers. Not even hidden ones. Hours of research on the internet. Tried a bunch of command prompt stuff people said worked for them. Nothing. Countless restarts. Long story short error 45 accross the board, no hardware detected. I'm giving up. 1 month into my 2 year protection program, but not worth time or energy to send back. Dropped $35 on a better wifi dongle, gonna roll with that for time being. Now both usb a ports are in use (mouse and wifi). Not happy! If anything else goes wrong, will change review to one star. Tldr; SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH WIFI HARDWARE!!! USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PURCHASING!!!",0
"I was looking everywhere for a laptop that didn't cost an arm and a leg, but was made well enough that I knew it'd last an ok amount of time. I think I finally hit the nail on the head! This laptop's specs for the price are just awesome! I almost went with another brand of computer, but I think it's worth paying a little extra money for longevity, better quality, and better customer service. Not to mention, the Lenovo backpacks they make for them are pretty awesome.",0
"From graphic speed to processor speed to hard drive capacity, I couldn't have made a better purchase. The Rose Gold is beautiful. This converts to a tablet with the stylus included - it switches without hesitation. It is a bit heavy, but only by ounces.",0
"Very happy with the performance for the price. Screen is crystal clear, after learning the operation of Chromebook I love this product.",0
"Fantastically easy setup, sufficient processing speed, webcam, HDMI port, HD screen display and not too much bloatware preloaded. A great little powerhouse with a very reasonable price, I'm sold so far!",0
I loooooooive this MacBook but I need a mouse. Can you show me one that is actually the same shade of “gold” … this isn’t really gold. I love it but…I would like a mouse that matches. The touch is wonderful and it’s my weird hand that needs a mouse. Can someone match up this colour correctly?,0
"It runs great and looks good while doing it. I haven't had any problems running multiple tabs. Its a little slow after startup for 2-3 minutes, then is fine.",0
I have tried to adjust sound but you cannot hear if you are not right in front of it. even then the sound is very low. I have to use subtitles.,0
"This Laptop is incredible. If you're a gamer who has a budget, I'd definitely recommend this laptop. It's light weight, has a very good amount of batterry life, and can run most games at 80-120+ fps (at least from my experience). The Laptop looks nice and has a nice slim design. The fans are a bit loud, but it's easy to deal with when you're gaming with a headset. Overall, this is a great laptop that anyone could enjoy playing on. It'll also make a great gift.",0
Amazing product. Great for all my home pc meeds and more.,0
"Very bad, bought expensive laptop but very disappointed it sent in open box",0
"It is slow and web pages ""jitter"" and takes forever to load. Not worth the price",0
This laptop is stylish and has served me well both in high-school and college.,0
Copy of windows 10 it’s not a registered one.Power cord overheats,0

"I especially like the cooling potential during high stress use. I had never seen so much vent area on a laptop. The battery life is a joke when using extreme performance mode. However, the battery holds up fine for browsing the internet for hours in battery saver mode. I like the per key rgb lighting. I can adjust both color and intensity of the keyboard. The portability is great and the number pad is a must for work.",0
"Awesome laptop with a super low price for what you get. The battery is not to durable but it’s what you get when you buy an H CPU. You can upgrade this computer for less than buy a new one. And about the seller, they ship fast and I’ve been using this computer for a month and everything is as spected. I’m happy with this buy",0
"Use case is AI and GPU accelerated machine learning for Windows and Linux. Upgraded memory from 16GB to 64GB using Crucial dual SODIMM 64GB kit, model CT2K32G4SFD832A. Upgraded SSD to dual ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro 1TB for dual booting (Fn F10) Windows and Linux. Both hardware upgrades working great, no glitches.As of this time, Ubuntu 20.04 installs (Safe graphics mode install). No other distro worked. I tried Debian Buster 10.4 and Proxmox, no luck. I believe they're failing due to graphics incompatibility. There's a couple device issues with current Ubuntu 20.04 (kernel 5.4). Touchpad and brightness don't work. The community has been active in discovering the issue and providing a work-around. I used gist from jbuncle/build-patched-kernel.sh to rebuild the kernel to 5.9 which included touchpad patches. Took 45m but it did build 5.9 and fixed touchpad and brightness. Great job jbuncle! Generally there's some annoyances with Linux but no showstoppers.I'm very pleased with the noise level in quiet mode. The 144Hz display is really good and bright enough for anything other than sunny days outdoors.Update 28-Oct-2020: Using Ubuntu 20.04 (kernel 5.9), bluetooth driver zombies every 10 minutes or so. Workaround is to pair the device over and over again or just use wired earphones.Update 29-Oct-2020: Caution! CrystalDiskInfo reports 2nd NVME SSD temps as high as 74C during CrystalDiskMark write operations. Be sure to use good heatsinking and verify they're working. My drive (ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro) uses a manufacturer supplied heatsink. The drives cools down the instant write benchmarks complete. When using CrystalDiskInfo, use F5 to update temps.Update 7-Dec-2020: Linux doesn't output an image to HDMI although the external monitor is recognized. Windows output works as expected. Must be an NVidia driver issue with v455. v440 looks like it turns on backlight but also no image. This is really a showstopper as I was hoping to use gpu-passthough to a client VM.Update 11-Dec-2020: Tried several updated Linux distributions. They're getting closer to everything working but none are perfect yet. I'm sticking with Ubuntu for now but eagerly waiting for HDMI output to get fix. HDMI is working on some other distributions such as Manjaro and OpenSuse so perhaps soon for Ubuntu.",0

First they send us a laptop that was broke. After loading it. We noticed that nothing was loading up that came up on my laptop I bought a few weeks ago thru somewhere else. It was the same one except it was a smaller harddrive. The screen was pixeled and was forced to reboot the pc when that happened an error kept coming up. And was not able to get back into it. It's obvious they gave us someone else's crappy pc. And the box was damaged. To pay that money and get screwed over is wrong.,0

Purchased this laptop in November 2021. It is still under warranty but the HP website lists repair sites of UbreakIfit it. None of these sites would repair connectivity issues under the warranty. Spent three hours online with HP support tech and still unable to access the internet. We've always been satisfied with HP devices - no longer! The Amazon support CS did NOT offer to help provide a three way call to HP to fix the issue just gave us the HP 800 number. Sorry we purchased this laptop thru Amazon.,0

While the model is light and is fairly comfortable to work with, the biggest attraction for this model was the promised battery life. I am quite disappointed with the very poor battery life of fewer than 5 hours. This is less than a third or fourth of what I was expecting. I am currently based in the Philippines and would like Samsung to pay attention to this problem. Not sure if the issue is with my unit or it is applicable to all the units. This is one of the costlier units and Samsung may want to guard its reputation for its premium product.",0

"OVERALLThis is a really solid productivity ultrabook, with nice features that make it feel high end. It's designed to be lightweight, and push wireless connectivity. The largest issue I have with it however, is temperature management. To fully take advantage the capability of the CPU, this laptop needs some assistance with cooling.TEMPS/COOLINGWhen pushing this laptops CPU (which is a great CPU) the temps get pretty high. I played Civ 6 on this PC which it could handle (see more about graphics below). But Civ can get pretty CPU heavy the farther into the game you get. I've got a screenshot here with temps and you can see it sometimes got as high as 95 C. At one point when playing and charging at the same time, the entire game crashed and the laptop rebooted – I have to assume this is about the temps so from then on I had to be more careful. I also use this laptop in bed and it'll make my bare legs red so it definitely needs a fully flat surface like a tea tray or something – ideally with a cooling pad.POLISH/QUALITY OF LIFE FEATURESThere are a lot of quality of life features that I really enjoy. The fingerprint reader for sign-in is nice. I don't care for facial recognition in my technology for a lot of reasons so having the fingerprint option is great and it works very reliably. You can also add multiple fingers to it. The touchscreen is very responsive and accurate, being able to swipe to go back in a web browser for example, is really nice when just browsing. It is very thin and super light so it's portability is excellent. There are some Dell features that might be worth your time, they might not – an integration for using your cell phone with the computer is one of them. There is quite a bit of bloatware out of the box which is annoying. The charging cable has a light at the end so you know if it's plugged in which is a small thing, but adds to the polish of the product. Overall it feels like they tried to make a product that could compete with a macbook air and while I am not a macbook person, I do feel like where they landed was not as premium as a macbook air, but still a VERY good ultrabook.IRIS XEI also ran a timespy benchmark and my numbers were better than the other reviewers. I am not sure what on earth could be contributing to such disparate results. The Iris Xe is being marketed as integrated graphics that don't make compromises. While this isn't a gaming rig and I would never use it as such, if you are a gamer who travels and you want to be able to game on the road this might work if you temper your expectations. If you are a PC gamer you can also stream games to it from your gaming rig while sitting on the couch in another room so that's also an option, depending on the game. I have had a good experience so far, but I've also only tried games that I felt comfortable it could handle (like turn based games). I did try to push it and loaded up Valheim and was met with an atrocious 9-12 fps. In addition to the integrated graphics, the other limiting factor here is, can you mitigate the heat? Because gaming is a battery drain, you'll be probably using it while plugged in, also while the CPU is cranked up. So a cooling pad is probably going to be necessary unless it's in short bursts like a 30 minute train ride for commuters.PORTSThe I/O on here is super bare bones. Just two thunderbolt ports, an aux, and microSD. It IS nice to be able to charge from either side of the laptop. But because of the streamlined I/O and the fact that this is a productivity laptop first and foremost, you'll probably need a hub or docking station to make this usable in an office environment. I have been using a Bluetooth mouse and that's been very responsive so cutting cords with peripherals is an option but connecting to power and multiple screens will likely still require a dock.STORAGETo my knowledge the storage is not expandable but it is replaceable. So you could ostensibly upgrade to a larger NVME if you'd like but you're looking at migrating all your stuff and reinstalling windows etc. to do it. 512 GB is not a lot, however with increasing amounts of cloud storage being utilized, it might be find for a typical productivity user that doesn't focus on video or photo.BEST POSSIBLE USE CASESo who is this laptop for? I imagine it's for a commuting office worker first and foremost. The compact size is really only necessary if you will be moving it around. If you'll have it plugged in to a dock and mounted all day every single day, then I really don't see the point in accepting so few ports. Not being able to plug in even a USB flashdrive without an adapter (it does come with one) is a huge pain for some people, so the portability really needs to be worth it. Otherwise, I'd get another laptop with similar specs that has a better set of ports on the side. It IS forward thinking with the Thunderbolt ports though and as technology marches forward, we will see more accessories and peripherals that rely on USB C/Thunderbolt. Like I said, if you won't be traveling with this laptop or taking it home with you regularly, I'd suggest a slightly thicker, slightly heavier laptop with similar specs but that's just me. Overall, this is an excellent laptop. It performs very well for what it's made to do – which is primarily productivity work. The display is lovely, the touch screen is responsive. All the features work without having to fight to get them to. The camera is pretty terrible in low light, it's less atrocious when you're well lit. Also the bezel is so thin that I don't think it would be easy to find a shutter small enough to cover the camera and not block any part of the display.",0

"This is just about my ideal laptop and even the few things I don't completely love aren't that much of a pain. The whole thing has a premium feel which is great in a world where so many laptops are all plastic. Aluminum plus a soft touch carbon fiber look is a win here. The screen has all the detail I want with plenty of brightness. Viewing angles are great so while this isn't exactly cinema size if you have someone else looking on they can see no matter where they are. Performance wise I've been able to get everything I needed done: Light gaming, browsing, high def video. No problem. For a laptop the keyboard is just fine. Not mechanical feeling but a crisp click nonetheless. Ports are a bit limited but I have to say I've gotten very used to only having USB-C and a headphone jack. They do provide a small dongle so if you will need something plugged in while you're out I find just keeping the dongle attached to whatever the device you're bringing is or keep it in a bag. The only real complaint I have is the battery life. Somewhat understandable in something with an i7 in it but don't expect to be out all day using it if you dont have somewhere to plug in. I don't find myself out like that too much so realistically it's not a problem but it does mean the battery is something you have to be conscious about. Beyond that it's a powerful, small, and well built laptop that can just be carried around like a small paper notebook. The compact size means I actually take it around with me as opposed to a 15"" that I only move if I have a specific purpose. It really is a sweet-spot in my opinion and I'd have no problem recommending this one to anyone.",0
I gave it to my wife for communicating with her friends.,0
"Excelente equipo, llego en excelente condiciones, no tuve ningun problema en configurarla y colocarle lo que uso para trabajo y para Gaming. Despues de hacer Benchmarks y pruebas con mi libreria de juegos recomiendo mucho este equipo.

Funciona rápida y eficientemente,0
"I've been using this laptop for a couple months now and it has mostly worked well. The speed is fast and the gaming performance has thus far proved worthy. I use it mostly for work and like to navigate quickly between various software.The biggest issues has been an ongoing problem with the wifi card randomly disconnecting from wifi connections that are stable for other devices, particularly when trying to download or stream large files/data. The other issue has been the screen/graphics card showing screen distortions or glitches a couple times per day. A few times the screen distorted to being unreadable and I had to hard power down the laptop to use it again. It resumed fine after this incident. These glitches occur with variations applications that use the graphics card for an enhanced experience (Excel, Chrome, etc.). Disabling graphics enhancement in the settings of these programs usually helps.The price was great for the components and I otherwise have enjoyed using this laptop. I hope it continues to run well for the long-term (time is the true test).",0
"got it for $850 on a pre BF deal. The screen is beautiful with a 144hz refresh rate. It has an excellent processor and graphics card which makes it great for gaming and for routine office work.

I have an old gaming computer that it just hanging on right now. This new ACER is an outstanding upgrade. I have already downloaded some games (one game in particular involving tanks but I am not sure I am free to say which game/company it is) and it is great. The keyboard (picture above) lights up so that's a plus when I decide to play with the lights dimmed or off in the room). It has the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 which runs the games at top speed.This is a top notch quality computer for gaming at a great price. Outstanding. Five stars from this user!,0

"Okay, so it does come with a 3060, however it is just the mobile. So don’t get too excited. This machine runs great so far. It has a wonderful display to my surprise. The key board layout is nice and quiet compared to other gaming laptops I’ve owned. Con- the battery will get you like 3 hours maybe 4 if you are smart. It’s heavy but not to heavy. Tbh the charger is also a little bulky. Also the ssd slot does not come with a spare bracket. Fun fact you can buy the bracket and copper heat plate on Amazon. You will need both if you wish to install a nicer ssd. Over all great machine for the price, especially if you wait for a sale.",0
"I love this laptop. Don't get windows 11. I found this laptop at a microcenter with a much better graphics card 3070 and a better battery life but I couldn't have it on hold as long as I needed to to go and get it. This computers battery is atrocious. Don't use while it's unplugged for a long time. It comes pre loaded with a lot of bloatware. I downloaded a third party application that makes it so that way you can lower the refresh rate to 60htz or your computer dies from full charge in 30 minutes. After making it so I can switch from 165htz -> 60htz the battery life lasts about 3 hours more. Like any other gaming laptop, it gets extremely hot. Oh and back to the refresh rate, this is advertised as 165htz which looks great but if you go to change it in window's settings, you can't change it to anything else. That's why I downloaded that other software. It's upgradable which is why I got it. I put in another ssd, of course you have to partition but it works perfectly. I put more ram in, and it's a beast, but with power distribution (because it's a laptop) the hardware will never be completely utilized to the fullest unless you overclock everything while plugged in. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE IT PLUGGED INTO IT'S GIGANTIC, HEAVY BRICK CHARGER IT'S COMPLETELY WORTH IT!",0
"It has a large trackpad, which is godsend for someone who usually uses Macs.",0

Recently I got into Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, which is gorgeous on this laptop.Work: I am also a college student, and this machine is amazing for that too. Its start up time and loading time for everything is very fast, the keyboard is crisp and responsive, and the keyboard lights up in case you need to work at night with no additional lights.Cons: when not plugged in the battery life is not amazing, maybe about ~2-2.5 hours typing a paper while listening to YouTube, but not terribly short.Overall: 5/5, would highly recommend.",0

Awesome! Replacement for an old workhorse!,0
"I have had this Dell XPS 9500 for six months and it's a disaster.This is my third or fourth Dell laptop and both this one and its predecessor (a Dell Precision) have BIG problems. The biggest problem is that the battery swells. As you can see in the photos, as the battery swells, the touch pad starts to lift up and you can no longer click on it. Eventually the whole front of the case separates so you can no longer properly close the computer. More importantly, this is extremely dangerous because if the pouch of a lithium ion battery ruptures it will likely result in an explosion. This is totally unacceptable and never happened in the other brands of laptops I used over the years.Second, with the Dell XPS 9500 I have had frequent problems with the screen going mostly black, and I have to push down on the screen or wiggle it to get the screen to come back up. A Dell service person said they fixed it by updating my drivers but the nature of the problem (and the fact that wiggling the monitor makes it come back to life) makes me think this probably isn't a driver problem. Only time will tell (I just had the drivers updated a few days ago).Third, the headphone jack doesn't work. It only had hissing and static, and then I had an in-home Dell service call and they replaced the bottom of the computer and now there is no sound from the headphone jack at all. On top of that, the person lost three of the screws from the bottom of the computer and only screwed in one of the other five about halfway.Last but not least, this computer was chosen for me by my employer and when it arrived I discovered it only had USB-C ports -- no regular USB ports. Since all of my peripherals are USB (microphone, mouse, tablet, ring light, MIDI keyboard), I have to use an adapter dongle for absolutely everything, and the dongle won't power the MIDI keyboard. It's beyond frustrating.All in all, this computer has been way too much trouble and I'm going to try to have my employer return it and I will avoid Dells until there is some evidence they have solved their quality control problems.",0

"This laptop spec wise is fantastic, I bought the computer mostly for Flight Simulator. Which is works flawless, fans can make a little noise when you are running games and such but nothing that I mind at all, especially considering this is all in a laptop chassis. Also the fans do no run at full blast regardless. (Unit has a lot of ventilation on the bottom). The screen is very nice with great color reproduction, much better than the Acer I tried previously. To top it off there is the RGB keyboard which is very cool and fun to customize. Spec wise you know what you are getting, great processor with just about the best video card you can get. Highly recommend the laptop. On the downsides, the bottom although pretty feels plasticky, which is odd because the lid is very well finished. Second, my daughter stole it on day one to play Valorant and Other games. So I hope I get to you use the computer I bought for myself and it isn't kidnapped by family members.",0

"I have to be honest, I was very let down by the initial mis-labeling of these chromebooks. I bought two of these as graduation presents for my brother and sister who just graduated high school. I searched and searched for a better deal than the initial one on this chromebook. Having initially said it had a 500Gb hard drive. I seemed to good to be true, and it was, after having received them the description on amazon changed to the original 16Gb drive. I should have known better as chromebook are always this way. it was too much of a hassle to return them, so I gave them to my siblings anyway. They seem to enjoy them, as they primarily seem to only be useful for web surfing. no document storage, no central ""hub"" if you will like on a regular laptop, only chrome and online storage. you get what you pay for I suppose, I was very let down again, I recommend for extra storage a 128Gb micro sd card, or an external hard disk.",0

"This laptop would be great if the monitor wasn't so terrible. I had backlight bleed watching movies no matter how I set the brightness or contrast. Two of these were defective. I sure hope they don't consider this bleeding acceptable. My 6 year old Asus it replaced has darker black and no spill and it was only about 400 dollars. Too bad. This thing loads fast, is light weight, has plenty of power for work and play, but it's just terrible for doing any work with night charts, movies or anything other than surfing web pages. One computer had problems bleeding from the top left corner, bottom right and center. This one has some bleeding from the bottom left and just right of center. It is distracting and annoying. Completely unacceptable in this day and age. Frustrating as all heck. Thankfully, Amazon customer service processed my rant and is taking good care of me.Honestly, I would not purchase an asus product again after this experience. Quality control is extremely important in technology.",0
"Encourage you not to buy this item. The one I received came with an inherent defect. Fans are too loud and the laptop gets really quickly, which leads to horrible performance and FPS drop. The seller did not refund me full. Moreover, this cheap seller deducted money from me making me the one who damaged it. But I received the laptop damaged. Do not buy this rubbish guys, especially from this seller",0
"So I purchased this laptop from Razer.com because it's the only way to get RazerCare. Which I hope I will never need, but based on the reviews of previous Blade generations and this one, it seemed like a necessity. Especially when spending $3,000 on a laptop (I bought the 4K model).So far though about a week of owning it, absolutely zero problems. This laptop was out of stock the night before I wanted it and was in stock the next morning, so it must be a fresh off the assembly line machine. Which hopefully means any of the problems you see from reviews in the summer are less relevant (hopefully). That or I just got a great machine (so far). I can't find any flaws though and I absolutely love using the thing. Coming from a Macbook Pro that I was running in boot camp 90% of the time because I'm an architect and I live in a Windows world, I am satisfied with a beautiful device that is well designed and has a keyboard that, while it has taken some adjustment, I really love the feel of it. I'm not perfect with it yet by any means. Mainly because the keys are small and the space between them is larger than my Surface Book (my other work machine) and my Macbook.This thing is a beast. I play Destiny 2 a lot and it devours it. Awesome. I have peace of mind because I own several computers, but this one has the potential to be my favorite, easily. I don't fully trust Razer yet, but having the RazerCare makes me feel good. Amazon offers their own warranty's through third parties and I considered them for sure, but ultimately was scared of that too.For what it's worth, I think it's asking a lot for a machine with zero problems at all. My Surface Book does weird stuff and my Macbook has suffer a faulty logic board. So nothing is perfect. And the Razer may fail. It does get hot and loud. But out of the box, it's everything I could have asked and hoped for.I will update this if anything bad happens. If I never update, you can assume I'm still smiling at the gorgeous 4K screen.",0
"I was told not to get this laptop, but I insited anyways. This is the perfect laptop for beginning gamers and can be used for all other things too! Good laptop for the price!",0
"I'm about 30 days in and so far I'm very happy with this machine. Asus only designates one ROG Strix SCAR each year and this one deserves the title.I got three of these, one for myself and one for each of my gamer girls. Yeah, it's a big Christmas. I'll update as time goes on as I will have the experiences of three users.Right now, I can say off the top of my head that if you're a power user, you can bypass the IGPU (integrated Radeon) using the USB-C 3.1 port in the back of the laptop. I got a USB-C to DP adapter and 4k graphics pour out fast directly from the DGPU (the Nvidia RTX 3080).I am also getting a USB-C hub to use as a docking station and also to read SD Cards. Yeah, the laptop doesn't have a card reader. It doesn't have a cam either. My heart is broken and bleeds peanut butter.You can find many, many USB videos about this stuff. Some of them get a little hyper about the 15 inch display being connected to the IGPU. Well, it's true. I used to think this was bad like many of the YouTubers. But there's no bottleneck that I can detect so I have to trust Asus knew what they were doing when they decided to architect it this way.Technically, routing the graphics from the DGPU to the IGPU to the laptop display is a little bit slower, but not in any noticeable way to me so far. And there's always using the back USB port to bypass the IGPU entirely.Also, we've been playing with the Oculus Quest 2 (or Meta Quest or whatever). So far it seems to be happier working directly off of the DGPU but I've heard there's a workaround for it to work off of the IGPU.UPDATE: 60 DaysSo I've had this machine for a little over 2 months and I'm still very happy with it. There's only one real problem that I found and it is with the Meta Quest VR. I don't know if this is a bug on the Asus side of things or if it lies with the Oculus App. The video signal seems to go to the headset either via Wi-Fi or direct USB cable link. That's called the Oculus Link and Air Link. For some reason the app wants to process that video with the integrated GPU which just doesn't work. You either get a black screen or just three dots waiting. There's an inelegant solution which is to simply go into the device manager of Windows and disable the integrated GPU. That will allow Air Link and Oculus Link to work because then they are able to use the dedicated GPU. That might make a couple of other things go wonky for you so be sure to enable the integrated GPU when you're done with PCVR.Right now the official story from Oculus is that it's all in beta anyway and that's great if you can get it to work but it's not officially supported yet. So this may all be a non-issue once it gets out of beta. Also, there's another solution called the Virtual Desktop which will allow PCVR to work. That is a separate paid app that you can get from the Oculus store. It streams the video to the headset independently of the Oculus link and Air Link. So that is a completely different way to do PCVR with the Quest. It's also not officially supported but seems to work great for lots of people.So that's just really one application (PCVR) that I've had an issue with. And I think it's a problem that will be solved once it's out of beta and they are able to make it use the dedicated GPU.Otherwise this laptop has been amazeballs and I still highly recommend it.Amazeballs.UPDATE: 1 YEAR LATERI am still loving this laptop. All the Meta Quest 2 (Oculus) issues have been resolved by Meta. After all, it was always their bug to fix. :)I finally found my first game that only gives me about 40 fps with all settings on ""ultra high"" quality. That's the new Plague's Tale game. I had to set the game at simply ""high"" quality and I'm back at 60 fps. Not like I'm worried, but we may yet see 60 fps on ""ultra high"" after some driver updates.",0
"This Laptop was purchased for my son to use for school, and I must say I myself is impress with the speeds and smooth feel when using this Hp laptop.",0
"The battery on mine lasts about an hour. Also, you can only go through Microsoft for apps. I tried to look at Google play but it took me to the Microsoft store instead.But the make and overall functions are otherwise pretty good.",0
"I have one of the earliest Chromebooks by Asus and I loved it. After years of heavy use, I have worked it to retirement. My other experience has been all Microsoft/Windows/Office, lovely but clumsy and ditsy with semi-incomprehensible directions. This Chromebook is all Google by Samsung, simple and intuitive to use. Instead of Office, it offers the same word processing and database spreadsheet, etc., with easily identifiable icons instead of the glitzy ribbon. It has all I need plus much more. And it all goes to the cloud, where nothing has been lost yet!I love the model with two cameras, converts to tablet, with notepad and stylus or tablet keyboard. Or I can use it as a tablet style internet connection. Loaded with (mostly) Google apps and extensions, everything I need is available.At first I feared there was no way to Zoom, but zoom.us has an app for Chromebook that looks better than my PC's.I recommend this for especially for students and people looking for a first time computer. And for those of us who've known this secret for a longer time! Note also, Samsung offers less expensive models with the same essentials. I just wanted some sparkle in my life!",0
I love this laptop!,0
The larger touch pad is a nice addition and allows easier movement across the screen without having to lift your finger and start again.,0
"I did almost newer use this laptop on battery, now it cannot charge the battery anymore it tells me that I have to replace it. It already the second laptop from hp that has this problem.",0
"Received the laptop 6 days ago. It crapped out this morning. Screen went dark with no warning. Initially the power and charging light worked. Then after a while they went dark too. Called for support on a Sat morning, they said no support until Monday.",0
"Super rápida, pantalla nitida, bateria sin problemas, se puede jugar a 1080p cualquier juego con excelentes fps.",0
the wifi connectivity was terrible. do not buy. save your money,0
I needed a new laptop in a pinch. Performance wise this isn’t a bad laptop. Problem I have is this thing runs HOT! Both the laptop and battery will get super hot to the touch. You can’t rest your hand and type bc your wrists start to burn. I’ve only had it 3 months and looking to replace it already.,0
"Very impressed, handles Assassin's Creed extremely well, diedy not even get hot, can play hours on end with no issues.",0
This laptop is a great value for your buck. Loads fast. Worth every cent.,0
Very good product,0
Best bang for the buck right here! I love this thing! It gets a little hot but you just run the turbo when that happens and it's good as new. I play this thing more than my desktop. I can play most games on ultra with it which is excellent. 10/10 would buy again.,0
Great laptop for all ages. I get annoyed when people say these are only for kids. I'm 30 and bought this for myself while I'm in school. All I do is browse the internet myself anyway. All my other media is on my Android phone. It's a great buy for us adults who are going back to school or just people who use the internet.,0
"Love the lightweight and easy to set up/configure capabilities. This is my first MAC although I have iPads and an Apple watch. Though it might be scary to move from Windows, but not at all. Like all Apple products - everything was seamless. Great price as well..",0
"I am very impressed with the Lenovo Y7000. I love the design, which is understated but still has some style thanks to some angled contours on the body, the matte finish, and the illuminated logo on the lid. It's not as geeky as most gaming laptops but looks handsome and can be used in professional settings without demanding attention. The build quality feels great, with some nice heft to the fairly thin unit. The screen/lid is very svelte and opens and closes smoothly without stressing or twisting thanks to a well-placed center hinge. Another design feature I like is the power cord attaching at the rear rather than on one side as is typical. I find that to be a better location that is more convenient, as side ports sometimes put you in an awkward position.The keys feel great. They're very responsive with just the right amount of resistance and travel. The numeric keypad is essential for me, as I use the laptop for bill paying, record keeping, etc. The keys are not back-lit if that matters to you. Not an issue for me. I love the feel of the touchpad too. It's responsive and not too stiff when you press & click. Like the keyboard, it feels just right.The screen looks good, with pleasing brightness, vibrant colors, no glare, and generous viewing angles. The speakers are not a strength, however. They only sound okay, providing clear sound but not much punch or volume. At full blast they are still not very loud. Thankfully they don't distort at all when turned on full bore.The performance is great. I am not a huge gamer, using the unit mainly for music recording, video editing, and general use, but my brother spent several days with it over Christmas playing Fortnite and it ran very smoothly with a consistently high frame rate using pretty high graphics settings. He's much more into PC gaming and was very impressed. I also love how fast the computer powers up: it only takes about 11 seconds to get to the login screen and less than 20 to get through login to the desktop. One thing that probably helps in this area is the lack of crapware preloaded on the unit. Thanks to Lenovo for keeping the bloatware to a minimum.The battery life is good for general use, but don't plan to do hardcore gaming without plugging in. As one would expect, performance takes a hit when you operate on battery power.Overall, I love this laptop. Aside from the less-than-stellar speakers, it nails it on just about every level: great looks and style, thoughtful design touches, powerful and fast, excellent keyboard and touchpad responsiveness, nice screen, etc. I am really happy with it.",0
this laptop finally become quite enough that i could bear after i remove win10 and install ubuntu. At first it was really annoying,0
Good all-round business/home machine. There is enough speed and power for my usage and it's easy to carry on business trips. I wish it was touch screen but the back-lit keyboard was a bigger priority. I understand what people mean with the soggy touch pad as it gets a bit of getting used to. Lets hope the screen hinge lasts longer than my last ASUS did which crapped out on me at about 18 months - but I was admittedly hard on it.,0
"This product is top of the line; you pay for the base equipment, which is an excellent choice. The upgrades you can perform to make it yours are what I enjoy most.",0
"This thing is fast -- like 5 times faster than its physically identical Intel predecessor. So fast that it divides users into two ages of computing: pre-M1 and post-M1. 8GB of RAM in M1-land goes a lot, lot, further.Secure your seat in the post-M1 era with this $800 entry-ticket (and sell all your pre-M1 junk), because this 2020 model is fully modern, mostly holding up to the M2.",0
"The keyboard has a lovely (and silent!) touch and isn't cramped at all, and the keyboard isn't the only quiet part - the fan is silent.",0
My kids love to be on their chrome books great buy for the money.,0
"Beautiful, high functioning laptop but you cannot see the keys in many light conditions - the surface of the keyboard is gorgeous, however the keys are painted with a light gold color that disappears, making it very DIFFICULT TO SEE the keyboard. The computer was super light, fast and had a nice look/feel. Had to return it and get a EVO from another mfr. Bummer.",0
"Oh wow does it get hot. Like, so hot you can't even touch the keyboard. Not only that but the cpu basically cooks itself, 92°C on a basic game. Its so bad I tried returning it but got no help at all, so...",0
"I wanted a small laptop, something light and easy to carry, but with a real keyboard for writing. This is pretty close to perfect: It's a bit slow, but it's fast enough; it could be thinner, but it's not too fat. It's cheap, and the battery life seems good. In fact, I'd give it five stars if it only had a lit keyboard - you really can't use it in the dark.",0
Have it for about two months and its amazing,0
"Very disappointed because the Windows operating system uses 22G of the 32G storage ""available!"" Then other Microsoft and Dell junk programs eat up another 4G so by the time I added Adobe reader and a few files I am getting a message I am almost out of storage. So don't be fooled like me thinking 32G is plenty of storage!!!!!! Maybe I missed the fine print??? I don't know why they would sell a system with this setup. Just makes the customer unhappy....",0
It works like magic,0
"Great laptop for gaming at friends houses. I can run Halo Infinite 45-50 fps with all graphics settings on high. You will need to have its power plugged in while playing taxing games like halo or call of duty, because this beast will end its battery life.",0
"can't find out how to turn backlight on. also, on my old hp, the number lock button lit up when it was on. this new doesn't do that. very helpful if light was on.",0
Packaging and delivery was excellent. Ability for self-installation was superb. I was able to transition to my Microsoft account and use the Edge browser with relative ease. Ultra-fast Wireless speed is wonderful to experience. Wow!,0
"it does not have a backlit keyboard as it says in the description, the rest good enough for the price",0
It's really quick and powerful and runs any game I've played flawlessly.,0
The speaker grills can easily be dented.,0
"Can only have two large installed games at a time, ""gaming laptop"" but can only handle two, im constantly uninstalling / reinstalling new games... didnt do enough research not worth 1700$ when i got it",0
"I was disappointed to find that the options under 'bookmark manager"" have been changed. It had been on my older chromebook, that a bookmark entry could be chosen and the options included 'cut' and 'paste'. This allowed me to arrange the bookmarks by priority. Now any new entry goes to the end of the list with no way to move it closer to the top of the list. Bad...Bad. Otherwise I like the chromebook.",0
muy recomendable me ha dado un excelente rendimiento para solid works 2017 me gustaria que le agregaran un led para distinguir si esta en mayusculas o minusculas,0

"I'm a laptop gamer, have been for over a decade. I've had Dell's rockin' XPS, I've had their less-than-satisfactory Alienware and when I needed a new laptop 6 years ago, I went with an MSI, due to the power at an incredible price. Think about that-- 6 years with the same gaming laptop. Ever since then, I've talked my daughter, her boyfriend, 3 of her friends, and two of my nephews into buying MSI and they all love them. I will never buy anything else. Now, to this review-- After 6 years, I needed a new gaming laptop so I bought this. Raytracing? Wasn't any hesitation. And it runs flawlessly! I'm running all of my games in Ultra mode and still getting a steady 60+ FPS. Here's a response to what other people have written:- Laptop is loud-- of course it's loud. That's because of the power inside. You're cramming the 3rd fastest video card on the market into an itty bitty chassis. So if you're complaining that it's loud, you simply don't get it. It's normal.- Low battery life-- It feels like the words ""desktop replacement"" have vanished from the PC gamer vernacular. It's not meant to run on battery. The battery is for if you suddenly have to move it, you can unplug it , move it, and plug it back in. Power goes out? Use the battery to sae your work, then turn it off. That's the whole idea.- The screen and video card are nothing short of amazing. 144mhz? Best screen I've ever used. No jaggies, no pauses, no split-screens. And the RTX card? MSI is one of the few companies that allows you to use the reference drivers directly from NVIDIA, and it's this reason that their laptops withstand the test of time. You get every update from nVidia, roughly one a week. New game comes out, nVidia writes it into their driver, you get it delivered to you. This is the main feature of the system. In contrast, Dell forces you to use their driver and rarely update it. Basically, the Alienware I bought was close to useless in less than a year.- Loud- yeah well, RTX card, lotsa fans running = loud.- heavy-- You're insane. This is one of the lightest gaming pc's on the market.- Sound-- okay, this one is legitimate. The sound is terrible, very tinny. But once I put my headset on, it sounds fantastic. So just figure on using headphones, which you're probably doing anyway to take advantage of spacial sound.- Space - yep, you're gonna need to get a second drive. So, people complain that the 512 gig ssd isn't enough to install a lot of games and they're right, but it's because they don't get it. The SSD should really be just for your OS and any read-write heavy apps. You'll need a second drive, probably a sshd or hdd and MSI, realizing this, has given us a second bay to install one. So quit whining.As you can see, I love my MSI and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Get one NOW.",0
👍,0
Bought for our middle school aged son. Great for him and his use. Looks new and seems to be working great so far.,0
MSI sure does have a lot of programs to accompany your machine.,0
very fast,0
it is a very powerful laptop that is also quite light for how powerful it is.,0
Love it! Great for the price.,0
"I am very happy with this purchase. I will say I first saw them at Best Buy and probably should have gotten it there so I could get some help with a quick start - but, as always, Amazon was $20 less expensive and it was on my doorstep in 2 days. I am figuring it out!",0
I realized this machine gets super hot when playing games,0
"I really enjoy this laptop, It's super quick. Loads into windows under 4 seconds.I added a ""Kingston Technology HyperX Impact 8GB 2666MHz DDR4 CL15 260-Pin SODIMM Laptop Memory (HX426S15IB2/8)"" ram module for making the Ram 16GB total, this will work best with the shared GPU memory.YOU WILL NEED MORE RAM FOR HEAVIER GAMESThe onboard GPU memory is shared with your ram when in gaming mode.I played space engineers, which requires around 5GB of VRAM for medium gameplay, it leaked into my actual ram, but with the hyperx upgrade there was only slight FPS drops but not enough to affect gameplay. Ram is important.I recommend windows 10 Pro 1909, don't use 2004 on this laptop will die really quick in Win 10 2004. Lasted about 3 hours under full load, whist 1909 lasted around 7 hours under full load, close to expected battery life.The Intel CPU Turbos to 3.98 Ghz while plugged in, if you set it that way.If you plan to install linux, the NVME will not be detected at boot time, to fix this, head to bios and on the first tab or second tab press ""CTRL"" + ""S"" to bring up a setting and change and disable intel optane firmware to use nvme in linux, as when you boot a non windows OS, the nvme will be placed into sleep mode.As for a extra nvme slot, i picked up ""Western Digital 250GB WD Blue SN550 NVMe Internal SSD - Gen3 x4 PCIe 8Gb/s, M.2 2280, 3D NAND, Up to 2,400 MB/s - WDS250G2B0C"" from many other users, as this will take full advantage of the laptops firmware and hardware. You can pick higher space storage, but as a light gamer, this was enough for me.As for the 2.5"" drive, i picked up a ""ST1000LM024 HN-m101Mbb"" It's a 1TB Mechanical Drive with decent write and read speeds for lighter games, and game storage. Granted it is slower, but for this laptop its perfect and I can get full R/W speeds that were advertised. If you notice, it's the same drive inside the XBox 1 - 1st Gen, so You can game on it as well, not as fast load times, but its fast enough to still enjoy a game.Besides the battery life, this is a really good laptop if you go out to a friends house for a night and do some moderate gaming like a LAN party, or a small road trip, or sitting out side for a few hours.I do not recommend taking this on a flight. Unless you get an extra battery.As of this message, I am using this as my main pc, and quite enjoy it, the Intel i5v9 is great and the GTX 1650 plays most games on Medium/High at 50/60fps.Also another note to stay on 1909, is that windows f--ked up the NVIDIA auto select method for Intel Graphics and GPU graphics, so some games will default to intel CPU instead of NVIDIA.Also, This laptop can play COD: Cold War at High settings with 48/55fps under heavy scenes and a perfect 60fps on normal fighting.",0
I like this acer chrome book it came on time nice chrome book good sercive thank you,0
"Love it! I use it for school, Netflix, and web surfing. Only things I would change: camera quality isn't terrible but could be better; speakers are on the bottom of the laptop so if I want good sound quality I have to elevate it",0
Tiene de esos monitores que distorsionan los colores dependiendo el ángulo de vision y aun viendo de frente.,0
"Es una buena laptop calidad-precio, lo unico es que la version de i3 no es touch y de preferencia, agreguenle 4 Gb de ram mas",0
Very easy to set up,0
Item matched the description.,0
"This laptop is by no means the greatest gaming laptop out there, but for its price, it's perfect! Runs smoothly, does not over heat and the fan is decently quiet. Has downloaded and run all my games perfectly so far. Wifi card also works really well.",0
Mouse is suspect but everything else is great. Heavy and clunky.,0
The Speaker sound quality is REALLY bad.,0
"My daughter uses this all the time, daily. Loves this. Works great for playing Roblox & for all of her needs. Absolutely a great buy!",0
"I can't believe this touchpad went out. For the price I got it, it's not worth dealing with customer service to get this fixed as I need it for work. Guess I'll just get a mouse. Can easily add in RAM and another 2.5"" ssd while swapping out NVMe if you so desired. Does it's job just C'mon TOUCHPAD!",0
"Love this computer for school. It was an adjustment at first from originally using an HP flagship lap top. Great quality and durable for many office, work, or student capabilities.",0
I just wanted a small PC to do some simple tasks that need to be run on a PC only. Fits the bills really well. Can’t imagine it had any horse power to do anything heavy graphics duty wise. But that wasn’t the purpose of buying this laptop.,0
The only thing I mildly dislike is the battery life. It could probably last longer. I should also say that I use it in the high performance mode which drains the battery faster.This computer has been perfect for my needs (hobby gamer) at a price that won’t break the bank. Five stars all day.,0
Everything they’re not even refund my money back,0
The eMMC storage is freaking slow.,0
My son loves it and it has well balanced specs from AMD 8 cores and 16 GB RAM and good IPS with bright above 300 nits bright screen. Reasonable price and solid the case. Nothing to complain about. Price is good compare to others,0
The keyboard felt good to type on.,0
"El pc es Increíble nos encanto cumple con las expectativas par el trabajo que se compro, lo MALO es que queremos comprar otro portátil y ahora no nos deja hacer la compra por que dice que no se puede enviar a esta misma ubicación! ayúdenos a resolver esto por que queremos comprar otro igual",0
"Very Light Laptop, Nice Clear Bright Screen. Its an awesome Fast laptop.",0
First MacBook and I am in love! I have been using my computer for two days and still have 60% battery life. Very impressive because I have been using it a lot. I’m still getting use to the different feel on how to use it but it really is self explanatory once you start using it.,0
muy buena,0
I bought this for my grand daughter for Christmas and she loves it however the ad listed it a a touch screen and it is not.,0
The Acer nitro 5 is an amazing laptop for gaming and game creation. I’ve had the laptop for two week now and I use it every day for designing and creating my games and graphics designs on photoshop. The battery is around 7-8 hours unless u are us muti tab and you may want to increase your ram but otherwise it works perfectly. I would recommend this laptop to any new and inspiring graphic design artist our game creators as an entry laptop.,0
This laptop is amazing and well worth the buy. Its great for everything from casual everyday stuff to high end gaming.,0
"I bought this laptop for my wife for Christmas. She runs a small business, a sole proprietorship. She does artwork, so she does need some decent computing in addition to email and social media type activities. The laptop has a nice sized screen; it is constructed well (which is important because she's rough on equipment), and is a great value for the money.",0
This is the second intel Aspir 5 I have had to return new out of the box becouse it would not do a clean reload wioit a blue screenThe AMD version is Awsume,0
Very nice laptop! Great value!,0
"I absolutely love this laptop. I'm a software engineer and as you can imagine I spend a lot of time of the computer. This computer is lightning fast, a dream to type on, and it has a beautiful screen. The only downside is that camera quality, which is absolutely atrocious. I have a desktop PC that I do my web conferencing over anyways, so it's not big deal for me. If you really care about the webcam, I would suggest purchasing a third-party webcam. Other than that, I highly recommend this product and I could not be more pleased with it.",0
"As per what I've come to expect with Dell hardware, it comes installed with quite a few things I don't really need, however, it definitely does its job for gaming and is decently comfortable for typing as long as you have a laptop desk to protect your lap or use it on a desk.The orange backlit keyboard is pretty nice for typing (using it to type this review right now) and doesn't feel super mushy like some laptop membrane keyboard, though I'm not yet sure if that'll hold up to long-term hardcore gaming, so even if you're playing at LAN parties elsewhere, I'd probably bring a dedicated keyboard (and of course a mouse) and that brings me to the peripherals.Basically, this has enough USB ports for a mouse and keyboard and 2 spare ports for other items, or if you happen to use one of the wireless keyboard/mouse combos that use 1 dongle, you'd have 3 available. As well, it does have a standard headphone/mic jack for gaming headset needs along with an ethernet port, and it only has 1 HDMI or you have to use 1 of the USB ports as well for another monitor. I'd say if you're going to use this as your main gaming machine, it would probably be best to invest in a USB dock that can help you solve your port problem, though you'll have to check those specs on them especially since not all of them support high refresh rate gaming, so watch out for that.Another thing that this does well with is sound quality. I won't say it's super amazing, but you won't be disappointed with the experience, though you'll definitely want a headset when you're not at home with this.I will also say that this thing gets HOT. Even when it's only using the onboard graphics this thing can kick out heat so be careful when letting it sleep as sometimes it doesn't completely sleep and can get quite hot, so make sure it's well vented when plugged in so you don't have any hot surprises! The brick also cooks as well at times so be careful of that.Overall, it's a decent gaming laptop, though I'd say it's better as a mobile gaming machine over your main machine, but I'm blessed enough to have a gaming PC that outclasses this laptop but is a royal pain to travel with over this.",0
Wish it had another thunderbolt 3 port,0
Wonderful and easy to use.,0
"Super slow, volume is too low - please don’t waste your money. Got it recently and planning to return",0
I know this is a gaming laptop but I actually bought it for school and it might sounds overkill but this laptop is perfect for schoo,0
It's ok for looking up stuff and doing light work but will not do Windows,0
Best ultrabook,0
Es liviana y facil de manejar.,0
"I would call this a notebook as opposed to a laptop because it is small, but I needed a backup. I'm not a techie, but it seems pretty speedy for the size, and works perfectly for the basic things I need it for - internet and working with MS Word. I consider this more a casual, light use pc rather than something to run several big programs/applications or for gaming.",0
"The plug has bright blue light that never goes off. It is nice to be able to find the plug, but it never shuts off and it is so bright, not something I would want to keep in my bedroom. It is a mild annoyance.",0
"Only problem, mine has a hard smell like mechanics, what should I do? Is this normal? I can smell it in the entire room?",0
"Purchased it, modified it and now it's worth the money.",0
This laptop is exactly as described in the description. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.,0
My son is very happy with his purchase (he saved for a long time!). He is using it for gaming and to learn programming.,0
"Do not get this laptop if you wish to replace a typical desktop computer and use it with dual external monitors. Especially via the USB C port. I am constantly dealing with the computer entirely freezing up and losing HDMI signal. This occurs when doing absolutely nothing CPU/GPU intensive. Simply opening a Netflix tab will kill the monitor signal and the entire computer will become unresponsive for many minutes at a time, often requiring a hard restart.Laptop is nice and portable and works (seemingly) fine with one monitor directly via its HDMI port. But as soon as there is an attempt to extend the display and use both the HDMI and USB C for dual monitor setup (regardless of resolution), it becomes an absolute nightmare.",0
For the price and it apple product. I expected much more. Not able to download certain apps due to the small storage space on the laptop. Have to purchase an extra adapter for additional USB ports.,0
"I used this laptop for 6 months and when I purchased it, on paper it looked amazing.i7-10th gen U processor (I would have rather had an H series processor but couldn't find a laptop I liked.1 tb ssdgtx 16504k ips rgb displayBut read the reviews.. when I bought mine, there were not many reviews listed anywhere.my laptop started to freeze after about the 100 day mark, at about the 140 day mark, I closed the lid and the cheap plastic hinge snapped. the computer is basically cheap plastic so keep that in mind. 2 small plastic hinges is all that's keeping the computer together.Battery life is fair and what you would expect.The cooling fand run all the time which is a bit annoying but again, didn't know that when I bought it.I used this for video content creation and photos hop and there was a noticeable lag when creating videos especially 4k 60fps videos. rendering and exporting took a considerable amount of time( 8 hours)Avoid this brand and especially this model.",0

"--almost 3 weeks usage--Great for Work / Mail / Internet ""stuff"" / Study tasks.Fast boot, bright image.Strong build. I didn't like the Camera.The sound is excellent, very good speakers (but nobody uses them..)Keyboard is ok, Track pad ok too.I've not tried playing games.. I have no opinion about it..It has 4 cores and 8 threads.. really wasn't expecting that..I should have read the specifications first..I use Hangout and Skype a lot, If camera was better I'd give five stars",0
"Samsung does not honor their warranty. The right outer hinge stopped working, so when I lifted the lid the screen cracked. I called Samsung and they had me send the device in. I received a call about a week later, they claimed that there had been water damage and would not repair. I don't remember spilling any water on the device, and what would that have to do with a frozen hinge?I will not be buying anymore Samsung products.",0

Me agrado todo el funcionamiento de la computadora,0
"I wanted to love this laptop, but it makes a constant, high pitched, whining noise when the cooling fans are running. This seems to be a known issue and a flaw of the overall physical design of the fans/ventilation. If you search Acer's forums, or Reddit, you will notice other users reporting the same problem.If you're the type of gamer that is always playing with a headset, or the volume up, then the whining noise will be drowned out. Otherwise, its _very_ noticeable.",0
I would have liked the external speakers to be louder,0

Bought this laptop for a friend who goes to college. Upon using it for a couple weeks they said they liked it and it was super fast. They had no issues or hiccups since then. Laptop is great for simple work like homework browsing the web checking emails. I wouldn't recommend this laptop for any type of heavy gaming. All in all this laptop is great for everyday light use.,0
The Best!,0
"First hour out of the box. There’s a very cheap feeling and sounding rattle of the aluminum chassis when I type. It’s so loud, it’s possible I’ll get used to it though. And sadly my feeling of this laptop being ‘cheap’ was corroborated by an arrow key coming off the first time I touched it :( the specs are great, and it’s a gorgeous laptop. But damn this feels crappily made.",0
It was as described.,0
This laptop works perfectly.,0
The battery life is decent and the unit charges quickly with the monster 180W power brick it shipped with.,0
it works ok never got warranty,0

"I bought this 2 months ago and so far, it holds up pretty well. The browser is a little slow, but what do you expect from a laptop that costs less than $200? I purchased this to replace an ASUS Chromebook that I had purchased in 2016 that completely broke down for no discernible reason- I'm sure I can expect the same from this one in the next 5 years, but at least it doesn't have a touch screen that'll stop responding 5 months in. Works perfectly fine for all things web based- streaming on platform websites (not apps), Facebook, email, neopets. Not many Playstore apps are compatible with chromebooks and those that are are excessively slow. Again, the browser is a little slow, but nothing unbearable. Would definitely not recommend for any type of gaming- I can't even get roll20 to work so I can't imagine any other website with a heavier load would work.",0
"Needed a gaming laptop, I previously had a Acer Predator which was only 15.6"". I wanted a 17 because I game a lot but I also travel a lot so I don't always have access to an external monitor.There's nothing I've thrown at it that it doesn't run smoothly at max or almost max settings. I also appreciate the minimalist design. It doesn't have 5 million stickers on it. One wouldn't be able to tell its for gaming at allAs expected from gaming laptops the battery life is quite bad.I also purchased an additional SSD for extra storage and found the installation simple.It does get quite loud though but that's also to be expected, but I game with a headset so it doesn't bother me",0
Battery does not stay charged. I only use it plugged in because it only lasts about 1.5 hours while not gaming. The battery % goes down while gaming even when plugged in. I shut it down with 100% battery and turn it on the next nothing morning and it's below 50% battery. I contacted Asus and they tried telling me this is normal... Meanwhile the battery is internal and only lasts so many charges. The i7 and 1060gtx is also always in the red high heat zone. Regretting buying an Asus RoG Strix. Pick a different gaming laptop.,0
"This computer is a great value for home use or school. It has a great screen, though not touchscreen, and some nice features like built-in Alexa and plenty of ports like usb-c. The set-up was super easy as the computer talkst th to you through the entire setup. It comes with Windows 10 personal and a trial of office, so more of a computer for online apps. It boots quickly, nice and quiet, and runs nicely. The keyboard just feels a bit cheap and doesn’t illuminate.",0
"full charged battery just last a couple of hours. I have to plug in while working, but the charger gets super hot itself!with 100% volume, I can't hear it very well. No I don't have hearing problem.",0
"Excellent computer, came as advertised. Fast and lightweight, it's great for work or school. My screen had 2 dead pixels though",0
I have been using this Chromebook for awhile now and I like the simplicity of it. The battery life is good but if you don't turn it off and let it go to sleep the battery will drain within days even when you don't use it. Now I just turn it off when I don't use it. Overall it's great to use around the house and to have a device with a keyboard if you don't want to use a laptop. The audio quality is okay I think my 2017 iPad pro sounds way better,0
Easy to use. Wanted a new laptop and I made a good choice.,0
While I have only used for 2 hours. It has been smooth sailing during set up. I did not have to do any manual back door work around. Things funtioned well. I wondered if a lighted keyboard was a bunch of not need feature. Nowafter 2 hours not sure I would ever be without one. While I can type my figures often use the backup key for correction. The lighted keyboard makes that easy. I have noticed a great the case is built. Only about quarter inch on each side of screen so it almost feels like a 15.6 computer but with a bigger screen. Display has great color.I like the power chord hook up out the back verse always having a chord hanging on the side you have to be careful to not bump.The feature I rank the best is the fact that the screen is approximately a full inch over the keyboard. Meaning you are not looking at your fingers but at the screen while your typing. Something I always found annoying comparedto desktops.The keyboard has a nice touch. While it is not ultra thin like some I also don't feel like I am going to break it because it is brittle.This computer is fast that means heat when you give it a challenge. There is lots of good case venilation. Overall after 2 hours I am very please with my purchase. I am not a gamer but who knows maybe I will be if Covid continues.,0
"I decided to buy myself a gaming laptop and for the price, this one can not be beaten. The price is reasonable while being a very sturdy machine. Most games run on ultra or high setting. The only downside was the storage space but for an extra 70 bucks, you can expand it so not an issue at all.",0
Sent this is for a second time. For repair,0
This is my second MSI. I have had NO problems ever with ithis brand computer.,0
The need for an anti-theft system for windows with motion detection technology in this device is a critical security feature that cannot be overlooked.,1

"This budget laptop features Windows 11, and a nice display. It is a familiar wedge shape, and weight is moderate. The top part is made of aluminum for stiffness, the bottom part is plastic. The nice, bright 1080p display has thin borders on two side to give the laptop a clean, modern look. There are plenty of ports, including USB-A and USB-C, plus HDMI and ethernet. Sound quality is decent for watching streaming videos - good at reproducing voices. The trackpad is a nice size and the keyboard has a good enough feel for typing.The laptop is easy to upgrade. There is one free memory slot, and space for a second 2.5 inch hard drive or SSD. Screws for mounting the drive are included. The laptop ships with 4 GB of ram, and a small 128GB SSD. Adding an additional 8GB of ram, and a second drive are inexpensive upgrades well worth doing. I commend Acer for making it simple to upgrade, as this is not always the case with laptops.Performance is fine for day-to-day tasks. Web pages load fairly quickly, and streaming media plays smoothly. Setup is easy to do, but be prepared to wait for a while for it to complete. Overall, this is a nice, inexpensive entry level laptop that should work well for those who need a basic laptop for web surfing, word processing and watching streaming media. I’m pleased with it.",0
"The Victus lineup consists of HP’s entry level gaming laptops. There are currently two Victus models: the Victus 16 (released May 2021) and the Victus 15 (released June 2022). The 15 and 16 in the model’s name is the screen size, in inches (rounded).I’ll start with the specifications, since the listed specs are incomplete:1. Display: 1080p @ 144Hz FHD IPS LED display. It does not support using HDR (although you can play HDR video).2. CPU/APU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800H (Zen 3; pcie gen 3).3. RAM: Two slots, two sticks of 8GB RAM (16 GB total), running in dual channel, at 3200 Mhz (primary timings 22 - 22 - 22 – 52, @ 1.2v).4. GPU: OEM for HP, Nvidia 3050ti (1222hz base, 1485 boost clock). Bus width registering as only 128 bits. By default, the GPU is automatically disabled to save the battery when not needed and it switches over to internal AMD graphics. The GPU reads as pcie 4.0 x8 (this is the same as pcie 3.0 x16). However, the Ryzen 7 5800H supports up to gen 3, so I suspect this is an error and is actually pcie 3.0 x 16 (which is the same bandwidth).5. SSD: one M2 slot available, filled by a 512 GB M2 NVME 1.3, PCIE 3.0 x 4, SSD by Sk Hynix OEM for HP. There is no second SSD connector for a storage drive. This runs and registers as gen 3, so there’s no benefit to upgrading to a gen 4 SSD.6. Chipset: Registers as “AMD Promontory / Bixby Fusion Controller Hub” – so obviously not helpful since that is a very board catchall category spanning several years and three or four generations of chipsets. I would note here that current gen AMD APUs are based on the newer Zen 3+ architecture; so the 5800H used here is last year’s model.7. Warranty: 1 year.Upgradeability (see pictures).Opening it up - the bottom cover is removable. You’ll need a plastic removal tool (there are about 50 snap connect joints around the edges). There’s no anchor points from the keyboard, which is a plus.No additional RAM slots - Inside, there are two RAM slots (both filled). If you upgrade, you’d need to remove both sticks and cycle to 2 x 16 GB sticks. There is no functional or other reason I can think of why 2 x 16 GB wouldn’t be supported as an upgrade (even though it is not a configuration offered by HP). I don’t know if 2 x 32GB would be supported.No second SSD slot – There is one 2280 (standard size) M2 M Keyed-SSD slot (also filled). The PCB has a printed space for a second M2 form factor SSD; however, it is disabled. Even if the second M2 slot were modified (i.e., you’d need to buy and solder an NGFF M2 M connector and remove the motherboard to add a standoff) it’s not readily apparent if the 4 pcie lanes printed on the board are electrically powered and run to the CPU. The working SSD slot is a standard M2 2280 M key slot so your only options for more space are to upgrade the boot drive, or use an external enclosure.Vents - There are two heatsink pipes running in tandem. They appear to be graphite coated copper. The pipes run from the GPU, to the CPU, to side-by-side internal case fans, which sit on the heatsink. The fans pull air from the back vents of the PC. Although the vents run the length of the laptop, only 50% of the vents have slots. The remaining half looks like a vent but it’s solid plastic. After passing the heatsink, the hot air exhausts underneath the laptop so it might help to raise the laptop to improve thermals. Although the bottom of the laptop looks like half the base is an air vent, that is not the case. All the air vents are blocked off except for two circles cut out where the two fans are located. This is typical to direct airflow in a certain direction.BIOs – The Bios chip is easily accessible, but soldered. It is on the smaller end at 16MB. It’s a standard Winbond 25 series SPI flash so it could be copied and backed up manually and swapped with the backup chip in the event of unrecoverable failure.Wifi card – MediaTek MT7921 card; Bluetooth 5.2, Wifi 6, also easily accessible.Stress Tests:The SSD gets read speeds of 3600 MB/s during my testing, which is very good considering this is pcie gen 3 (the theoretical max is 4000 MB/s). For real world usage, I would consider anything above 3200 MB/s very good.Under high video load (and low CPU load) the temps level out around 67*C, with hotspots jumping to the mid-70s. Under load, the laptop is pulling around 70W, of which about 47.4 are fueling the Nvidia chip. This pulls around 70W (47.4W coming just from the GPU chip). The dual fans, while noticeable on full blast, are not overly loud or distracting. Keep in mind these figures are consumption by the components, so wattage at the wall outlet would be a bit higher due to efficiency losses.The laptop uses a 200W AC adapter with an HP-specific connector that is used across several HP laptop brands. However, the 200W rating for the AC adapter is really high (compared to non-gaming laptops) so I’d be careful using a generic AC adapter or HP adapter designed for another laptop without checking the power ratings.Cons:SSD - I think the biggest downside is SSD upgradeability. The boot drive is only offered in up to 1 TB capacity, which for gaming use, could easily be used up with several large titles. While the boot drive capacity wouldn’t normally be a problem, the problem here is there is no option or physical ability to add a second internal storage drive. This laptop is limited to one SSD. Although there’s a second SSD slot printed on the motherboard, that has been physically (and possibly electrically) incapacitated and is rendered unusable by the manufacturer (see above comments). I have already ordered a 2TB NVME PCiE SSD to replace the 512GB boot drive, but I think it is unrealistic not to allow an option to add a storage drive on a gaming laptop.APU/CPU – This laptop was just released in June 2022, so I don’t know why they are using the Ryzen 7 5800H, which is a Zen 3 APU released in January 2021. The successor, the Ryzen 7 6800H, was released in January 2022, so I would think the newest gaming model to join the Victus lineup should be based on the the Zen 3+ APUs, not last year’s model.USB/c – There is only 1 USB/C port. Although it supports video and power delivery, it is only capable of 5 Gbps (so USB 3.0, aka 3.1 gen 1). I would expect at a minimum a USB 3.1 gen 2 (10 Gbps) port, which is pretty much the standard on laptops and PCs these days. Better yet would be a Thunderbolt 3 or 4 port (standard for business laptops, less common for gaming). This is probably the reason I have to run my second 4K monitor at only 30Hz. Note that the USB/C port will not charge the laptop, or if so, it might require a power adapter capable of supplying closer to 200W than what I tested it with. Other HP laptops with USB/c pd capable ports can be used to charge the laptop in lieu of the adapter, but that is not the case here.My Impression:I think this is an excellent compromise on performance versus price for an entry level gaming laptop. During my use, I did not encounter any glitches, stuttering, BSODs or other critical events. For 1080p gaming at 144hz (the max resolution of the laptop monitor), the 3050ti, Ryzen 7, and NVME PCiE SSD are all you really need for most titles. The physical design is good, and the plastic laptop case is about as sturdy as any other laptop in its class and price range. If you upgrade the boot drive shortly after purchase, I’d probably recommend starting with a clean install because there is a lot of unnecessary bloatware (which is typical for an OEM). The windows license is digitally registered to your PC (based on the UUID, MAC and serial saved to BIOS) so you can always wipe and start clean.I am normally used to seeing two metal hinges on a laptop to hold up the monitor, so the integrated plastic folding design over a single metal pole used here is different to me. The airflow is pretty good with the dual case fans and dual graphite coated copper pipes (keep it raised). The mouse/touchpad is very bigThis laptop would also be great to dual for work use, and the design (unlike the flashy Alienware series) is fine for business and personal use. I’m also able to power two work monitors @ 4K via a dock with this laptop, without issue.",0
"We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our 11 year old daughter. So far it's working great, and she just started being homeschooled and it's working out wonderfully for school work. One complaint ...the charging cord barely stays in the port and the slightest movement will cause the cord to not be charging the computer anymore. It's very very annoying. To think you are charging the chrome book and find out it hasn't charged at all because the cord shifted. The cord doesn't lock in at all. It feels like it barely stays in.",0
I am very happy with this purchase. I love the touchscreen,0
It’s perfect and fast shipping,0

"Where to begin. I have been using this laptop for about 7 months and I think it is worth of every penny spend on it and even more. I use my laptop daily, I work on it, do web searching, watch shows, but I mostly use it for gaming which is what this bad boy does best. I'm gonna divide my opinion on positives and negatives and then give a final conclusion.-Positives- -The 7th gen intel core and Rtx 2070 work amazing specially for heavy games, providing nice and flowing fps, I run big games like Battlefield, GTA, The Witcher, othes ehich require CPU like World of Warcraft, etc, and it has never let me down.-I really like how vivid colors are compared to other gaming laptops out there, most people won't notice or won't care but if you are one of those persons who like to watch TV shows on good quality screens or enjoy video games at it's best definitely this screen.-Thin screen, I love this; gives the laptop a modern, fresh looking appearance, some laptops look really bulky precisely because there is 1 inch of nothing on each side, making the laptop looking like a monitor from the 90's.-Nice looking keyboard, has many different combinations of colors and styles, I personally turn it down because I have always prefered nothing really, but it really helps if you need to type in a dark place. The keyboard is small but you will definitely get use to it (I hated laptop keyboards because how small they were, but now I love it)-Negatives--I don't like were the usb ports are located, I think a better job could've been done.-I'm not really sure about this one but it kinda gets a little bit hot like a gaming laptops because there is not enough room for ventilation, therefore it's a bit noisy. However this could be fixed with a pair of headphones and putting something under the laptop to raise so it disipates heat.-Short battery life like 90 min on maximum performance or approximately 170min on battery saver, again this is a gaming laptop they have a short battery life, I keep mine plugged in during gaming and havy stuff so it is not really a problem for me, I knew my needs from the beginning.In conclusion if you are the type of person who cares more about performance than anything else this is an extremely good option, if you don't bother about battery life and can still work with 2 h 30 min at savings it might work for you. Again this laptop was designed for heavy stuff and to offer an extraordinary performance for the users eho value it. If you need a quite, not designed for gaming or heavy programs computter get a mac.",0
the battery life is somewhat poor even during normal work,0

"I purchased this laptop around April 2020. Within less than a year, the GPU fan started to act up. It would stop spinning and my laptop will start to overheat like crazy. I went to several stores to see what's the issue with the GPU fan, and they told me that I would've to replace the fan. It's crazy how a fan is broken in less than a year. I would highly recommend avoiding getting predator helios 300 laptop to avoid future malfunction.",0

"I was in the market for a laptop, as I felt it was time for an upgrade. Being a retired IT professional, I needed a laptop where I can use my 4K drone footage for video editing...and do some gaming as well. I knew what specs I wanted and what I was willing to pay...even if there was a trade off between specs and affordability.I also read and watched umpteen rated reviews and based on those reviews and while there are MANY gaming laptops out there, I decided on purchasing the Acer Predator Helios 300.The specs on this bad boy are excellent and fitted my requirements, everything works as it should, meaning that I have no issues with performance with hardware or software.Below are, in my opinion, pros and cons of this laptop -PROS -Price - $1183.00 (at the time of purchase) Value for money!!CPU speed is lightening - i7 Octa-core Intel ProcessorWindows 10 - Free upgrade to Windows 11Dedicated GPU - nVidia GeForce RTX 3060RAM - 16gigs DDR4HD - 512GB SSDBattery - 58WattsBuild Quality - Alluminum cover and keyboard chassis - ExcellentWiFi capability - IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/axLAN - Gigabit EthernetBluetooth 5.1Webcam - 720PPorts - USB Type-C port: USB 3.2 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps), DisplayPort over USB-C, Thunderbolt 4, USB charging 5 V; 3 AScreen - 15.6"" FHDRefresh Rate - 144HzUpgradeable - Extra 1 SSD & 1 HD slot availableRBG Keyboard with 4 zone lightingPredator Sense Software is greatTurbo Boost ButtonNumber Pad at the sideAlexa built-inCONS -Weight - 5.1 LBSFingerprint Reader - NoSD Card Reader - NoTouchscreen - NoBuild - Bottom of laptop has a plastic coverSome BloatwareMost importantly - Battery Life - Horrendous (I got about 2 hrs with light computing)Like I stated, I was willing to make compromises/trade offs on what was important to me in purchasing this laptop. I knew that I needed/wanted a fast CPU and a dedicated GPU, with at least 16gigs of RAM, great quality build with a decent enough gamut range for my video/gaming requirements.My trade off are with the battery life and SD Card Reader. Most gaming laptops are NOT noted for good battery life, as the power that's required to push the CPU, GPU and the screen's refresh rate, well, the battery is going to suffer. With that in mind, I knew that portability wasn't going to be an issue, as I would rearly use the laptop on battery power....as the laptop will be connected to the power supply (230W AC power adapter), so that really didn't impact my decision. For the SD Card reader, well, that did, as my drone uses a Micro SD card, but since there's the Thunderbolt 4 port that comes with the laptop, I would just purchase a card reader and connect it to the port and that too would be solved.Overall, this laptop is powerful, the specs proves that, but again...everyone's requirements are different from person to person, so do your research and make a decision that suits YOUR NEEDS as this suited mine.Hope this information helps and thanks for reading my review.Note - Now I have to find a way to get the Acer Predator Helios 300 away from my daughter...lol...she's the REAL gamer in the family.",0
So far the battery life seems way too short. Maybe I have to tweek some settings or contact customer support.,0
"Every time I pick it up I'm in fear it'll fold in half under it's own weight, like a soggy pancake.",0
"Bought this strictly for gaming away from home. It does the job, although higher-end games cause it to get really hot... to the point I decided to get a voltage throttler and slow down the CPU to keep it cooler.Other than that one issue, it's been a great little laptop.",0
"AMD's integrated graphics are also surprisingly good, especially considering that you get it for free from the processor.",0
The quality of this laptop is too poor. the screen is flashing all the time.,0
I called tech support for ASUS and they could not help.,0
"This machine is amazing! Really fast, works very well for gaming as well as day-to-day tasks! Only downturn is the keyboard, it really stinks! REALLY, big time, if you are used to good keyboards, I would not recommend this computer. If you can move past that, then this laptop is for you. It doesn't bother me that much since I use a second screen with a USB-HUB for a mechanical keyboard, but could be annoying for some people.Besides that, I would also recommend upgrading the RAM to 16 gb minimum as well as getting a SSD to mount in this machine, it really bring a great machine to become fenomenal!",0
"We purchased these for remote school. They pretty regularly fail to recognize headphones or have their internal mics fail. Rebooting usually fixes this, but with a managed Chromebook, the login process is really arduous.Don't recommend.",0
So far it’s been 40 days since my laptop is being repaired for a failure that was caused for a Bios update that I didnt ask for in a brand new #HP Spectre. 40 days studing and trying to do my work from my #Iphone6s .Hardware Updates are extremely dangerous and Premium support is absolutely the worst.,0

M1 chip is faster than core i5. I see there is quite a big difference in machine handling concurrent applications at a time. Really nice improvement by Apple.,0

"I've dabbled in desktop PC gaming for years now, but this is my first proper gaming laptop. I searched around for a while for something I wanted in my price range and after all the research and reviews, settled on this MSI machine. It's been very good to me in my first month of use. Here's my own quick list of good and bad - I'll look to update this six months in or sooner if any issues arise (hopefully not of course).Good-The RTX2070 card is great for the gaming I've been doing, runs everything I've tried so far at high settings and I should be set for a few years at least.-Same for the 10th gen Intel CPU - great processor for the price-The 144 hz monitor looks great (I'm no expert in these things, but to my untrained eye, it's stellar)-Temps have been OKAY so far, not great, but far from crazy hot (a little tweaking here goes a long way). Which is all I need from a laptop with these kinds of parts inside it-The light up RGB keyboard is quite nice to look at, and can be customized with different colors, etc.-Plenty of ports, including HDMI out, mini-display and USB-C-Build quality itself seems solid/sturdy enough so farNot so good-Speakers are....not great. I wasn't expecting top of the line sound or anything, and it's....fine? I would recommend headphones if sound quality is important to you though.-It is a fingerprint MAGNET. I've never had a machine pick up my prints like this one does.-Battery life is as bad as you've read elsewhere. It doesn't bother me, though, because it's pretty much what I expected to get from a gaming-centric laptop. If you're planning on using it on the go a lot, you might want to consider something else.Overall, it's been worth the buy for me and I'd easily recommend this machine to anyone else in the market for a gaming laptop in this price range.",0
"La computadora llego antes de la fecha se?alada, en perfectas condiciones.Es para mi hija que esta en secundaria, así que todas las características son optimas.",0
I 've been trying to contact amazon to get a product support but no one answer..the bluetooth is not working at all never connected.. the power point and word keep crashing..major dissapointment,0
Stopped working in less than 2 months and been trying to get a refund contacted seller and amazon customer service more than 6 weeks ago and didn’t hear a word back from them the laptop is just junk,0
A premium built I would say by the touch and feel.,0
"I was a little nervous reading reviews that stated that computers come used, not working etc. I can confirm that Amazon delivered to me a pristine machine - working perfectly, is new and exactly to the spec Amazon advertised. Very happy with the purchase. I purchased UHD+ Touchscreen 10th gen i7 - the screen is perfect, on par or better than new MacBook Pro that I also use. Overall new XPS 15 is well designed, solid machine with fast processor and outstanding UHD+ screen. I also like that I can upgrade it to 64GB or RAM for about $300 (2933MHz DDR4 CL17 SODIMM Laptop Memory).P.S. For non technical people, please run both Dell updater (lots of drivers / bios updates there) and Windows updates.",0
"I have used it for 1 month, my rate is...--pros: good battery life, display(it is touchscreen, but you will barely use it), light for its high performance. beautiful and cool design, speaker at the ends of keyboard.--cons: display is not anti-glare, fan design, material get fingerprint very easily, coil whine.Pros detail: good battery life, but when I tested and compared with LG gram 15'', gram has at least 20% long lasted( no worry, it is still good, just gram is very well designed), many recent laptop has display problem, but this model does not have yellowish or color changing problem. It is pretty hard to get this light weight for this high performance laptop, Design is very cool, it has logo lit on back of display. Also its thin! Location of speaker is another good point, you can hear its direct and vivid sound.Cons detail: When you lower the brightness, you may see yourself of display. I did not noticed anti-glare was a big thing when I bought it. Fan blow on its rear and display blocks it. So monitor gets hotter and it affect your keyboard temperature. Definitely it is not designed for gaming. But keyboard does not become very hot. it can be warm. This model gets fingerprint very easily...but not a big deal.Lets talk about real problem....Coil whine!! For browsing internet, watch movie or other light work, no coil whine or very quite coil whine..you cannot hear it in very quite area until you put your ear on the laptop.For hardwork like gaming: Sometimes very loud and it can be louder than fan noise. But I don't hear it all the time. Usually laptop sound overwhelming it or only sometimes( loading game for a few second, then small coil whine) it has very loud coil whine.Advice: Many recent laptop has coil whine, and I guess you want portable laptop that you can work in school and play game at home...like me. It's good design, good performance, light weight, long battery and you cannot hear coil whine when you work on school( light work)... I like it. I have no regret that I bought this model.",0

"The computer was wonky from the start as the new operating system requires you to use your hotmail or other Microsoft email to login and get the thing going. And from there it’s all down hill. I tried to use Google Chrome which worked better than the windows browser but eventually even that failed. Setting up email on this thing was a nightmare and it really cannot handle office 360. I think the issue is this computer us but made to run Windows 11. This when I went back to reset the computer to factory settings the computer went into an infinity loop of death. The computer is a useless paperweight that uses up electricity and gets warm. It might be a fire hazard. Called customer service x2. Did not get much help. Even when they finally said they’d send out a slip to mail it back to fix it, I never got anything in my email on it or by postal mail. It’s been another month of waiting and now it’s too late to send back to Amazon for a refund. So Acer is all I can deal with. And they are not aces. They are more like something else that starts with an a…. Buyer beware. Doc Jim.",0
"La verdad después de mirar muchos videos y rese?as opté por este equipo, es el que mejor componentes ofrece por un valor asequible. Estoy muy contento con la compra, vale la pena. (Aunque el cargador es un poco pesado, pero ya sabía y la batería en uso normal, word, musica, videos dura solo 2h 40 minutos) pero por todo lo que ofrece al precio que tiene no se puede pedir más. El envío llegó 4 días antes de lo esperado :))))",0
Has preformed up to our expectations,0
The screen looks super nice with brilliant color.,0
I paid a little more for this one to get the faster processor. It was worth it.,0
worked for 48 hours then would no longer power on. do not buy.,0
never used anything that lagged his much ! even the SUPER old andriods loaded faster dont buy this garbage,0
VERY BAD EXPERIENCE. THE LAPTOP SENT NOT TESTED WAS FOR YOU. LAPTOP DOES NOT TURN ON ONLY THE POWER AND CAPS LOCK LIGHTS BLINK. NOBODY GIVES ME SUPPORT NOW I AM ALREADY IN MY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN ECUADOR AND NOW I HAVE TO RUN WITH EXPENSES TO SEND THE EQUIPMENT BACK. VERY BAD.,0
So I received my AeroBook yesterday from a crowd funding campaign.,0
"This item is garbage, my son is a student and the computer won't allow him to go onziom because it has a micro dot and added to it .ad my companies IT look at the computer. They said it is impossible to take it off and go on regular zoom. My son has already missed two zoom, college classes. He used his loan money to get a computer. The reply I got from the company is that it is my problem not there .They are so rude.",0
It’s decent for the low price. Not too slow and can do most of the basic. Gave three stars because it lasted me one year then the screen started flashing with lines to eventually become completely white. Can’t use it anymore.,0
The touchpad is accurate and offers plenty of gestures,0
I ordered 2 of these laptops. both came with the box resealed and invalid windows keys.,0
"It works the first time it was turned on. The laptop is as described on the Amazon website and it has an SD media card reader which is not shown in one of the product pictures. Will update review if anything happens. Updated: Unfortunately, I discovered that the internal microphone is defective; no sound was generated when spoken to with ZOOM. I checked to make sure all configurations were set up correctly, and even reset Windows11, but the mic was not responsive...",0

"Bought this pc with the intent of installing a lightweight linux distro on it. When I received it, I spent 10 min playing around on it and found windows 10 to be slow. After some research, I installed Ubuntu Mate on it and it works like a peach! After installation there was about 20 Gb of free space and all the functions worked (bluetooth, web cam, hdmi port, ect.) . Its a lightweight distro that still carries alot of functions. However, do you research and install at own risk. Might not work/be for everyone.",0
Going from a first generation i7 quad core to a ninth generation hex core has been quite a leap forward and really enjoy the computer.,0
"This laptop will overheat while playing World of Warcraft. I can't figure out why. I have bought and attempted to even use a Nobelbird Cooling Pad to see if this will help with this issue and it does help.I will not advise buying this product for gaming. Have no other issues. While playing for about 20 or so minutes before system shuts down everything is great. So for what I bought this laptop for was gaming this is the reason for my rating.After further investigation on my issue with this laptop I found that the issue was not a overheating issue but thatwhile playing my games I.E. World of Warcraft that after approximately 15 to 20 minutes of playing with the lid closedthis unit would either go into ""Sleep mode or Hibernation"" without any notice. No matter what the settings were forthe lid not doing anything when it was closed & power settings set to never for the shut down for the HD.It was evident that this is what happened cause upon starting back up my game was still running although it wasdisconnected from the servers.Thanks for the support from Amazon they were able to issue a RMA for another unit which arrived today.Other than this issue I found not other issues with this unit and would recommend this product.Another change in RATING:Final review for this piece of dog doo. The original unit that I got was having issue with shutting down while on external display ""Sanyo TV Model FW40D36F"" and with all available power setting for when the lid is closed ""DO NOTHING"". Well Amazon was good enough to do a ""RMA"" on it and now have the replacement unit all set up as theoriginal one ordered and guess what, THE SAME DARN THING IS HAPPENING WITH THIS NEW UNIT. I have searched allover for a answer to this issue but can not find any answers. Of the ones I did see I did what was advised but to noavail.So if you are looking to get a gaming laptop and want to use a larger display like a TV then I DO NOT SUGGEST THISMODEL. I know for a fact that this can be done because this TV was being used by my son on his GIGABYTE laptopwith no issues.There is an area in Windows10 about DisplayHDR capability devices for unites like this one and per Sanyo web site myTV is DisplayHDR capable, but Windows10 is saying NOT.So what am I saying, how can you believe in, Windows, ASUS or Sanyo.I can still play my games ( WoW, Anthem and TC Division2 ) with the lid slightly raised but this defeats the issue.",0
"Esta bien, lo único es que es difícil trabajar en programas de office",0
Good value for the price but the graphics are not the greatest and some apps can be glitchy. The battery life is great and it’s easy to use. The touchscreen works fine.,0
"Everything works quite well except for one issue that is ruining my new laptop, whenever I use the scroll wheel to scroll down it undoes my last action. Quite like an undo button it closes tabs, ends programs, and stops whatever I did last. This is an issue I have never experienced before with no assistance on how to fix it. Honestly, I'm debating returning the laptop simply because it does not work properly.",0
"This is a nice, quick computer with some limitations. It is nice to have the Windows update. The keyboard is of a good design and easy to use. The one thing I should have paid attention to when I bought it was it doesn't have a DVD/CD drive. Other-than-that, my wife and I are really happy with it. Its light weight, compact, easy to use. We bought it during the yearly sale that Amazon has on most of their products. We saved a bundle on this computer. All-in-all, we are very satisfied.",0
"Got this to handle exams and notes for class which it has been able to handle just fine. There were some small hoops to jump through to get int out of ""S Mode"" in order to install important programs.Overall- zero complaints.",0
Mine will not stay connected to my Wi-Fi I'm in the process of moving and if I can't get it connected at the new place I'm going to return it.,0
"I bought this for a young child when it was on sale during Prime Day. We already had a 15"" Vivobook and like the brand/model. After receiving the laptop, I was happily surprised that the screen is better than the 15"" Vivobook we bought in 2020. Screen is crisp and bright and you can't see pixels or dots. The laptop is light and compact, but just be aware you won't have 10-key touch as a trade-off for the size.It came pre-installed with Windows 11 S mode. I've never had experience with S mode and it was slightly annoying to uninstall and convert to Windows 11 Home. I knew it only had 4GB of RAM, but it surprisingly wasn't too sluggish. It's enough for basic web browsing with a few tabs open, but it'll probably be slow if you have background processes and updates running at the same time. I immediately added 8GB of RAM for a total of 12GB and could notice an improvement. Usually the harddrive is a bottleneck, but that's not an issue with this laptop's NVMe M.2 drive. 128GB is enough for what we use it for, but it's nice to know you have an SSD slot open for future upgrades, or just swap out the M.2 drive. There is no SD or MicroSD card reader, so you'll need to use a USB drive or adapter if that's important to you. The 15"" Vivobook does have a MicroSD slot, so I was disappointed that they didn't include it with this 14"" laptop.I've bought budget laptops before, but this is one of the best ones in terms of screen quality, fast hardware, and weight & feel. If you're considering a Chromebook for your child's schoolwork, I think this is a better alternative, as I've found most cheap Chromebooks to be too small and limiting in their abilities.",0
"So far we have had no problems with it. We bought it for my daughter for college. If there are any hiccups come fall, I can resubmit.",0
"Simple and quick setup. No software or function issues. With that said there was a small damage on the back of the laptop display. The smooth metal finish is aesthetically pleasing but the multiple imperfection show up quite easily. This does affect the overall perception of the product, which seem to have flaws in the manufacturing process. There were no issues with the packaging however.",0

"After a month of use, I can confidently say that this is an excellent laptop. All games I've played on it automatically recommend max graphics, and they play perfectly. Just be sure to update all drivers once you unbox, since the preinstalled ones are out of date by now. I've had no hardware or performance issues.The laptop does get a little warm when playing newer games on max settings, so I'd recommend getting a cooling pad. But even without a cooling pad, I've had no heat warnings or issues, so I might just be overly cautious.",0
Died on me after six months. Its not taking charge nor can I get it to turn on after just 6 months..I hope I can get this fixed but buyer beware!,0

"The OOBE is pretty solid besides the Windows 10 latest update and Windows 11 push to break your soul. However, not an MSI issue. The fan is louder than I thought, but that's what laptops do. My friend recommended this one over the product above it and so far so good. Games are smooth, temperature is steady, and things are alot better now. I will say I wish I had gotten this thing sooner. I get all the games my friends play and I'm finally happy with graphics.",0
Absolutely love my laptop. Plenty of memory and resolution is wonderful. Plenty fast enough and I multi task with several windows and programs open. Exactly what I wanted and even has a backlight for keyboard.,0
Haven't had it two weeks completely crashed they only gave 30% back to me will never buy on here again.bought same one through ebay works fine.,0
Completely non -functional right out of the box. Would not charge with the charger that out came with. Spent hours on the phone trying to fix it. Gave up and returned it. A complete fail.,0
"First off, I would be reviewing this laptop for build quality, its screen, sound quality, and obviously the performance. Since the review might become lengthy, I will state that I truly enjoy this laptop and do not regret buying at at such a low price point. At the time of this review, the price has jumped up to $950; much greater than the $850 I got it for in early May. I have been using this laptop for about 2 and a half months and feel like I should be able to give a detailed review.Build Quality: 3.8/5The entire laptop is covered in plastic but it does not feel cheap. The primary issue I have with the plastic is that in some areas, it doesn't feel sturdy. The screen can easily flex if you grab it on both sides and barely move it. Compared to my sibling's Samsung Odyssey, the plastics used on this laptop are much cheaper feeling and less durable. The plastic right above the function keys also feels slightly flimsy and thin. Other than that, the laptop is very solidly built for the price point.Screen: 3/5The screen has horrible viewing angles and at dim settings, it's hard to see even while indoors. I can't imagine how bad it would be if I was outside during a summer day trying to accomplish any work on this laptop while at a cafe. When the screen is set at the perfect angle and brightness, it's a decent screen at most. If the panel was IPS with a glass cover rather than whatever is currently covering the panel, the quality would be so much more realistic. I currently hook up my laptop to a 24inch Samsung monitor that has much better viewing angles and color accuracy.Sound: 2/5The speakers are mounted at the bottom of the laptop by the LED indicators to the left and right of the trackpad. They sound muffled and quiet due to them being pointing towards the table rather than your face. If the speakers were mounted at the empty area above the function keys, sound quality would be much improved and clearer. The headphone port does not disappoint and can decently power my 50ohm HD598s.Performance: 4/5For a 1050TI, it can run fortnite at 60FPS at Ultra and High settings (Ultra For view distance, High for everything else except shadows and anti-aliasing, shadows are turned of and AA is on medium). There are some moments after playing for 2 or 3 hours that it start to thermal throttle a bit and my FPS drops to 15 to 30 fps. This happens even with me turning up the fan speeds in the advanced settings in the MSI Dragon Center and using a laptop cooler with 4 fans at max speed. I can easily run Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance at 60FPS at max settings, no issues and I have low CPU and GPU temps of at most 60C. On League of Legends, I put shadows on low, effects on high, and everything else at MAX and cap the FPS at 80. The FPS hovers around 68 to 73 during decent teamfights and sometimes drops down to the high 50s during 5v5 teamfights near Baron. I would think with improved cooling, the laptop would perform more consistently in Fortnite, but in League; I would say slightly lowering my settings would keep it at 80 no problem. The problems I've stated would be fixed if I had gotten the version with a 1060 but that was far out of my budget.TL;DR: Plastics are cheap in some areas, the screen is overall not good, the speakers are subpar, the GPU performs well in popular titles such as Fortnite and League of Legends at 60fps at medium to high settings. Higher settings such as Ultra or max in some areas would start to thermal throttle the computer and cause FPS drops.",0
Bought this chromebook for wife who loves it. Great for the limited use she needs... internet access and email basically.,0
Lost for words it's that good,0
"Bought March 9th 2022, today is August 21st 2022. Replaced power cord a moth ago, today the laptop fried and died.",0
"The screen cover was broken after 1 year an 1 month of gentle use - that means just 1 month after the European warranty finished. ASUS service is pretty much non existent for laptops out of warranty in Europe (Romania): they told me that I have to leave the laptop at the service for 90 days. Obviously, I can't stay 90 days without laptop, I can not work, so this means they simply don't want to fix it. I must search for the screen cover over the internet, then buy and fix it in ""DIY"" regime. I'll never buy again from ASUS.",0
Graphics are very detailed. The weight is not to bad giving all of the specs. The speed is great. I can do my school work and press one but to switch into game mode which is TOP TIER! Love it!,0
"While I am still checking out all of the features of this gaming laptop, so far I really love it!!!",0
The screen is full HD which is nice for movies and games,0
"Received this laptop about a week ago and I can't think of anything significant to gripe about. The display is sharp and the keyboard is surprisingly very comfortable. The fans are quiet enough to where I barely ever notice them, this isn't the case with other gaming laptops. I very much enjoy my marathon sessions in games like Hearts of Iron 4. And so I was very happy to see that the performance stayed strong, even into the late game, where HoI 4 can be notorious for majorly slowing down. This laptop doesn't make me miss my gaming desktops very much. Can't ask for much more than a well-rounded laptop that makes gaming, while traveling, feel like home.",0
Excelente maquina,0
"Bought this at $650, and I have yet to play a game it can't run smoothly. Bought a 2TB storage device, so the 250 GB storage issue wasn't a problem.",0
"I was worried being that the specs weren't quite as nice as the next level up laptop, but truthfully, this laptop packs a punch! It's perfect for office work, as well as gaming. I've noticed a Facebook game times out occasionally, but I blame Facebook for that. I have another game that I run from the cloud and it's perfect, never a glitch or error. I'm so in love with this sweet laptop!! I purchased directly through Amazon because Lenova was wanting TOO much for the same laptop and they were not very customer friendly.",0
"Purchased because it had most of the features I was looking for, light enough for travel, and the aesthetics were a bonus.",0
worked great but 2 years later it is dead. i wish it would have lasted longer.,0
It runs all my games smoothly but the battery life is on the lower end(about 4 1/2 hours of battery life on the lowest setting). Overall this is still a good laptop.,0
This product has quality for the money.,0
"If you are a developer and enjoy Linux you wont have much left (1GB) to play with.I am no chrome OS or even Linux expert so do not know how to apt install on a SD card - anyone know ?Also GIT does not work due to file permissions on SD Cards due to Google's annoying lockdown of the /mnt/chromeos/removableIf you are not a developer its a great machine - super keyboard - great battery life - I am using it in Aus with a Aussie to US travel adapterWith 128 GB or more SD card with a good bit rate (V30 or better ) you can store loads of video, photos or downloadsThere is no comparison to windows - much more enjoyable on a less powerful processor and 4GB ram is fine ....",0
"Packaging was fine and the box was neat with no dents. When I saw the item I was so excited. Unfortunately when I turned on the laptop, it was glitching out from the start. The audio was fine too. I was so disappointed. The look and feel of the laptop is great. Will be returning and ordering a replacement.",0
"My son loves it, perfect for school!!",0
"The only thing I didn't like about it is that the audio does not work that well, you can barley hear it. You have to use head phones to hear it clearly. I would not buy this again. Did not work for me, but maybe for others.",0
"After almost 2 years of having mine, the battery is as good as new and is a great option for an inexpensive computer.",0
Dells are always decent.,0
"Great laptop. Temps are great during triple AAA gaming (ranging from 30 to 88) cooling is a little loud but does a great job from sustained playing. Playing on mixture high\medium\low settings. CPU is fantastic. I may have gotten a good chip. Out of the box was a Cinebench score of 4354 and a performance mode of 4834. So far so good, for $1000 I couldn't be happier. Will update if anything happens or if it continues to impress.",0
"The S mode is my biggest turn off. This laptop is good for kids or light use. To be usable for more ... the SSD, RAM and OS should be upgraded. But, that is still cheaper then buying something with all these upgrades already installed.",0
I played some Overwatch for a bit and I didn't hear the fans spool up or burn my fingertips from the thermal temperature of the CPU.,0
keyboard is fantastic and plesent to type on,0
"I had great experiences with Chromebooks in the past (HP, Samsung, and Acer), but this particular one seems to have hardware problems.So far I've literally spent more time recovering the OS than using the machine. I can only use the OS for half to one hour, then it slowly freezes completely (first tabs don't load, then cursor won't move), until I must power-cycle the poor box. One out of a few tries I manage to get the OS recovery dialog, sometimes the machine won't power on at all. Recovery succeeded once so far, froze about five or six times.I could ramble on and on, but I'm sure it's just this one machine and probably just a faulty memory module. But I can't even restore the OS (recovery hangs) to run a memtest on this otherwise brand new laptop.",0
"This laptop is most definitely one of the best there is for its price range. To start the build quality of this laptop is impressive, lots of metal and a really sturdy and rugged design compared to other laptops that seem to try and save money at this price point by using cheap plastic. Games run great on this you can expect at least 60 fps on most AAA titles on high settings, some more graphically intensive games you may need to lower these settings but overall great laptop definitely recommend.",0
Video from the built-in screen is crisp and sharp.,0
"it's a solid feeling machine, and a suave looking one.",0
Don’t know if mine is defective but I cannot play any YouTube video without it stopping to buffer every 2 seconds. It’s not my internet because my PC runs fine with it. The screen also goes black for 30-45 seconds when it decides to freeze randomly. Bad investment,0
"es perfecta, liviana, rápida y se ve genial",0
good but too small.,0
I had one for school and was very happy about it. But this one is kind slow and also it is not touch screen,0
This is the worse laptop I ever had but also the cheapest one I ever bought. It is soooooo slow. I gave it to my daughter and she can only run one program or it will lag. Oh god. Terrible,0
Runs nice and quick. Breeze to set up. This is my first Chromebook. Not a complete replacement for a laptop but good for its purpose. No bloat ware which is nice. I was apprehensive that size would be too small but it is fine. I thought that 4G of RAM might be insufficient but browses fine.,0
works great. Daughter school uses chrome for everything.,0
I only have one thing I didn’t like.... it actually has nothing to do with the computer!I LOVE the computer but when the delivery guy destroyed our yard because they drove through it and got stuck is really aggravating! This is NOt the first time they have done this! And we have asked multiple times NOT to do it! We have multiple areas where Amazon workers have drove in our yard and messed it up! They tell us that they will fix it but never do! My mother in law and father in law are pissed so be prepared for a call from them :-),0
The build quality of this laptop is solid.,0
Beware!!! This Chromebook has an AUE date of June 2022. Which means I had a secure device for 3 years! I feel ripped off.,0
"It was black screening randomly, games started running horribly, it was very odd and inconsistent.",0
"La pantalla IPS se ve muy bien, tiene NumPad y el teclado es muy comodo. La refrigeracion es muy buena y funciona muy bien con el programa NITROsense para controlarla. Si estas buscando algo accesible para poder jugar cualquier juego, muy recomendada. Tiene un slot libre para agregar un disco mas de almacenamiento interno.",0
Easier to use,0
I don’t like android based technology. It is t comparable with Microsoft.,0
"When I saw the specs included a 50-tier (3050ti) GPU, I was a little worried that it would not have quite enough power for all my games. Obviously, a dedicated GPU would run some of my older games that I wanted to play, but I was worried about some of the more demanding ones. It turns out my worries were for nothing!This laptop has been great for every game I've thrown at it, from older games to new games that came out this year! Most of the games I've played even run at near-top or top-quality settings! Now, there are a couple of caveats to this claim. First, I'm running these games at 1080p. 4K might be a different story. Also, there are far more demanding titles out there (EX: Cyberpunk) that I have not tried. However, this laptop's 3050ti is far more capable than I originally gave it credit for!Another nice surprise came when I opened up the back panel. The expandability of this laptop is much better than many other modern laptops on the market. It has 2 m.2 NVMe slots and 2 ram slots, which allows you to expand the original capabilities of this laptop!A lot of the Legion laptops have LED lighting around the side and on the lid as well and this one does not. It's nice to still have it on the keyboard, but the options are a lot more limited on this model. Speaking of the keyboard, the typing position, although offset, is pretty comfortable and feels good. It doesn't feel cheap and the travel is decent, with a nice satisfying click.Airflow can be a bit of an issue. When placed on a flat surface, the airflow becomes somewhat restricted and the fans need to ramp up to max to keep up when running games. However, with just a little extra space under the laptop with something like a portable stand (or just one that doesn't have a solid surface supporting the laptop), airflow is significantly increased and the fans usually spin down to a medium speed.While this laptop isn't the most powerful on the market, I really like the balance of performance and energy/battery efficiency and overall I am very happy with this laptop!",0
"I needed a new laptop for my online college classes and this seemed like a great option. I did some researching before buying to make sure it could perform the functions necessary. The product arrived and I was shocked at how lightweight it is! It’s so compact and looks amazing. Set up was a breeze, and I’ve already started using it with no issues. It is my first time using the chrome OS and it’s very user friendly and the graphics are great. Amazing product and price point.",0
"This is not a review based on the seller but based on Asus. I bought this computer primarily as a back up that I could use for 3d CAD programs such as SolidWorks. Computer ran great for a few months then stopped loading the system software. First appearance was that it was a BIOS issue but it wasn't. At this point it had only been used between 10-20 hours and it was set aside and nearly forgotten about.Final verdict was it had to go back to Asus. While there I was treated with a disregard I've only found in people who can not communicate in English. After they had the computer several weeks they contacted me stating the repair would cost nearly $500. That was argued and they did the repair for free, replacing the motherboard and the hard drive as they were both faulty. That repair took another almost 6 weeks.Received the computer back and needed to reformat the thing because Asus left their own profiles and admin lockout on the system. When they were contacted again they stated that they received the laptop with scratches all over the top, bottom, and screen. That was a pure lie, I can take photos of it now and prove that there are no scratches anywhere in the computer.Also when it was shipped back from Asus they packages it in such a half a$$ed manner that I was amazed it wasn't destroyed. They stated to ship to them with 2 inches of padding/packing in all sides. What they shipped back was maybe ½"" of foam, less than adequate.I wish I'd paid more attention because if I'd dealt with it immediately I could have returned to the seller for a refund. Instead I'm stuck with a computer I don't trust to last that supposedly now is out of warranty. This was my second Asus laptop and it will be the last Asus product I ever purchase.",0
"Great laptop for the price paid, I am SUPER pleased with the purchase and the quality of it. It is incredible that it has that price",0
"This computer shipped really fast, it came a day late but amazon took care of that.",0
I use this for my online classes in college and homework! good for basic college needs!,0

Don’t buy it.,0
This laptop would begin the same test at 50 and drop down into the low teens for WiFi connection.,0
"I just got the laptop today so this review is not for longevity, but there are a few things worth noting.#1 - This laptop is beautiful. Pictures don't do the keyboard justice. This is my 3rd MSI laptop and the so far this is one feels and looks the best. Even the response from the keyboard feels good (just enough spring back after pressing keys).#2 - This might be a Windows thing but once I got through the default setup screens, installation windows all looked fuzzy. Well apparently by default the zoom level for apps in the Windows settings was 125%. After setting it to 100% all text looks correct, the screen is crystal clear and overall looks amazing.I'll update this review later after I've had some quality time with the laptop. But so far I'm impressed.Update 11/29/2021 - I've had this laptop for over a year and have had no problems whatsoever. Everything has worked as expected. If I had to choose a downside it would be that the fans can really rev up and get loud when gaming and all that heat can really heat up your lap. But that's to be expected with this graphics card so its not the fault of the computer. I'd buy this again in a heartbeat.",0
Muy bien producto y excelente precio,0
"Since I do not often require the use of the sound system I will not deduct 1 STAR for a very lousy sound system!I had a Toshiba Qosmio that I gave to my wife. I paid the same price for that Laptop as the Acer Predator I'm reviewing. The Toshiba came with a Hardon Kardin Sound System that I really enjoyed!! But, then that Laptop was made in Japan too.",0
"Me parece que estamos ante la reina del verano 2021 en cuanto a laptops accesibles y con más que buenas prestaciones.Llevo ya casi dos semanas de uso y ni una sola queja! Si lo que buscas es una máquina para estudiante de preparatoria o carreras que no requieran de software avanzado o para un profesor@, dar o recibir clases en línea ésta es la mejor opción.Es bastante rápida, sencilla de usar, Windows 10 instalado (es muy fácil quitar el Modo Seguridad para instalar distintas aplicaciones. La cámara web es HD (720P) suficiente para clases en línea fluídas. El micrófono es excelente. Pantalla 10/10, Full HD. Bocinas estéreo, con volumen suficiente para el usuario nada impresionante.Además su RAM es expandible y también su alamcenamiento interno.Si quisieras un poco más de ella recomiendo comprar una ram de 8GB y así quedarías más que sobrado con 12gb de RAM.En fin, si tu objetivo es usar programas sencillos, consumir multimedia, dar o recibir clases no lo pienses dos veces, es opción quasi insuperable!",0
"Just got this bad boy and I have to admit I am impressed so far with MSI build quality.The screen is beautiful, IPS is the way to go, 144hz can't complain.Price is good for what you get, a strong cpu and gpu that will give you at least three good years of little to no compromise gaming. Very little deck flex on the keybroad, keys are crisp with a decent click, it not the best laptop keybroad but it is far from the worse.Cons:Gamery aesthetics, though the backlit keybroad being RGB is a good thing.Construction is mostly plastic and cheapens the look of the laptop but I understand they need to save money somewhere. Cooling could always be better on most gaming laptops but at this price point I can't really complain but the fans do get loud; so have some good headphones.",0
Killer laptop Asus built it to last brilliant.Asus you keep on making the best.2022 12th Gen Intel I7 RTX3060 Mux switch Thunderbolt 4.Pricing unreal. Was worth the wait thanks Asus,0

"This is by far the worst computer I have used in the past 20 years. It doesn't come with Microsoft office, this is why this laptop is cheaper. The product spec claims up to 3.4 Ghz, when you open the task manage it states it's a 1.6 Ghz, far cry from 3.4 Ghz. I bought this laptop to do word, excel, surf the Internet and read e-mails. This morning, it took about 5 minutes to open an excel doc. The fan always runs like crazy and the fan is loud, I can't figure out what is going on in the background. I buy a lot of items from Amazon and I have never written a review, basically because I've always been satisfied, but not this time. I will never buy a PC/Laptop from Amazon again after this experience. I will buy it from somewhere I know exactly what I am getting, I can try it out and have it supported.",0
Not sure if its the systems speakers or not but they are kinda low. Other than that i am very satisfied with my purchase and its performance.,0
"Perfecta, no muy grande ni muy pequeña, la pantalla NO es táctil y la resolución podría ser mejor pero si la necesitas para lo más básico es ideal.",0
"Update: finally cracked her open. Gorgeous serviceability. Room for a second drive: EITHER 2.5"" or M.2. I easily removed the 2.5"" caddy and installed another 1TB M.2 with just a small Phillips and some guitar picks.Low bloatware. Solid build. Decent cooling.Hybrid mode shuts off the graphics card to save battery, but overheats if you actually play a game (easy to switch off). The GPU is an incredible value. Benchmarking it shows you're within 10% of the RTX 2060 mobile.Keyboard has nice concave keys with good click and matte finish. Screen is a touch brighter than most. SSD is a blazing Samsung, not some random knockoff. 4 USB ports + 1 USB-C is solid.Battery is 2-4 hours depending on mode. Possibly more if you disable the discrete graphics in settings.",0
"I'm a Samsung fan and was not disappointed with this as my first Chromebook. As to performance, faster than my windows laptop for startup but for navigating and applications its about the same but I'm running an i7 on my laptop. I wouldnt describe this as light weight and it's a bit bulkier than my win laptop. Battery life has been much better on my chromebook though.",0
exactly what I wanted.,0
"The color schemes are great, and i really like the lightbar.",0

Gets super hot from the bottom (77c at max setting) and my RGB keys aren’t working well.,0
"I like the screen quality but the storage memory is too low, and the audio volume max is at a pitch below a whisper.",0
"My 11 year old grandson loves PC Gaming and wanted a gaming laptop in order to play when he comes to visit and when they travel. It's awesome right out of the box, extremely fast and with no lagging. We did order and added 8gb of ram and 1tb of memory. Can't touch this ... For the price !!!",0
"Some people have noted in their reviews that the quality of the {…} feature is good “considering the price” … No. Even though this laptop is under $500, some features should not be as bad as they are.The screen on this laptop is decent, but it could be better, brighter, and less dull. I initially did not care much about the design of the laptop, but if you need something sleek and sexy, then this model is not the best.My biggest pain point with this laptop is the webcam. There is no reason that the webcam shouldn’t even be 2001 quality. The video has terrible playback, lag, and you will appear extremely fuzzy and grainy. For nearly $500 this webcam should be better. There’s no reason for the horrible level of quality considering ASUS is a company claiming to be making breathtaking products… hah.When I went to Walmart to look at comparably priced and even cheaper laptops, like the chrome book, their webcams were much more crisp and clear.If you need a laptop for web calls, this is not the laptop for you. I purchased this laptop for a family member who does not do much on the computer besides personal work…but the quality is still terrible. No one should have to settle for a computer that is only good if you “just want to browse the internet and watch YouTube videos…” It’s 2021 and the bar should be set higher.",0
My wife is happy with it.,0
"The laptop specs are good, and the laptop itself seems to have good performance but he screen is just plain horrible, even after trying to calibrate it color reproduction is really bad.Also there are small defects on the aluminum casing and the track pad is a bit sub par.Good specs to price ratio, but the screen just make it not really worth it.",0
Keeps getting the blue screen of death,0
Bought two units. One failed after one month using it. Probably it has failed before and was never repaired. Will never buy “Renewed” again.,0
This is a pretty good laptop for the price. It has run every game I've tried well. Would recommend,0
The 144hz 1080p monitor is very nice and the small beezle at the edge makes viewing a pure pleasure,0
"This computer is a good buy and works very well. My only complaint is that I have been a pc user all of my life (more than 60 years) and I am having some challenges with the OS. Not their fault. Delivery, packaging, speed, and everything seems really good. I am satisfied.",0
I purchased it for a young man who broke his last laptop and needed a good replacement. He is very satisfied for what he uses it for and is just head-over-heals pleased with its performance.,0
The keyboard is completely messed up. Was online with support forever trying to fix it and had a pro look at it. Both concluded it was manufactured poorly. I can't type and it's past 30 day warranty/return policy from where i got it. :/,0

"Great performance, when it’s connected, but even in power saver mode the battery does not last more then a few hours. I can’t even make it through a class lecture before it dies. Very disappointed.",0
Wasn’t even the computer I order and o paid 537 for this why did I get a different computer Please respond to me this is not right,0
Good deal,0
"I purchased this laptop as a replacement for my 10+year-old desk top. I'm retired and I was concerned that the transition was going to be difficult as I am not tech savvy. In addition, I was worried about switching to Windows 10. The main uses for my laptop is for family photos and some word processing (letters, including the envelope!). For that purpose I have added Wordperfect -- which also included a program for spreadsheets. I am so happy with this computer. It is so easy to use and I have not had one of those moments where I wanted to pull out my hair -- which was not how it was with an android tablet I purchased not knowing any better. I am happy with my purchase.",0
It's exceptionally good. Has a light weight which makes it portable/handy.,0
Didn’t have speaker and battery didn’t hold charge,0
"I needed a laptop for work (while traveling). I had no issues connecting to Wi-Fi. I was able to download everything I need for work (healthcare) and it runs great. It's a little heavy but I carry in a backpack so it's not bad, the battery lasts about 3 hours, which is great, I think! I live that it has 10 key! And it didn't cost me an arm and a leg!!! My husband will be using for school (master's degree) and my kid uses it occasionally when his chromebook won't connect to Wi-Fi. Definitely worth the buy!!!",0
I love everything about this laptop except for the camera. I purchased the laptop for video conferencing while working from home and the camera picture is grainy and blurry because it's only a 480p. I wish I would have noticed that before I ordered it. If you don't need it for the camera then it's a nice laptop. Going to purchase a different laptop with a 1080p camera and use this one for something else.,0
Perfect product for all my business needs. I use this with Quickbooks online along with many spreadsheets.I am receiving a 90day extension on my computer in order to write this review.,0
Thought i was getting a good deal on what seemed to be a good item only to find out its EXTREMELY slow and the screens will not load. i know it is not my internet connection because i have great internet connection and have trouble shot it and illiminated it as the problem.i've had to restart it almost everytime in order to bring up a different web page or even just the device setting page! Keys are also not full working and require i press them harder then normalI WILL be returning the item even though i might not get the full refund!!! NOT IMPRESSED OR HAPPY,0
Runs slow,0
it does get the computer pretty hot,0
"I purchased my GL65 Leopard after doing extensive research on other laptops in the price range of $1100-$1500, and I can say this is without a doubt the best bang for your buck. It is immensely powerful with the i7-10750H and RTX2070 combo, no other laptop around this price point offers both. You may choose to upgrade RAM and storage, but every game I have tested on this runs on the highest graphics settings without a worry. The fans aren't any louder than similar gaming laptops, but if you're expecting a quiet rig you will sacrifice performance or be paying a lot more. Overall extremely satisfied with my purchase and will be buying MSI again in the future (Which won't be for a while because this laptop is fairly future proof!)",0
"Acer has really hit it out of the park with their Helios 300 gaming laptop line, in terms of offering high end gaming laptop specs at a reasonable price. This laptop offers both a high end laptop NVIDIA graphics card (RTX 3060) and a fairly high end 11th generation Intel processor (I7-11800H). They include a 144Hz refresh rate FHD display. They throw in a fast 512Gb NVMe boot drive, a Killer/Intel Ax1650i Ethernet/WiFi system, and a generous array of laptop ports. All at a price that's considerably cheaper than competitors are asking laptops with comparable specs.If you're looking for specs at the best price, this has what you're looking for. Add to that good quality build, a very efficient fan/vent system, and decent aesthetics, and you may think about ending your search now. Because you won't find a comparable quality system with comparable specs for less.But there are some downsides. Battery life is pretty poor. You'll get maybe 3.5-4 hours if you put the laptop in Default mode, turn down the brightness, and focus on tasks that don't require the NVIDIA GPU. So, for example, simple video streaming or web surfing. 3.5 hours is not enough for a long plane trip, nor for a take-along laptop for a whole day's classes. And things get a lot worse if you put it into gaming mode (e.g. Turbo). Compared to 10+ hours available with today's road warrior laptops, you can see what you're getting into here. This isn't a gaming laptop that doubles as a do-everything portable. If you need portable and good battery life (and lighter weight--this weighs 5 1/2 pounds), consider something else. This is fine for a trip to the coffee shop for an hour or two.But if you're a gamer first, you may well be willing to make that trade off.Beyond the weak battery life, the other significant negative about this laptop is the keyboard. For reasons I don't fathom on a gaming laptop, Acer has chosen to shrink the keyboard on the left side to make room for a dedicated keypad. As a result, I find typing cramped, and find myself frequently hitting the wrong key. The chicklet style keys are also not the most comfortable I've used on a laptop. If you're using this at home, you'll almost certainly want to move to an external keyboard. Which is kind of a shame since the backlit keyboard, with the colored LEDS, IS quite pretty for a laptop keyboard.Two other so-so components are the Webcam--which only supports HD (1280x720) and isn't all that great, and the built-in speakers. The speakers get the job done, but don't get that loud and are fairly lacking in bottom end. I've heard better laptop speakers, for sure.Balancing out the weaknesses in battery and keyboard is plenty of easy expandability and upgradability. There are THREE (!!!) mass storage connections in the laptop: Two NVMe connections (one holding the boot drive from the factory), and a place for a third, 2.5"" drive. There are two memory slots, one of which holds the 16Gb memory stick for the base configuration. A maximum of 32Gb are supported, if you add a second 16Gb stick. The WiFi card is also easily accessed once the back cover is off, if you decide you want to upgrade the WiFi capabilities in the future. Removing the back cover is straightforward: Remove 11 screws on the bottom, then carefully pry the cover off (there are a few clips around the edges that will release with a careful pull).Unlike many recent laptops, Acer is pretty generous here with connection ports. You get:1x Thunderbolt 4 port (USB-C)1x USB (Type A) 3.2 gen 2 (10 Mb/s)2x USB (Type A) 3.2 gen 1 (5Mb/s)1x HDMI1x Mini-Displayport1 x Gigabit Ethernet port1/8"" headphone jackThe inclusion of both the latest-and-greatest Thunderbolt 4 port (capable of both 40 Mb/s speeds and supporting up to 2 x 4K/60Hz or 1x 8K/60Hz monitor) is a plus. It's also nice there are three type-A USB ports, all of which are USB 3, and one of which is the faster USB 3.2 gen type. Providing support for both Mini-DisplayPort AND HDMI is icing on the cake.Power is supplied via a barrel-type power port on the back of the laptop. The power supply is rated for up to 200W. There's no indication that the laptop can be charged through the Thunderbolt port, and there are few generic charger options for 200W in any event.Value added software included with the laptop includes a copy of the excellent video editing program Cyberlink Powerdirector, the the DTS sound processing application for speakers attached through the 1/8"" mini-jack. There's also a control program for the Killer/Intex Ax1650i card.I ran the popular 3D Mark benchmarking program on the laptop in three modes: Balanced, Extreme, and Turbo. These three modes can be toggled through the Acer/Predator app that comes pre-installed. Turbo mode can also be toggle on/off via a dedicated button the keyboard. Results for the benchmark game Time Spy are (see photos):Balanced: Graphics Score: 7057, CPU Score: 6403Extreme: Graphics Score: 7568, CPU Score 7616Turbo: Graphics Score 7884, CPU Score 7684The various modes appear to be doing what they should, with the scores improving as you ladder up in overclocking. Given the nominal improvement for Extreme-> Turbo, which also turns on the loud fans permanently, I am not sure that's a power option most people will choose.SummarizingProsHigh end discrete graphics card (NVIDIA RTX 3060)Good cpu (Intel I7-11800H @ 2.30Ghz, 8 cores, 16 thread)Very generous port assortment, including Thunderbolt 4144Hz 3ms refresh rate FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS screen, no touchFast NVMe 512Gb boot drive (Samsung MZVL2512HCJQ-0080)Expansion for TWO additional storage devices (1xNVME, 1x 2.5"" drive)Expansion for additional memory stickBack cover relatively easy to remove to access componentsComes with Cyberlink Powerdirector and DTS softwareOffers multiple pre-tuned options for speed/overclock/fan noiseVery pretty backlit keyboard with multi-color LEDsConsOnly fair battery life (< 4 hours in nominal use mode, closer to 2 hours in Turbo game mode)Keyboard squeezed to make way for number pad and a bit uncomfortable/clumsy to use long termUnder stress, fans are very loudWeak built-in speakersMediocre built-in webcamOnly comes with 16Gb of memory, 32Gb would have been preferred512Gb of storage is fine for productivity apps, but gamers will almost certainly require more for gamesDespite the cons, I think this is a lot of laptop for the price, and as long as you can live with the practical need to be on a power source if you're going to do any serious gaming with it, this is probably going to be the most attractive gaming laptop for a lot of people at its price point.",0
"This laptop is a great deal at $1,199. I did a lot of shopping around before purchasing it and I couldn't be happier. Zero problems and I have been astounded by the workload this PC can handle.My only complaint is a 512GB hard drive is a little small for gamers, but there is an open 2.5"" slot which is easily accessible.",0
"Hands down the worst/most frustrating laptop I've ever owned.I've had this laptop for a couple of years now. After one year the internal fan bearings degraded so the fan started making an ungodly loud rattle. I was quoted almost $200 to repair it (taking apart the laptop to get at the fan is a very delicate process). I can't tell you how annoying this is.Also, the laptop turns itself off at seemingly random times if I leave it alone for more than a few minutes, necessitating a full reboot and restoring of all programs that were running at the time. Just infuriating.The advantage of this laptop is the low price, but you're definitely getting what you pay for. Never again.",0
"First of all it's a beautiful notebook. Very well build, aluminum body, relatively light when you compare to same category notebooks. Great screen, 120hz makes a difference even when you are working on word or PowerPoint. Great trackpad. My second notebook is MacBook pro, and I would say the razer has a better overall build quality.When you're not using it for gaming it has a good battery life, around 5 hours. But when gaming it's not so good. Beware that you won't get full power of your gpu if you are not plugged in.... I noticed that when I was running shadow of the Tomb raider and I was making 50fps avarege, as soon as I plugged at the outlet it jumped to 75fps.It has all the ports that you're gonna need... USB, thunderbolt, hdmi, mini display....It's a great notebook, but of course you're paying a premium for the razer quality, you can get same spec notebook for less, but not same quality.That's my humble opinion. Hope it was helpful.",0
love this new chromebook! I cannot believe how quick it boots up and I can check all my emails in less time than it used to take windows to even come up!,0
