Everything positive about it.,0
"Received new and gmail wouldn't load properly because the old browser wasn't supported. Attempted to download new chrome OS and it took about 4 hours to download and wouldn't ever complete the process. Called acer and they said there was nothing they could do, they suggested I tried chromebook support which told me to powerwash the device and reboot. Which I did and nothing happened. Spent hours researching the problem, seems another user that ordered around black friday also had the same bug. Very frustrating experience. Will buy better chromebook x 360 (14 inch version) from Best Buy instead for $500 and peace of mind.",0
"the mousepad frequently stops responding/working, which is super annoying.",0
"I received this item legit 2 days ago, and I'm already noticing issues. The track-pad is extremely sensitive, to the point where just hovering over a button will press it. My hand is brushing the trackpad slightly as I'm typing this, and it's highlighting the text and I can't un-highlight. I tried bringing the sensitivity down to the lowest setting, but it hasn't helped. The screen is also turning black at random times. It's not so frequent that it's a serious issue, but I've also only had it for 2 days and something is already malfunctioning. To be fair, this might be a software issue, rather than hardware.There are pros - the laptop is extremely light and sleek. It's very portable, fast, with a great display. Some features I find slightly redundant, like the fingerprint scanner. I am considering returning it, I'll try it out for another week or two and see if the problems persist/if there's a way to fix them.",0
"Absolute garbage. Not durable at all. Monitor flickered intermittently, then died shortly after warranty expired. Invest in something with more durability. I’ll never buy hp again",0
"the chassis and screen have minimal flex, appears to be sturdy",0
"Just what I was looking for, Fast , Light and Great Screen !",0
"A well executed little machine that arrived promptly and in excellent condition. For the price, I don’t mind being a generation behind",0
This laptop is great for high school students and for students in college who don’t need a top end Mac. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made!,0
When gaming CPU would reach +100°C and the game would hit one digit FPS for few seconds.,0
"I am very happy with this purchase. I will say I first saw them at Best Buy and probably should have gotten it there so I could get some help with a quick start - but, as always, Amazon was $20 less expensive and it was on my doorstep in 2 days. I am figuring it out!",0
"build quality is fantastic, VERY VERY solid machine.",0
Good!,0
"Very good laptop overall. The 300Hz screen is great and color reproduction is amazing too. Keyboard is nice and the large trackpad is also very responsive. While playing heavy duty games for a long time make sure to slightly elevate the laptop from the table as it allows for better cooling. I can get around 180-200 frames with low graphics, 100% screen resolution and MUX switch on.This review is written to extend my warranty for the laptop however my views are completely honest and reflect my true experience with the laptop.",0
"Whenever I watched a movie, the sound didn't come out right. The screen was not good and the soundtrack was awful.",0
"El teclado es el único detalle malo a destacar, se siente de muy mala calidad, pero por el precio es aceptable.En cuanto a rendimiento y funciones, es muy muy buena, he trabajado con autocad, photoshop, excel, word y chrome al mismo tiempo, y la máquina corre perfectamente, no ha tenido dificultad en esa situación. Tengo ya casi dos meses usándola y no he tenido problemas. La duración de la batería me parece decente.Es un gran equipo con un muy buen costo, muchas computadoras con las mismas especificaciones que estuve comparando son al menos 3,000 pesos más caras.",0
Didn’t come as discriminated two times!,0
"Es una buena computadora, venía con su caja, manuales, tuve un problema tenía una cuenta de alguien, pero restauré de fábrica quedó al 100, le compré memoria de 4 gb, un DD 1 Tb, Puff la ocupo para AI, Photoshop, me gusto mucho!!",0
"This laptop really exceeded my expectations. I am receiving a warranty extension from ASUS for giving my feedback however I genuinely recommend this product for anyone who is looking to do gaming and be mobile at the same time. It is very light for its purpose, specs and quality.",0
"This is the worst laptop I’ve ever had in my life. My wireless connection was too slow, so I updated the wireless driver and got this resolved. But the battery driver stopped working and now it’s not detected by the OS. The laptop doesn’t turn on without the AC adapter. Already tried to reinstall Windows but didn’t worked as well. And I can’t send it back to amazon because I live in another country. Also, ASUS global warranty assistance does not work in my country Brazil. I bought this laptop a month ago. I’ve been saving money for a laptop for 2 years and now my brand new laptop is broken and useless. I tried everything, since reinstalling official drivers, restoring from a previous point and reinstalling Windows. I can’t even describe my frustration.",0
"I bought this laptop to replace my old Asus Q400a which I absolutely loved. However, for a similar price point laptop to my previous one, I feel like the quality is lacking. The Webcam is horrendous. Its worse that the laptop I bought back in 2013. Such poor camera quality today is, in my mind, unexcusable. Fortunately, I don't use the Webcam much, but since I bought this laptop to use on zoom during quarantine, the poor quality is bothersome. The keyboard has the backlight and spacing that I loved from my previous asus laptop, but they keys themselves feel flimsy and cheap. Additionally, the mouse movement when using the TouchPad is a bit glitchy no matter how I change the sensitivity. It's a bit loud when its on the charger, but very quiet when its off of it. The positives: It is slim and lightweight, so good for travel. The screen resolution is bright and colorful. The overall look of the laptop is sleek. But honestly, if you're looking to buy a new laptop, I would save up some extra money and buy something of better quality if you have the luxury of time, which I did not.",0
"Laptop was supposed to be refurbished but it obviously was not since it still had someone else"" login password on it. Could not reset system to remove password and could not get Windows to load at all.",0
"The laptop was perfect at first, exactly what I needed, but it's been 5 months and I've already taken it to support twice.The first time was about a month ago because it stopped connecting to wifi, it didn't even show the networks. Then, I woke up today with an alert that said that the fan and the battery weren't working properly and the keyboard was all messed up (the letters are pressed forever). How do a fan and a battery break after 5 months of normal use?I bought it and came back to Argentina (where I live), and there's no HP support here so I just have to keep taking it and paying more money to get it fixed.Buy something else.",0
Excellent quality of components and construction,0
"It's annoying but the storage in the computer didn't work, this took a long time to figure out, and caused a lot of hassle. I ordered a new storage device that should work, but one has to wonder why they ship computers with defective memory?If the storage had worked fine I would have given 5 stars, the computer works great otherwise.",0
"Bought two Samsung Chrome books for my kids with an extended warranty. Both devices ran very slow and several computer keys broke off of the keyboard within 5 months of use. I contacted Amazon on 2/23rd and spoke to a representative who is now trying to charge me a restocking fee. Due to the timing of returning the product being 7 days past the expiration date. They are not honoring their policy or extended warranty and a company that makes their customers eat so much as a restocking fee does not value their customer's loyalty. Not to mention, Amazon is getting too big to fail.... they will be the next giant conglomerate that will tank out economy.",0
My friend recently bought this and he said he’s very disappointed because he can’t do what he needs it for so he’s going to be returning it.,0
"With social distancing, we needed something to use for homeschool and work, so this was an excellent fix. Not used for gaming or movies, just school websites and writing papers, so it does exactly what we need it for. This is what the kids use in school anyway, so they know how to get around the Chromebook better than I do!",0
"Computer is great very happy about my purchase, worth the money ?% fast, overall amazing, NOW battery wise they really need to improve it ASAPthat’s why I’m giving them 4 star review.",0
"Now I really only play Sims 4 and Stardew Valley so I can’t give EXPERT advice regarding games like GTA or anything but.. Sims 4, I have A LOT of expansion packs, kits, stuff packs, etc as well as at least 1k worth of mods/cc. My previous laptops used to run so slow even after having about 100 mods/cc along with all the game stuff I bought. This laptop runs PERFECTLY with all of this. Keeping in mind, I have a couple other games and then obviously Steam, Discord and Origin. The battery life has been wonderful. I can play hours without it dying. It doesn’t overheat. It doesn’t crash. It runs smoothly. Overall it’s the best laptop I’ve had. I prefer it over my macbook. And my boyfriend is an Xbox gamer, and even he is jealous of my laptop. He loves it too.",0
Very disappointed! This laptop only worked for two weeks.,0
"Works fine, no complains as at now. I use it for CAD applications and not gaming.",0
"EDITED: It's been 11 months since I've had this computer. It just snapped in half this morning while opening it. The plastic that the hinges are screwed into apparently crystallized. So, it is certainly not a durable computer. I won't be another ASUS.It's everything that I needed. Fast, great specs and affordable. The only cons are that the speakers are really low, and that it gets really noisy if you try to use it on your lap while it's charging. I would buy again and recommend. If you're considering this laptop, get it!",0
I'm happy with my order,0
eyboard feels good and the lights are fairly easy to configure,0
One last positive is that the fans are not too loud when running.,0
"It is showing me vertical lines along with black cracks. It is covering about 2/3 of my screen from left to right, so I cannot see what I am doing in the left area. The remaining area gets covered by white if I close the chromebook downward.",0
There is no fingerprint reader on this device,0
The trackpad has good sensitivity and response as well.,0
N/a,0
I love the color and everything it was more than I thought it would be.,0
no easy access to the SSD or RAM,0
"I bought this laptop at Best Buy a long while ago for myself and decided to surprise my best friend with the exact same one I had from here as a Christmas gift.I've had no complaints with this laptop and he's borrowed mine several times so I though he would appreciate me just getting him his own.He loved it, works like a charm and was a massive upgrade in terms of tech quality for him. Now he's finally able to game in decent quality.",0
"it's a great overall computer, but the battery is awful. After only 2 years my computer has to be plugged in to work, the battery just doesn't work.",0
Webcam light is brighter than most and becomes annoying after a while,0
"This is my second Chromebook since my first one broke from a fall. After numerous days of research this is definitely a great Chromebook for the money the display is excellent and the keyboard works well I also like the fact this includes an HDMI port. Battery life last around 9 hours and it is extremely light. The speakers which are on the bottom put out good sound. Do some research before you buy because a Chromebook though it can do a lot is not a PC but for the price and what it does do is completely worth it. Browse the web, word, excel, and spreadsheet Google alternatives and cloud storage work excellent. Does not need an internet connection to do everything and anything dive offline will be saved and uploaded once you connect to wifi. One thing I which it has was a modem port, but I have an old laptop in the event I need to make changes to my modem.",0
"I gave this purchase a run around and delayed purchasing it for a good while, but I cant stress enough how amazing this computer has been. I take it around with me for studying and playing music and just basic stuff but is amazing, the m1 chip is quite a game changer.",0
Amazing computer for the price.,0
"I usually don’t ever write reviews for products, and I’m writing this review literal months later. Trust me you need this laptop. I’ve heard a lot of people talk about their laptop fans heating up, and keep in mind I am a software developer/3D modeler. I’ve never experienced this before, sometimes the fans may get pretty loud, but outside of that amazing PC, feels high quality.",0
I feel like i got the perfect chrome book for what we need at a good price and fast delivery.,0
"Small, lightweight pretty looking and powerful with lots of speed.",0
i lov it so far,0
This chromebook does everything I need it to without the high cost of Apple products and the sheer inconvenience of Windows.,0
great little laptop for around the house. and my work. except im pretty sure the mouse was put in the wrong way lol other then that.... i would recommend,0
"A great laptop with a RTX 2070 and 10th gen intel processor. You're able to add a secondary 2.5 inch SSD if you like. Any game I've ran so far, Cyberpunk 2077, Doom Eternal, or Gears 5 runs great. You're getting a good gaming laptop for sure, but the battery life isn't good when you're playing a game for more than an hour.",0
Bought this laptop for my dad and he loves it. It works perfectly and it came within no time.,0
I thought it was going to be bigger but i still love it.,0
works great,0
"Very light, with good battery life. Screen is excellent.",0
It took awhile for me to get use to the touchscreen,0
"utilizo para arquitectura y diseño 3d con programas como 3dsmax, sketchup, autocad, vray con un rendimiento optimo incluso superando a mi pc de escritorio, de porte elegante y pequeño en comparacion a mi anterior rog, bastante liviana y facil de transportar, en turbo es un poco ruidosa pero no se calienta mucho que es algo que destacar en un diseño tan fino.. bastante recomendable",0
The description says that the laptop is 512 GB. Mine has only 475 GB.I payed lot of money for this machine and it’s quite disappointing that you don't get what they advertise.,0
it is lightweight and versatile.,0
The only thing I don't like is no where to plug in for internet am using wifi,0
"This is a slick little laptop, especially for the money. The processor flies and the slim size and light weight make it SUCH an improvement over my old balky Dell. The comments in the trade press and here about the track pad are true - its definitely the weak link in the hardware. But I'm getting used to it gradually. For not much money they could make this SO much better with a better pad.",0
I have with this laptop and the Razer brand in general is coil whine.,0
"Setup and use is fine, fast and has the features I want but the screen/image is poor. Very poor contrast makes it impossible to dial in good color and brightness. Image washed out. Used all available software (Intel) but good contrast=too dark. Good brightness=poor contrast. Cannot achieve black blacks and white whites simultaneously. I've seen this in several recent laptops; I see these cheap screens as cutting corners. My old laptops had excellent screens. For the price of this one, the screen should be top quality. Would not recommend to friends.",0
Returned it to Amazon,0
I had to order this for my online classes due to the shut down and its been great so far google froze 3 times but other than that i havent had any issues i havent installed anything other than lock down browser but i plan to start editing videos so i will come back to this review .,0
The Microsoft office needed a key,0
the machine doesn't get exceptionally warm,0
"La verdad la agarre en un buen precio, menos de lo que esta actualmente y no me arrepiento de cada peso invertido, la verdad vale la pena completamente.",0
"Original order arrived with damaged screen; however, I contacted amazon and 2 days later I had the replacement. So far so good. The product itself is awesome.",0
"Tough to beat the value here - small, light, fast, reliable, cheaper than MAcbook Air",0
Been drooling over this laptop for quite a while now. It's awesome! Super light weight and portable and quite powerful. I've been running Matlab on it for robotics without any issues so far.,0
"This was easy to set up. It was a bit of a hassle to transfer files, but not too bad. It is working great for homeschooling and other family needs.",0
"I use this for work on the go. Excellent price, battery life and function.",0
"My wife needed a fairly straightforward work laptop, and the zenbook is a great balance between features, price and weight.The only downside is that the laptop comes with lots of pre-installed crap that needs to be removed. If it came with a clean install it would have been a 5 star laptop for most users.",0
I didn't know that it was a 2018 model. I would like to return it. It was presented as new. I am very upset.Let me know what I need to do.,0
I bought this for my daughter's birthday and I must say it is worth the purchase. She loves it.,0
"Great buy. Using it since day one for work. I am a medical interpreter and I work on camera and so far it responds great. The keyboard very comfortable, I also love how light and thin is the laptop. I couldn’t be happier.",0
We have yet to have any Problems after owning a few months. As described we love it,0
"I put off buying one for so long because everyone I knew had an opinion on chrome books and kept calling them ""basically tablets"". It's a small little laptop. I use it for work, I have an external hard drive for storage. It's exactly what I needed!",0
"I love this computer. I teach students in China English via webcam. This works perfectly. I'm able to run the teaching platform I work for and multiple web pages simultaneously. I love the fingerprint scanner, it makes logging in so fast. The computer is also very light and has a sleek design. I love the back light on the keyboard.",0
"Excellent bang for buck. This is running Final Fantasy XV, Dragon Age Inquisition, Star Wars the Old Republic, Skyrim Special Edition highest graphics all on no problem. Tons of space, awesome backlit keyboard, light for a gaming laptop, fans work excellent... best decision I've made. Though I haven't purchased the game myself other owners online says it does well with Cyberpunk too. Honestly for under 1500, best gaming laptop you can get. Some reviews show that Lenovo doesn't offer good support so I immediately tested that out, I had excellent respond time and good customer service. I'll update this review in a few months to see how it's still performing!",0
The Asus was dim in comparison and colors were not saturated.,0
Good value for money. Had it for some months and I don't have any complaint.,0
"pants received, good quality no words, is what I want, really good, very valuable, cost-effective, good, all five points!",0
It is nice that you can help reduce the internal temperature when you are in some really intense games.,0
"I’ve had it for only 2 years. Hardware malfunction causing blue screen error every 5 mins. Troubleshooting is not helping, eventually found out it’s hardware error. Still looks very new because I’ve taken good care of it. Just disappointed!",0
A bit pricey for the value,0
"So far the asus zenbook 13 has been complete joy to use when it works and meets every demand that I have like running windows 7 on a virtual machine or just doing general classwork. Unfortunately, the build quality is absolute trash. On my first zenbook the screen went absolute bonkers, within a few weeks of purchase and the keyboard would sink whenever I typed, which is more annoying than it sounds. Also the box came with a stain on it. What's up with that? and now the replacement they sent me came with an EVEN dirtier box than the last and the touchpad is loose. Thankfully, those are pretty superficial complaints and I can live with them for now. However, it is pretty ridiculous how shoddy the build quality is on this laptop.",0
I love my new laptop the only draw back is that I have to purchase a USB-C to connect my phone.. other from that everything works well so far,0
"Garbage, bought it in March and crapped out in October. Left. Mouse doesn’t work anymore and the sound went out, literally hasn’t left my desk. Last asus product I buy",0
"It is 15’ AMD R7 3700U, SSD256, with 8gb ram, Win 10 proI bought Samsung 32GB ram and replaced with the existing one, maximum capacity is 64GB and now I have 40 GB of RAM and it is a beast. Opening the chassis was so easy, disconnected the battery and then replaced the ram with new one and that’s it.I also bought WD HHD 1TB of capacity cost me 56 dollars. Installing it was so easy and already cable and case is available inside it. Note that the type I bought is 2.5”, 7mm thick other than this will not fit. After installation go to desk management and you will see the new partition just right click on it and select new simple volume and enter the size you want if need more than one partition and that’s it.Also I changed my WIFI card which is upgradeable to WIFI 6 AX200 NGW.The chassis has good finish, it is plastic but relatively stiff, disappointed with trackpad at the begging however adjusting sensitivity make it much better, nice anti-glare screen with very good brightness, acceptable screen bezel, surprised with the speakers strength, decent camera, very good browsing speed, very happy with the keyboard especially with the caps lock light and other keys shortcuts, of course it would be better with backlit still though to me the best keyboard I’ve ever used. I haven’t tested battery life that much but it seems to me it will lasts for 4-5 hrs with mid to heavy of using.No bloatware at all but Macafee Antivirus.In general, the laptop is very good and I recommend to buy one for home, business, and student users and even for light to mid range gaming of course with using the lowest settings.",0
"So far so good. Fast startup, fast refresh, graphics, videos and photos look great! It does a good job with office work. No complaints and I don't expect any. This is my second MSI replacing a 17"" gamer I bought in 2013. That one is still ticking although it is slower than this one.",0
Love the touch screen@,0
Nice budget laptop,0
"These are pretty good little computers, you won’t find anything with that type of hardware for the price, definitely worth the money",0
"I bought this for my son for college, he had it set up and going in no time. He enjoys the speed and everything that goes with it. Once you remove all the programs that come with it, it's pretty good he has no complaints. He has been using it for about 6 weeks now.",0
It’s a phenomenal laptop for the price hands down,0
"Love it, way faster than my 3rd gen work carbon. And 50x lighter than my personal old Dell latitude.",0
"This computer has completely failed in less than one year and no contact information is available for seller. A new computer failed in one year should be addressed by the seller - no way to this one. Stay far from buying this computer, you will be extremely disappointed.",0
"Unfortunately a terrible Lenovo product! It started freezing after 2 months. After 4 months I have trouble even turning it on. It works for about 10 minutes, freezes completely and I am forced to turn it off with the power button. The power button itself often doesn't react at all. Lenovo will not issue a refud or exchange, they will oly guide you through a drive reset. Don't waste your money!",0
Beware!!! This Chromebook has an AUE date of June 2022. Which means I had a secure device for 3 years! I feel ripped off.,0
It has beautiful color and contrast and really impressed me as soon as I turned the computer on.,0
The fact that the keycaps on this device are removable has opened up a world of customization options for me. It's been fun experimenting with different layouts and designs.,1
"Amazing Laptop, cant be more satisfied :)",0
I was kind of disappointed with the color quality on the screen. It was not as brilliant as I expected.,0
Price is to Samsung highAt Best Buy it's only $99,0
"My old Hp laptop went out and I'm a college student so I needed something right away . This laptop came and it is so lightweight and sleek and feels so good. I love it, the design is good, the keyboard has a wonderful feel to it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a laptop in a pinch. This is such an upgrade from my previous laptop and I love it !!",0
This laptop works perfectly.,0
"Nice laptop, couldn’t be happier.",0
Used this chromebook for four months and then the screen cracked and it is now unusable. These things are too fragile!,0
This was more than I expected. No issues! Great product! I recommend,0
"So I usually wait a good while before I write reviews since I want to get a good feel of the product. That being said, I bought this laptop in May 2021 and so far this laptop is a powerhouse- strong, reliable and fast. Can run multiple programs at the same time without overheating and runs games smoothly. Within the past month however, (April-May 2022) the screen has been experiencing screen tears, ghosting when scrolling or playing videos, flickering at the top edge of the screen and pixeling. And all of this has been happening with no prior damages happening to the laptop. Super unfortunate especially because of the price of the computer and now having to pay extra for a separate monitor to replace this one. I want to recommend it but I'd be super wary and prepare for this possibly happening to you.",0
Computer is slower than I spected,0
Good if you want to surf web,0
Unhappy that it had error messages when starting and then connectivity problems after that. Came without a Windows 11 CD so I can't fix driver issues,0
I LOVE IT!!!! I LOVE THAT I CAN USE AS A TABLET/LAPTOP/PHONE/PORTABLE MOVIE THEATER!!!! I AM HAAAPPY WITH IT!!!!!,0
"I actually like the keyboard as it feels solid, good typing performance, and good enough feedback in the keys to let you feel that you are typing.",0
We shall see how it holds up. I’m satisfied with the product. I only wish the seller would’ve allowed us to buy two as we have twins who both need one for school.,0
"This is a great laptop. It is quiet, very fast and incredibly light if you have to carry it around. Have had several ASUS laptops in the past which were all very reliable and performed great. Hoping that this one performs and lasts as well as the past ones.",0
DOES NOT HAVE A BACKLIGHT KEYBOARD,0
It is lightning fast and the gaming power inside makes for an all around great laptop that is worth every penny,0
"I like everything about it. Fast, easy to use. No problems, would recommend it to anyone.",0
Great litte laptop so far,0
"Compré este equipo para edición de video, la verdad es que no he jugado un minuto en esta computadora. El rendimiento es excelente. Los colores del monitor sí cambian un poco cuando se comparan entre diferentes monitores. El precio que obtuve fue genial. Muy satisfecho con esta compra.",0
buena calidad y precio,0
"*Update 2 months into ownership:Feel free to read the original post below first, but I really want a couple of my main criticisms to show clearly for everyone to see before they consider purchasing this laptop. The first gripe I have is that the touchpad will sometimes lose sensitivity to the point of being unusable for 10-30 seconds before reverting back to normal. This happens too often and while I will look into fixing the issue, it's really annoying. The limited specs cause somewhat frequent bugs to occur that are likely video memory or multitasking related. One of which bugs is how the screen may turn black when watching a video or a page with a video, and the screen will either refresh and go back to normal or force me to go to task manager and end the browser task.Another annoyance is that browsing and tab switching can sometimes be slow especially if multitasking, and you may need to choose between using Edge and Chrome/Firefox depending on the task. Edge is better and smoother for watching videos, especially for twitch.tv (the difference is like night and day between Edge and Chrome) but tends to be buggier than Chrome. I tend to prefer Chrome overall despite admitting to Edge being faster in my original review.The screen is relatively bad. You can get used to it and forget about it while using it, but it's still one of the worst screens I've seen. The colors are washed out because the color gamut is something like 50% sRGB (a good laptop will cover at least 80% of the sRGB range), the viewing angles are horrific and problematic even when staring directly the screen, dead center. The contrast is pretty bad, brightness is decent but doesn't make up for how bad the screen is otherwise.Having so little storage isn't great because it means having to rely on some form of external storage. I use a large microSD card which works but it's slow, and I think the microSD slot is speed limited by the system.Original review:You can get tablets that do basic web browsing for cheaper, but this is an Intel-based laptop that runs Windows 10 and can have S mode disabled so you can install any program you want like you'd expect.At this price point, you just want something that works, and that this laptop does, but it's also really small and light with great battery life. Out of the box, heavy usage will get me around 5-6 hours of battery life, but easily more if I'm doing light usage. I have very little complaints about the build and might even say everything you'd want is nearly all there. Solid, thin yet sturdy frame with good hinge tilt. The chiclet keyboard is quite usable despite being unlit, and the trackpad also reasonable. FN key functionality is all there, along with a few USB 3.0 ports with one being USB-C, an HDMI out, audio/mic 3.5mm combo port, and a microSD in slot. No RJ45 network port, but the wireless AC is very powerful with great range and stability for such a small laptop and actually as good if not better than the Intel Centrino 6300 in my other laptop.The build is surprisingly sturdy and high quality, and Windows 10 just works (but you need to disable S mode for your regular apps!). Web browsing and apps like Spotify work fine without too much of a hitch. Sometimes page loading or scrolling can be a bit laggy or buggy but it isn't too much to complain about given the astoundingly low power 6-watt Celeron N4000 CPU. The key to this newer Gemini Lake N4000 is that despite being just a dual-core without hyperthreading, the single-threaded performance is reasonably high given the power restrictions. High enough in fact that I don't really feel limited browsing the web coming from a powerful desktop PC. Videos on YouTube are smooth but Twitch videos may drop occasional frames depending on the extent of background processes, but still as smooth as you'd need. I recommend Edge browser for this laptop because it's smoother than Chrome for me even though I usually prefer Chrome on my other computers. While Edge has improved it's usability nearly up to par with Chrome, it's still buggy on occasion including video artifacts and elements not working or showing properly. Even still it's worth it on this laptop.The CPU is very easy to load to 100% usage so be sure to optimize startup tasks and services if you know how to. CPU cycles are precious in this system. Despite this apparent problem, I can still assure you overall usage doesn't feel slow or obnoxiously limited, just not seamless like a regular system would be.The UHD 600 graphics chip is very low power and much slower than the integrated graphics on Core and Pentium processors, meaning you shouldn't expect playable 3D games like you would with Iris pro graphics or the higher UHD models. UHD 600 is at the very bottom, but still enough for everyday applications. I'm not sure if an external GPU could be ran through the USB-C port, which isn't thunderbolt, so I'm over 90% certain it wouldn't be possible. The CPU is soldered so there's that too.The screen itself is ok. It's supposed to be LED, and viewing angles are average and the color gamut is supposed to be just 45% NTSC. Even still, 1366x768 is a suitable resolution for an 11.6"" screen, and also a resolution often found on $500 laptops with larger 15.6"" screens. You may want to make your own color profile in Windows. Because the laptop is so small, holding it like it's a tablet or tugging it around is extremely easy.The camera works, not above and beyond but ok SD quality. The realtek audio is a bit limited in dynamic range but still pretty usable. The speakers are as expected, not great, but can get pretty loud and aren't awful.At the moment, driver support is badly setup by Asus. Most of the driver packages don't work and/or aren't packaged correctly. For example, the Intel VGA package on Asus's website is missing a lot of the files that are supposed to be there, making it impossible to install the package. Installing from device manager doesn't work. The BIOS update took ages to figure out because you MUST ONLY use a USB drive that is formatted specifically to FAT or FAT32 file system (NOT exFAT) with the BIOS flash utility found in the BIOS which is accessed by holding F2 while booting. This was a major problem for me because many of my USB drives can't be formatted to FAT32 by the built in Windows format utility, but luckily an older drive was already formatted in FAT. WHY the BIOS flash utility only recognizes FAT/FAT32 doesn't compute in my head and is extremely annoying, not to mention that the bottom of the laptop says E203MA but the model is ""secretly"" E203MAS in regards to driver and BIOS updates.Because this particular model is so new, I'll give Asus a chance to fix the problems with driver and BIOS updates. Otherwise, good value for the price. It's surprisingly some of the things it features like a sturdy frame, USB-C and a decent keyboard that Asus could have omitted at this price point but didn't, but seeing that the audio and camera aren't stellar with some other issues like screen quality and driver support being sub-par, plus the fact that the CPU despite being adequate really is relatively weak, it's a fair deal. I honestly wouldn't have paid more than $150 for this laptop anyway, so again it was a fair deal and a good value.",0
"Couple weeks ago I requested to return my Asus G15 Advantage laptop in favor for this one, which is the ASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 with i9-12900h CPU and Nvidia 3070-ti GPU. However, they sent me a used one! I chose to buy the brand new one, but they sent me a used one without its original packaging, etc. The Asus G15 Advantage laptop I got about 3 weeks ago was brand-new in its original, sealed packages with serial codes and everything, etc. I think the Asus Scar here is low on quantity; that’s probably why I got a used one, but even then I shouldn't have paid full price for a used one.Of course, I called Amazon and settled on a discount on the promise that I can't send this one back. However, I still have the full manufacturer's warranty and the 2 years warranty I purchased along with this laptop. I don't know, I like Asus laptops but I don't like getting screwed over. That's the reason for the 3 stars. This laptop runs really well and likely better than the Asus G15 Advantage laptop with the AMD 6800M GPU.",0
"The design and the price for this laptop is awesome, also I trust Amazon to deliver the package from USA to Peru, Amazon collect the import taxes and I receive my package in 4 days! That was really quick. About the product it is very good product for the price I payed!",0

insane hardware for the price paid. great laptop,0

"I would not recommend this laptop due to screen issues. I have seen multiple other reviews/videos with the same issue. The Screen flickers in and out quite frequently.Seems to be because they put the cable up against one of the hinges, as well as other hardware malfunctions that keep occurring.DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP",0
I love this. Works great and is fast for what I need it for.,0
Its good.Not much heavy.Touch screen is perfect.,0
"Excellent notebook, fast, light, the screen has a perfect resolution.",0
"Though this is a light laptop, it still feels heavy in my backpack - I try to avoid bringing it to class.I've had this laptop for about 4 months and so far so good. The only I encountered in that my screen started flashing (it's hard to describe...), but this probably stopped after I completed the regular software update.I really like the colour. I had a mac before this, and though I do miss Garageband, this laptop has been working just as well for me and is much more reasonably priced. I just need to remeber to keep the anti-virus software updated!My cat also loves this laptop - he loves sitting on it and walking across the keyboard. So far, the laptop has survived all cat-related assaults!",0
"I love the build quality, the screen, the keyboard. Ports are ok.I bought this as a mobile workstation and it does the job pretty well. I know not to expect a lot from a tiny laptop, so I don't.So far, my only complaint is that the fan gets REALLY loud under load (during a call when I was not using my headphone mic, my colleagues asked me to turn off the vacuum cleaner).",0
La necesitaba para los estudios en línea de mi niño. Fue recomendada y es excelente equipo.,0
"I play games that demand a lot out of a computer and didn’t have any problems playing any games at medium to high graphics. Pretty nice download speedsSolid for the price, storage is low so I ended up getting an external drive and the fans can be loud but with a head set on you don’t even notice it. I’d recommend this laptop",0
Came packaged really great and its very sleek and fast! I couldn't be happier with the speed of games now :) ! A friend recommended this to me and it is absolutely amazing so far! Love the little features with it too like the shutter for the webcam!,0
"This laptop is really great for everyday regular gamer. It may not be the top of the line but it also doesn't cost you to go broke to buy one. For its price of 1k, it's very fair and offers ton of value. GPU is more than adequate to handle most games. I play Fallout 4 on high graphics and it runs very smooth. It can run RDR 2, GTA, Farcry etc. The Ryzen processor is really powerful and I think it beats intel from analysis video I saw on YouTube. Overall, really great laptop. I don't go hardcore on all the advanced technicalities like overclocking, etc. Just simple gamer who likes good graphics. I recommend Legion 100%",0
Bought it for my son for schoolHe loves it the price was right,0
I hate it.,0
A very nice lightweight laptop that does everything I need it to do at a very affordable price,0
"I am glad it finally came, took longer then advertised for shipping. Came with everything as advertised. No broken seals.",0
This laptop will do everything you need and quickly. It is great for gaming. The colors and response time are top notch. It is thin and light for taking with you wherever you want to game.,0
"Great computer for being a laptop. I bought it to play intensive games like Witcher or Elden Ring and it holds up great. But, like another laptop I bought off amazon, there is a single dead pixel in the middle of the screen that I did not notice until now ( April when I have had the laptop since January) so its a little annoying on that part",0
the keyboard has very good feeling to it,0
"The laptop would not give me anything better than 45Mbps while my phone and another laptop were consistently better than 170 Mbps. Called Dell, spoke to the warranty person. They remoted into my laptop, couldn't fix it but thought it was strange. Connected me to the Dell technician who reminded me I did not take out an extended service warranty and they would assist with technical assistance but only if I pay $200. Spoke to Amazon, got a replacement, same result so it was not a one-off bad wireless card. Returned the replacement got refund. Also, this laptop never recognized my 5G connection either. If slow connection is OK go for this laptop, I have no patience for slow connection when I have high speed wireless.",0
Gift,0
This is not a touchscreen. Otherwise it's great for my 14yr old. He uses it for hw and for playing games...mostly for playing games.,0
"This is the most useless product to call itself a computer I have ever seen. It shouldn't even have been produced. Just a waste of resources and more garbage to pile up. My kids played with $30 computers for children that were faster. I just wish my son had started school and discovered how bad it is before the return window closed. Just one Chrome window tab and it takes 2 minutes to load. Chromebook or Chromepaperweight. Usually I like Samsung. I always buy their phones. Fortunately the school has one to lend him until he gets a real computer. The Lenovo from school actually works, Flex 5, it's not bad.",0
"elegante, buena calidad, en fin a gusto con mi nueva laptop gamer...Asus lo mejor",0
It no longer brings the free year of google drive. pity,0
"It's good for puttering around the internet, if it's plugged in.",0
"I was very pleased with this product and it's performance for the past year. However, I turned it on last night and the screen is black. I see the lights are lit on the keyboard and hear the fan running. I tried to reset the computer by holding down the power button and researched it online. Seems when this occurs the motherboard has died. So I am not happy at the moment and am not sure on the warranty, but would have remained a loyal customer if this didn't happen. I have had it since about a year and one month. Asked for additional support from asus. Nothing. Lost a loyal customer.",0
Was looking for a budget laptop for one of my kids. Is a lightweight device. Run all office and school applications without problem. Fast response when open applications.I just take one star. Battery not so good. Only provide 2 hrs operation unplugged in economy mode.,0
The display blows me away. Plenty of CPU and memory and a large SSD.,0

Charged to 100% upon receipt. Turned it off. Turned it on in the morning and it was down to 43%. Amazon troubleshooting was worthless. Acer support closed on weekends.Amazon will not replace. Refund takes 14 business days.I'll be returning and not buying another computer from Amazon ever again.,0
"First time getting a gaming laptop, regular lower priced laptops are not good gaming platforms, this on the other hand greatly exceeded my expectations.",0
I find this chromebook very freindly to use. My grandson caught on real quickly on how to use it. I just love it. I got mine ater my 17 y old daughter got one and used it for school and she as well loves it. I would forsure recommend people to buy this for it is affordable as well.,0
"The key board uses every color under the rainbow and will alternate between colors. It is fast and it has played anything that I have thrown at it like Red Dead Redemption 2, Red Dead Redemption, STAR WARS Jedi Fallen Order?, Borderlands,2,3, and every game that I have on STEAM plays excellent on this. It does run a little warm. But if you use the cooler boost it cools down but it id load. Right now as typing I'm at 38c 100f. But the fan is silent right now. Let me put on Cooler Boost and see...better 32c 89f. Lets see with a Load.. Cooler boost on... 100f-112f. Frame rates run avg 90-144. These were all set on extreme performance with the MSI Center.",0
Best price I've seen. Daughters very happy.. shipping was very fast,0
Funciona rápida y eficientemente,0
"This was to augment / replace our family Chromebook (another Acer), which had three years' intensive use (~6 hours/day) before starting to go wonky. It's exactly what you expect - a slow-ish Chromebook with a decent screen, and a great value. Absolutely would recommend if you're just browsing or doing light office work on it.",0
"I bought this in lieu of building a gaming pc . This laptop performed well with the current games I play without too many issues. When you first get the laptop you have to go into the Graphic card's setting to allow it to use the GEforce graphics card on your games/applications otherwise it uses the ""main"" GPU which is....bad. It does run hot when playing at higher settings ~80C and the battery life is subpar to put it lightly. Overall decent for the price.",0
excelente equipo,0
"I am not sure if my computer has a problem. I received it less than a month ago. It makes a lot of noise, seems as a airplane. It is not good to read and writting with so much noise. It gaves me headache.The touchscreem does work, the size is good, the weight is good. But the fan noise is very laudy.",0

"I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage). I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly). Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO. Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously. Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in. Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected. I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool. In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is). Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine. I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser. The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.The only cons I see are minor in my opinion. Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store. There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair. For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity. I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs. To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding. For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine ""has NO USB PORTS!!!"", which is patently false. In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector. What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub. USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.All things considered, I really love this machine. The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699. Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.",0
"Dears, thank you, it is amazing laptop ? works exelent.",0
Beautiful piece of tech. BUT MY FAN IS ALWAYS SO LOUD even if I'm just browsing the web. Its so annoying. Didn't notice til after the return date.Edit: Rubber feet got removed 6 months later. What a waste of an expensive laptop.,0
"It’s a standard Mac, there are no bells and whistles. If you’ve owned a Mac of any kind before, there’s nothing new here.It’s about 15% faster than the Intel version, however on some apps it might be slower or exactly the same.The Retina screen sort of works but only on apps that support Retina. Otherwise, it scales back to 1440x900.The build quality is not very good and it’s easy to break.I had mine for 5 days and the keyboard keys stopped working, or work intermittently.Also, it does not use MagSafe, so there’s a possibility you can knock your MacBook Air by tripping on the charging cable.It also doesn’t support USB-A, so you’ll have to buy an adapter.",0
"I've had this for two months and used it in a limited fashion, so take this review for what it's worth.But I did return it.The good:-The graphics are beautiful in games.-The keyboard is delightful to use.-The built in sound is great.The bad:-Fan turns on (a very loud one) when a few tabs are open in a browser. Sometimes when nothing is open.This is supposed to be a very powerful machine...why is the CPU working so hard to be online?-Computer has trouble (read: lags) streaming video at moderate quality. Not a problem if you never care to use Netflix or whatnot, but isn't this supposed to be one of the most capable machines out there right now? And it lags when streaming Netflix??-There is only one HDMI out port. Kind of annoying, but not a big deal I guess.The ugly:Here's the big one and why this is a return:-The laptop I purchased, brand new, has a well-known defect with the trackpad. The trackpad will occasionally stop registering touches. Absolutely unacceptable for any gaming situation, and incredibly frustrating for regular computer use. I ignored it for about a month because I wasn't using the laptop too heavily, and figured it was some firmware thing that I just needed to find a download for.Absolutely incorrect. The defect began occurring about once every 5 minutes and so I researched the fix. There is none. This is at least the second generation of gaming laptop ASUS has released that has this defect, and they don't have a resolution for it: there is no driver or firmware that fixes this, and ASUS does not know why it happens: they will replace the trackpad or replace the entire laptop and hope the issue doesn't come up.That is utterly unacceptable to have in a top of the line machine.-It crashed after running Mount & Blade (Steam game) for an hour. I don't know what to attribute it to, but it was a full crash with no explanation. I have not been running this thing very hard, yet have gotten it to catastrophically crash with no error code. Does not bode well at all for the longevity of the hardware.Summary: Avoid this laptop. It's possible I got a dud, but that trackpad issue being one that ASUS doesn't have a resolution for is unacceptable. It's a shame, because it is a beautiful machine.",0
The laptop chassis itself feels sturdy,0
"The purpose of one tiny accessory was obscure. Otherwise it seems to be everything I've wanted, a lightweight portable device that runs off Verizon where ever Verizon is available. Does not depend on availability of Wifi. Is rugged and study. One can place provided paper over screen and draw, then remove paper and result is on screen.",0
item has failed Need support help,0
"The problem was with the operating system, namely Chrome OS, which seems fine for many, probably those who grew up with Android phones. But for us old-school Microsoft folk it was like Greek, not nearly enough help, unintuitive (at least to us) with all sorts of unexplained symbols that did important things (the Greek!). Plus it wants to send everything to the cloud or Google Drive and with our rural snail’s pace internet connection, that would take FOREVER! So now we’ll try Windows 10 in S mode, which is supposed to make things easier while looking familiar, though, like Google or Apple, everything has to go through Microsoft, for apps, having to use Bing (bye-bye Chrome and Firefox). We’ll see…..(Interestingly you can opt out of the S mode but not opt back in, hmmmmm)",0
"It's a great laptop for high school students. It has a fast processor, clean design, and the flip ability is great for online classes and taking notes. I would buy again.",0
The complete lack of information is my only complaint. The hardware is all that I could hope for,0
"Great laptop. Good trackpad (the sensitivity for right click is a little too broad, but overall good). Keyboard feels nice and works well. Well placed USB ports/other ports. plugging the power into the back is a little stressful if it's on a soft surface like a bed, but has not had any issues in the few weeks I have had it. Runs extremely well and plays any game I want at a decent quality. Good quality monitor makes a big difference for precise high speed games.",0
I am a fan of the steel series keyboard,0
I use the laptop to run Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. This is a very resource intensive game and the laptop can run it at medium to high settings without any issues.,0
It has a small ssd however comes with everything but the drive to increase the storage capacity. If your on the edge get it before the scalpers do.,0
Amazing FPS it runs so beautiful. One down side is smalls storage but makes it fun to buy a bigger ssd and do cool customization,0

"I like the storage, and the screen quality.I do not like the face that it still is not a ""lap"" top so to speak. A laptop had a cd/dvd in it... this does not.... a laptop is compatible with games that have been purchased and downloaded... this Acer is not. So if you have down loads some will not be compatible and you might want to rethink.... other than that.... it is pretty decent.",0
The only thing I don’t like is it’s very sensitive to touch.,0
It’s great I love it I don’t ever wanna lose it,0
"I contacted Amazon about the missing cord, who assisted me to contact HP. I sent them pictures of the sent cord & the office. They again sent me the wrong cord. It's a good thing that I ordered a replacement cord from Amazon or I still couldn't use my laptop.",0
"So far, so good. This is a functional laptop, perfect for work and casual internet browsing. I bought this refurbished and haven't experienced any issues.",0
"This is the first gaming laptop I ever owned, although I have owned about 6 other laptops previously. This is a great gaming platform with just a few cons.First, the Pros: Nice sized display with high resolution and a clear, bright display. Sound is incredible in quality, although the volume is very low. Keyboard is crispy, and the backlight can be dimmed or brightened or turned off. Touchpad is responsive although I prefer to use a wireless mouse instead. WIFI has a good strong signal and connections are quick and reliable. Plenty of ports, and built-in cooler makes this a well rounded player. Upgrades are easy to do, and with 2 NVME slots plus a 2.5 drive slot, you won’t be hurting for storage space. The memory can be upgraded to 32GB if you need it.CONS: just a few, and none are deal breakers for me. The first is the weight. Not sure what it is, but this is no lightweight. It’s hefty!! Second, Acer went for some fancy design with the case that has the corners chopped diagonally. It’s not actually sharp, but it can be a bit pokey if you’re balancing it with one hand on your knee while battling behemoths in Dauntless. That’s pretty much all I could find to say negatively.All in all, this is a great laptop at a reasonable price for the specs. It will definitely stand up to whatever you can dish out in your favorite games.",0
"I like the sharp picture and colors are so vibrant. I watch movies a lot and everything is so crisp and sharp! I would have liked a touchscreen but it’s okay without.. I have a lot to learn, but it’s easy to learn with the many tutorials provided.",0

"I jumped out of the “Ecosystem” a little while back. Last had a MacBook Pro 13” in about 2015 when we had real ports. I realize those days aren’t coming back and it’s #HubLife or #NoLife. But I’ve been underwhelmed with Apples offerings for a minute.When I started reading up and watching vids on the new M1 I was sold. I’m all in now. This Air is an absolute unit of a machine. I really see no reason for anyone to get the Pro, unless you’re getting the soon to be released updated 16” pro. This bad boy will do all that most people need.Let me say first off, the battery life is phenomenal. I can take it on the go and use it all day with no issues at all. I didn’t even pack my charger with me today. I can carry it in a simple sleeve and I’m good to go. Plus it’s lighter than the pro as well.Performance is spectacular. It runs circles around anything else I have that’s windows based. In testing, I’ve seen it surpass or hold its own, against prior MacBook Pro models. Even those with dedicated graphics.For the majority of people, this is going to be their go to laptop. What you get for an entry level Mac is stellar. This is my recommendation for anyone outside of a hardcore video/photo editor. But even then, in a pinch it will get the job done.",0
"Looks very slim, but has quite a bit of weight keeping it very strong and sturdy.",0
"Do yourself a favor and don’t purchase an item like this online. Our computer is defective and it has been a nightmare trying to resolve the issue. The computer arrived close to 2 weeks ago and it has, essentially, been an expensive paper weight. It doesn’t work.

If I had bought the computer from a store, I would have some place to take it in myself. I feel like I’ve been scammed.",0

You do get PredatorSense which is your headquarters for managing status turbo modes, gaming profiles etc. Navigating it is clean and effective:-CPU/GPU/System temps-Lighting controls-CPU/Fan modes-Historical graphs of performance and teams, stuff like that.The case is impressive and cool metal design, somewhat resistant to my fingerprints but the touch pad grabbed all my oils, I found myself polishing that more than the lid. Course you’ll be hooking up a high DPI mouse to um, run those engineering programs.And the keyboard, what a surprise. Full keyboard with num pad with clear definition between keys and a raised feel over competitors.It has the old classic turbo button which cranks up all the fans, quite loud but I recommend setting turbo when in the app mgmt section in PredatorSense.I’m not going back to school but if you need a window rig that can handle all tasks photo, design, gaming… check it out.",0

"The laptop's performance was alright, what was expected given the price of the laptop. But the screen showed issues since I first turned it on, it seemed that it was not plugged in correctly or it had gotten loose from the other components. Screen would go black while the system's online and it would need to be restarted multiple times to fix but even so it would not get fixed sometimes. I would say avoid buying ASUS TUF products, their products will work at first but always show problems on the long run and in some cases in the short run as well.",0

The laptop consistently acts as though wifi does not exist and I am constantly forced to restart the laptop just to get it to recognize local wifi connections.Yesterday, no amount of restarts worked, and the wifi hub in the lower right completely vanished. I ended up having to completely factory reset the computer just to get the wifi drivers back working. Do NOT bother buying this piece of broken machinery. Sending mines back.",0
"This model number, 81JW0001US, does not have a FHD (1920x1080) screen. The resolution of this model number, 81JW0001US, is HD (1366x768) which is absolutely awful for a 14"" screen.Lenovo does offer a chromebook S330 with FHD (1920x1080) resolution -- that model is the 81JW000EUS and is listed on their website for $279.99 as of 6/12/2019.It does not look like the FHD model (which also comes with 64GB of storage, not the 32GB listed here) is currently available on Amazon.All the above being said, if you know for a fact that you will not be bothered by the low resolution of the screen, this is actually a pretty good buy for the price. Lenovo lists their HD (1366x768) S330 for $249.99.

Ive had it for about a month. I was tryibg to find a decent laptop for around 400$ that i would be able to work off and stay mobile with. It does everything I need to run my buisness and has pretty good battary life. One thing I really like is how fast it boots up it comes on in seconds and loads programs fast. Browsing speed is really good too and im able to multitask without slowdowns. The screen is good but is subject to glare pretty easily at times. Touchpad is solid as well as the keyboard. Its not incredible in any department but if youre looking for something that can keep up with a fast paced lifestyle it works great. A solid laptop at a great price point. 7/10 in my book.,0
Use this laptop for work-no touchscreen-speed and battery life exceed my needs-ACER brand has not let me down yet and this is my 3rd one-definitely recommend the brand,0
Very nice product.. durable.. nice screen. Over all Very happy with it.,0
I just got it and hadn't had the time to play around with it. For the price it appears to be a good deal.,0
So far the battery life seems way too short. Maybe I have to tweek some settings or contact customer support.,0
"This laptop is good, the screen looks good, the material and keyboard feels good, the fans are not that noisy, but on turbo they will sound like an airplane.The hardware is great, with a really fast SSD (compared to my previous laptop MSI GE63 8RE), fast 11th gen Intel CPU (that doesn't run hot like hell, unlike gen 8th, I could fry some eggs with my old laptop). The ram is good for gaming, but I will have to upgrade to 32 GB becuase I also develop software.The cons:- AORUS Control Center app is horrible, every time I turn on the computer, it forgets the previous AI mode it was before (Turbo or Gaming or Creator). And also it forgets the mode I leaved my RGB keyboard (static). It's really annoying.- The app doesn't show the current temperature of the CPU and GPU, only the load in percentage.- Camera is in the bottom, so when you are in a videocall, people will see your nostrils.",0
the fans get very loud when playing games.,0
"I bought this laptop in March of 2018. Within 3 weeks, the HDMI port failed, within 5 months, the fan controller failed so that they run full speed all the time. Tech support was of little or no use at all and only recommended sending in the unit for repair. Repair is a minimum of 10 days turnaround. I would strongly recommend nobody buy ASUS as their quality seems to have failed.",0
"I think its a pretty good idea to keep the camera separate from the laptop, it allows for a high quality camera and audio.",0
"Almost everything is top-notch: Performance, battery life, new magic keyboard, usual unparalleled trackpad, quality of materials and build. I was a little concerned about lower screen brightness of MB Air versus MB Pro prior to purchase, but have no complaints. Only feature less than excellent is camera, which is only 720p. Limited ports only a minor inconvenience. Most highly recommended.",0
The feet on the bottom of the laptop are a plastic like material that is prone to sliding,0
"Best bang for your buck. Unit boots up in SECONDS. Screen is really nice, very pleasant for gaming and editing media. Battery life is approximately 3 hours IF you’re just browsing the internet, using light apps, streaming video, etc. My only gripe is that I assumed the 8750H would be more powerful (it’s not bad by any means, just expected better) but i can run most games at high-ultra and get some serious frames as this is the full 1060 6gb and not the max Q version. No frame-drop issues so far but i usually use the fan controller program that’s preinstalled and keep it on max as this unit does get pretty warm (it’s a gaming laptop, duh?). Acer hit the mark with this one. if you have $1100 laying around and want to get a solid gaming laptop, I highly recommend it.",0
this new Zenbook is fast,0
"When you hit the function key, the function keys light up which is a cool touch.",0
"With the11.6"" diagonal screen it seem much smaller than my standard laptop, but it is lightweight and has good image clarity...Still learning Chrome software which seems simpler than Microsoft..Just wanted a unit that was basic and easy to operate...",0
the keyboard lights are nice,0
"What the title says. It's great for gaming if you want this laptop to never last then go ahead let it push and die in a year. I played games like hell let loose, halo infinite, elden ring, assassin's creed valhalla and also do a lot of rendering work and while it's normal for these games to get these laptops hot, this thing went up to 90c to 100c hot. This is with a cooling pad, and the fan running at turbo and some how managed to hit tjmax. The build is decent and has seen some abuse such as accidentally dropping it a few times and never noticing any substantial drop in performance. On the other hand, too bad it'll drop in performance anyways when the interior gets so hot that it needs turbo on all the time as the cpu gets so hot that it lowers the clock speed to save itself. Also, The predator button is the stupidest design choice i've ever seen and the program itself manages to take 20% of cpu load and make the laptop hotter by having the program running by itself. I don't care if I can change the predator button's settings, as having it where the num lock is annoying and shows how much acer cared about keyboard design when they first made this.Also installing ssd wasn't bad, but the tutorials are much like acer's monitor quality: bad. Didn't show me where to stick the slim thing to open up the laptop so i can install another ssd in there.For what it's worth and almost a year with this thing and I have a lot of resentment with this laptop, and that i'll use it until it dies and then go elsewhere.UPDATE: Oh yeah I forgot about about the overly sensitive mousepad. It's so bad that they thought adding the FN + f2 key would fix an obvious awful design issue that they think a bandage will prevent frustrations. If I Have to press fn + f2 key every time I had to switch from gaming to internet surfing to gaming then why should I even bother buying a laptop to begin with? That thing is neck deep almsot near the space bar that it gets in the way of communication. Meanwhile so many other laptops with similar designs such as small arrow keys to knowing where to place their mouse pad so when you place your hand on wasd, it shouldn't result in an accidental discharge in CS:GO and give away your position.",0
Se apaga y se friza el monitor. Es muy lenta y se toma mucho tiempo para entender.,0
"When I started thinking about buying a light and powerful affordable laptop, the only option was the 2021 TUF Dash, but it had a 4-core bottleneck CPU. Later, the 2022 version was released. This model has a good 10-core i7-12650H CPU (6 P-cores + 4 E-cores) and 105W RTX 3060 GPU (80+25 Dynamic boost), so I bought it as soon as I got the chance.It works with heavy applications without any problems, the system is fast and responsive. The gaming performance is excellent, I played Detroit: Become Human with great pleasure on the highest graphics settings.If you want a model with a higher TDP GPU, consider the Asus TUF F15 2022 (not Dash), this model has a 140W RTX 3060 (115+25 Dynamic boost), but it is heavier and larger, so decide what is more important to you. I chose portability.*Asus is offering 90-day warranty extension for this review.",0
"The 13” laptop comes with a nice luxurious packaging design which is very easy and cool to unbox. First impressions, the build quality from the aluminum covering on the outside to the carbon fiber composite on the inside gives the laptop an overall premium look and feel.The speakers sound quality and clarity are not bad for a laptop this small. The keyboard is quiet, a little clicky but has a nice balanced pressure and was comfortable to type on.My Specs:-Intel Core i7-1195G7-16GB LPDDR4x RAM-512GB SSD-FHD+ Touchscreen-Intel Iris Xe Graphics-Windows 11 ProThe FHD+ 1200p choice provides quite high enough pixel density for such a small display size and I believe it also helps with battery life more than with the optional 4k UHD+ display. This screen size gives an overall 16:10 aspect ratio providing more vertical space for more efficient work. The panel is non-reflective one, IPS equivalent “wide viewing angle” that has an efficient brightness level and is good for outdoor activities. Contrast and colors are very accurate. The screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz.The power adaptor supports input voltage 110 – 240 which means it is universal and supports different types of electric volts worldwide.This 11th Gen Dell laptop offers the ability to upgrade your SSD for up to 2 TB. I had 408 GB storage free out of the box. I did the SSD storage speed benchmark test (2 runs) using Crystaldiskmark 8.0.4. Results were around 2-2.5 Gbps for both read and write. These numbers are quite fast and you might not easily find a faster device, storage wise.*My total all core render Cinebench R23 score is: 1ST pass: 3301 / 2nd pass: 3804 (average for this specific processor).*3D Mark Score: 1240 (lower part of the curve among gaming laptops scores).In short, this is a great business level laptop from Dell that I will choose for some color photography work and productivity. For more professional color-sensitive photography work, I’d definitely recommend the 4k or 3.5k optional upgrades. But, if you are a battery nerd like me, you may want to sacrifice some higher resolutions for a better overall battery life.Recommendations?Camera quality can be improved and it’ll be also great to see a camera shutter available in the future.",0
Really good laptop.,0
"Wow, I really love this Chromebook. I was searching so long for a good one after purchasing a regular laptop and failing with that purchase during a Black Friday sale. This Chromebook has everything I need, and I love the look and feel of it. High quality, good keyboard, fast response. Easy for me to carry around in my bag when I'm running around town and I'm small. Very happy customer.",0
Nice laptop. I got the I9 32gb 1tb ssd with nividia 70. One thing I had assumed (dummy me) was that the key board had a number pad ... it didn't. I can get an external later. Must have been made early in the year ... was a lot of driver updates. The My Dell support assist won't load ... keeps telling me to try again later! I bought it for use with blender rendering and I think it's going to be perfect once I get an external number pad. Ordered on Sunday and got Tuesday afternoon. It was packaged good!,0
"Good value,I use it for music productionJust get a 16Gb memory for a better experience.",0
"Yes, so much I'm thinking seriously about getting another.....",0
"This computer is great! I bought it for some heavy duty college work and I have to say I am impressed. The Air is usually meant for low maintenance tasks like watching videos, Facebook, the web and school work but I find myself doing MacBook Pro work on it with no trouble at all. MacBook Air doesn't have fans so I expected it to run slower than my Pro but it runs about the same and crushes any editing tasks that I throw at it. Its a small powerhouse compared to its Pro versions and continues to get the job done.",0
"Awesomeness, now that I got it to update and everything, including apps, works! I 💘 love this machine!",0
The larger touch pad is a nice addition and allows easier movement across the screen without having to lift your finger and start again,0
This is a great computer. It comes loaded with Killer. Crazy fast. It came packaged correctly so that it was not damaged. I have had trouble with this in the past when ordering electronics online. Believe the reviews and the hype.,0
It is worth for the quality and durability.,0
Bought this at request for my grandson for his graduation. He is extremely involved with gaming and was pumped to say the least when he received it. He was also appreciating everything else it could do for him relevant to his continuing education. It was a Win Win!,0
"I am very disappointed in ASUS customer service. The camera never worked in my computer and to fix it I need to send it in for 10+ days and pay my own shipping. For a computer this high end they should offer better support. Better yet, they should test the equipment and make sure it works.",0
The back panel u unscrews and comes off for easy access unlike many other laptops.,0
"For an 800$ laptop I was extremely disappointed on how terrible it was. I unpacked it, set it up and I already run into a problem where it has to trouble shoot and reset, it takes about an hour but after that it started to work and I didn’t think much of it. When I install the games I want to play I realize that this laptop was extremely pathetic. I get on Minecraft with optifine and I get a maximum of 20 FPS, now if that’s not bad enough I get on geometry dash and I can’t even play the game without it freezing every few seconds. Then after a week of having the laptop it crashes and I can’t even log back on. I’ve trouble shooter for 3 days now and not a singular piece of luck. My old used laptop that was 400$ ran faster and longer than this 800$ GAMING laptop. Please, if you want to buy a good gaming computer, get a pc.",0
What great computer for my 5 year old grandaughter!! Light weight too!,0
"Second MSI I have purchased. I am a true believer in these machines. Well built, well priced, and a monster at gaming. Benchmarks very will, not even just as a laptop. but a PC.",0
"For its price, the laptop is worth every penny. I was able to work remotely on it while on vacation with no hiccups. The only small critique would be it’s battery life, which falls short of expectations. However, this could be just a matter of the remote server I have to use. For my fellow on-the-go employees, this laptop is great.",0
So far we love it! Great for college work everyday uses.,0
Perfect as expected. Thank you.,0
Very surprised at the quality of this computer.,0
The battery can stay alive up to 7 hours depends on how you doing with it.,0
"Enjoy my games, picture is nice, long lasting battery",0
"the bluetooth has is stopped two times working after 5 or 6 hours of use, it appears ""Unknown device (code 43)"" on the device manager. Looks like the module is afected by the heat, because it works again when I turn off the laptop and wait around for an hour. That's too bad, means a direct hardware problem.",0
Great price for this MacBook. This replaced an old HP laptop. It’s easy to navigate. Small and compact for carrying around if needed.,0
"I first want to start by saying that this was my first laptop purchase for personal/work use in about 5 years, so a lot in terms of CPU performance has changed since Intel 4th gens. Anyway, on to the review. This is a great laptop, the one I purchased had the 256GB SSD with Win 10 installed on it. Super fast boot speeds even from a cold boot. Upon using it I had read in the reviews here on Amazon that some drivers may need updating to get them to work properly. Sure enough my backlit keyboard was having trouble getting going and the touchpad, wireless NIC, and audio needed driver updates as well. No big deal, just head to the Asus support site and look up this model of Vivobook. After using it for about 2 weeks now, I have only one gripe about this specific model (I don't know if the others have this issue too) it's with the Caps lock key. There's no LED light or on screen notification when you hit it. I was stunned there wasn't something built into Asus's framework that would make up for this, but I guess not. A way that made it not as bad was going to accessibility under keyboard settings and enabling sounds when special keys are hit like Num lock and caps lock. Now it's not that big of a deal in the grand image of the laptop but still an annoying object to deal with. It shouldn't detract you from purchasing this too that's why I'm leaving it at 5 starts.Pros:. Nice backlit keyboard. Backlit LED screen 1920x1080 clear quality. Keyboard is fine to me (others said there's give but I am coming from a Lenovo flex 2 that had way worse bend and got used to it). Battery life holds up maybe not 8 hours but about 5-6 with decent use (I'm never far from an outlet anyway). Fingerprint sensor is awesome! One of the best features in my opinion. Little bloatware, get rid of McCaffe ASAP (Avira, Avast, ESET, Bitdefender) I'd even say Norton just put something else on for security. Room for expansion, has a M.2 SSD slot taken up and room for another 2.5' storage piece (just got a 1TB SSD for data recently to take advantage of this). 8GB of RAM is more than enough for what I want in this laptop but you can expand up to 16GB if you want to I supposeCons:Disassembly is tedious, looks up a guide before you start prying at the back panelOther than that good luck, it's an awesome work laptop and should be reviewed as such.",0
"My laptop overheated within 2 days & laptop wouldn’t turn on, i believe it was the battery. Luckily I can return for another one, hopefully the same issue doesn’t happen again.",0
Good quality! I always buy hp computers!,0
NO WORDS,0
"Great except that it isn't compatible with important apps/software like any Microsoft, Signal Messenger... everything is great, but anything that can't let me use Microsoft Office is a no go for me. If I knew, I would have never gotten it.",0
Complete POS! Not even a year old of very little use and it will not charge!! Junk!!,0
"The laptop is really well-built, fast and simple perfect for work, study and gaming, the only thing to have in mind if that you are heavily gaming it can get hot, so I would recommend a cooling base/stand, but this is a great laptop for the price !",0
"Great laptop, a nice, clean, modern design and the screen is really nice. It's very quick to boot. Love the fingerprint sensor and new Lenovo touchpad features too. Speakers are fine for a mid range laptop, nothing special but still perfectly fine. Plenty of modern features for a laptop in this price range too",0
"This computer is amazing, very reliable. Its not heavy at all, which was an important feature for me because I use it for college. I don't think I'll ever buy another brand.",0
"I just received my Strix Scar II with an RTX 2070... fortunately, I've not seen any of the BSOD horror stories I see in the low star reviews here. I'll update after more time has passed.Overall the machine is pretty nice, and gaming is nearly as fast as on my desktop, but the pretty severe back-light bleed, and the clunky ASUS software (especially the keyboard RGB) leave me a bit underwhelmed by this laptop at the $2200 I paid for it in Feb 2019. That said, it is one of the less expensive options with this hardware config, and perhaps these compromises are what let them hit that price point.Pros:- great gaming frame-rate, decent screen, very responsive.... this thing feels nearly as fast as my 1080 Ti desktop.- reasonably slim and durable form factor- lots of USB-A ports (which I need)- BIOS has a setting to disable the annoying ROG brand POST graphic sound.- the membrane keyboard feels decent and is VERY quiet.Cons:- there is pretty massive screen backlight bleed in the corners (FHD 144hz 3ms screen)... it doesn't really affect functionality, but in a $2200 laptop i expect better- The power button LED is blaring super bright red... I'm going to need to black-marker it or something- fans run loudly at odd times when the laptop is not doing anything intensive .... they calm down, but I don't care for the way the laptop feels like it's a jet taking off just because I powered it on- software-preload came in an abysmal state. drivers were old, on a laptop that was *just* released in the last few weeks. audio was popping. unclear how to update ASUS software. I finally removed some of it, updated some of it, and got it sorted. Audio seems fine now.- setting up keyboard RGB was confusing. I couldn't find the right tool, so I installed ""ROG AURA"" from their website, but this was the wrong tool, laptops need ""ROG AURA Core""... after installing this I was able to separately configure the 4-keyboard-regions, light-bar, and back-of-screen logo like I wanted.- the keyboard layout is a bit weird, especially the arrow keys..- the camera is not only in the lower right of the screen, but it's not angled up, so to actually get my face in frame, I have to tilt the screen uncomfortably far back... i suppose it's better than no webcam, but it's not reasonable for regular use. Fortunately i don't use that much on a laptop.- there is no hardware keyboard remapping tool... something that's pretty important for gaming. I used SharpKeys to do windows registry remapping (capslock->control), but this doesn't work properly with League of Legends for some reason... on my desktop I use a gaming keyboard with a remapping driver and it works great.",0
"you can browse the internet and thats about all the machine is good for. 🤷🏼‍♀️ not gona work for me- i take and edit a lot of photos, download music etc.",0
"Computer works great overall but now I see dead lines on me screen. Computer does not travel at all, im very disappointed with spending close to $1500.",0
My son uses it for all his gaming the value is Awesome and fair,0
Good. Same price as best buy.,0
"This is my first chromebook and I really, really like it. i am not technologically savvy, and it was very easy to set up and use right away. It is compact and lightweight and charges quickly. The only drawback for me so far is the smaller screen, which is no fault of the product. I should have done a bit more research before purchasing. Overall, very pleased with it and would make a great computer for a student or someone who travels.",0
Arrived faster then expected and was easy to set up which is saying a lot for me bc I’m not tech savvy at all! My son wanted a MacBook for college and now I want one too,0
"Llego en tiempo y forma, ultra silenciosa y potente para el home office. Me gusta que tenga teclado numerico a un lado, por lo que es super comodo. Recomendado",0
Good for college,0
It arrived with a split in the wire loom that exposes the wires running through the cord.,0
Everything runs so well and the design is so sleek,0
It was very accurate and really just worked like it should.,0
"I like my new HP Chromebook 14-ak050nr quite a lot. Yes, it has all the limitations of chromebooks with respect to its own unique operating system, but those limitations are well known. What it does have is a beautiful display with a matt finish, an attractively-styled exterior appearance, good internals, pleasant-sounding speakers, an array of well-positioned ports, and a nice keyboard and trackpad. Taking into account what it offers compared to the competition and its price on Amazon, I think that it is an excellent choice for anyone in the market for a new chromebook. It is the first chromebook that I have ever owned, so I don't have another to compare it with, but I am pleased with my choice and enjoy using the machine. I have never yet called Tech Support at HP, so I can't be of much guidance there as to how helpful they may be in the future in the event of issues that may arise. I am hoping that they are there for us when we need them.",0
"Most that I expected, a great laptop for a great price!!!",0
"Game changer! Literally! Been a console owner all my life. Hard to adjust to keyboard but Mann the 144hz screen, you will never touch a console game again because you will be spoiled to the graphics! PC buddies are jealous how much you get for this price.",0
Works very well. No problems!,0
"Es un laptop muy cara tiene problemas para la regulación de brillo de la pantalla, es muy complicado poderte poner en contacto con el proveedor y aún cuando solicitas la factura en repetidas ocasiones te mandan el mismo formulario de lo cual llenas pero nunca te mandan la factura, yo no recomiendo este producto.",0
Bought this for 10 year old Granddaughter. Uses Chrome Book at school. She immediately started showing me all she could do. This is a great smaller notebook for her use.,0
"I got this computer because I wanted an affordable pc after years of macs and hating their keyboard. A couple things I have notice about this computer…Keyboard and pad are nice, good travel on the keyboard but it does not light up when in the dark. And to right click on the track pad still confuses me.Screen is nice and large but seems a little dim on its brightest setting.Computer is a little flimsy when folding/unfolding.Windows 11 I am actually pretty happy with. Takes a little getting used to but I like the os.Overall good buy for what you are spending on it but not fancy. You get what you pay for but I am satisfied for what I need it for.",0
This thing never dies!! Powerful enough for any student,0
"If you want to beat your head with a mallet, choose this laptop over it. I haul a storage drive, battery, and what not to make sure I play one game. I look like a lunatic the amount it takes to do a simple task on this thing. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more",0
Lo mejor,0
Screen quality is TERRIBLE! I hate this computer.,0
"gap near web cam left size is bigger than the right side, mouse in certain parts looks lower",0
"I just recently got this laptop, and it was really easy to set up! I got this laptop for school and to watch Netflix,hulu,etc. It works really well with Google classroom and all of the other Google things, but with Netflix the screen quality wasnt the best, but that doesn't really matter to me. Overall the laptop is really easy to use and I think that for how much it costed it was worth it😁",0
"The screen is amazing, the keyboard comfortable",0
so far so good. the speed and everything on this laptop is good.,0
"great for surfing the web, doing homework, and similar tasks. Certainly not a gaming PC, but definitely a good buy if used properly",0
"I've only had this for 2 years, and it constantly crashes randomly and gives me the blue screen of death. The chasis is not durable and the screen WILL flex if put in a backpack with textbooks. The thermals are terrible; it gets very hot when I place my finger on the metal right above the processors, and I suspect poor thermals are partially why this laptop randomly crashes. Even if it's not super hot, it still crashes due to kernel errors, unexpected store exception, etc. (which are given when I get the blue crash screen).",0
"Desde que la recibí y hasta ahora me ha funcionado perfectamente. Muy buen desempeño. Enciende en solo 4 segundos y tiene muy buen sonido. Le tengo habilitado el modo para extender el tiempo de vida de la bateria con el que carga solo hasta 79% y con ello puedo trabajar hasta 2 horas con office utilizando un brillo de pantalla de 40%. No he probado hasta ahora cuanto tiempo me puede durar una carga del 100% pero le estimo aproximadamente de 2.5 a 3 horas con un plan equilibrado. Me ha funcionado muy bien con programas de cálculo y diseño CAD. Es la primera vez que compro la marca ASUS, por lo que espero no me decepcione.Como punto malo es el espacio limitado de almacenamiento por lo que es necesario instalar una segunda unidad de disco duro para poder disponer de ello. Lo bueno es que si cuenta con el puerto de conexión SATA para unidades de disco duro convencionales o de estado sólido según se prefiera. Solo que la unidad deberá ser slim (de los modelos más delgados) puesto que el espacio es reducido.",0
"this is quite a laptop. we've never owned a gaming laptop before, but we've had several gaming PC's over the years, but this was the first gaming laptop we've owned. It's been quite the experience.First and foremost this this is heavy. If you actually are using this while sitting down on the couch, it leaves deep indents in my legs when i sit down with it. On top of that it gets ridiculously hot, really fast. even just browsing around on the internet this thing heats up really quickly. i ended up getting a cooling dock i could put this on when i was sitting with it, but that just made it even more heavy, and the dock didn't do much to alleviate the heat emanating from this thing.This thing also has a Huge power brick. My older dell laptops back in the day had this tiny little power brick, this thing is massive. I get that it must be to power this type of laptop, but sheesh, it takes up a bit of space.I will say it runs really quietly. I was surprised by how quiet it was with how hot this gets. i figured the harder it was working, it would be louder, but it's surprisingly quiet.Now to the gaming aspect. It will run games on the highest settings, and run them well. I had this at one point hooked up to my tv in the living room, so i could play Horizon on steam. It ran this game like a champ. the picture quality on it was amazing. We've played WOW on this and it's run at over 120 fps in the larger cities with a bunch of other characters around. overall playing games on this has been amazing. it really does handle gaming well.it has connection points for 4 USB, 2 Monitors, ethernet, audio jack, and SD card.I think one of my other complaints is how quickly this thing will die on you if not plugged in. the battery gets drained rather quickly, even if all you're doing is browsing on the internet.so overall i would say, that this is a fairly solid laptop, with a few minor issues. we got this for gaming, and for gaming it's great. portability is a bit much with how heavy this thing is, and battery life could be better. but overall, i would recommend this.",0
High quality,0
I got the blue screen of death,0
"The processor mentioned by the seller is 4.6 GHzbut when i get the laptop.. its only 1.80GHz 2.30 CHz, disappointed :(Paid for so high price but eventually get low specBattery life is not long as shown in the advertisement ~ 17.5 hours.. that is impossible that longi just use about 5 hours already almost finish battery",0

"TLDR: Hinge broke. Would not buy another (third) one.The photo is not the item I purchased from Amazon. I went into Best Buy looking for a Chromebook that could run Linux Apps and got this Samsung Chromebook. I loved it so much, I bought another, identical one from Amazon for my wife. The one from Amazon still works wonderfully (crosses fingers). I replaced my much loved Samsung with an Asus C434. It doesn't have some of the features; only 1920x1080 vs 1900x1200 which I had liked. No built in stylus. However, none of that really matters if it is going to disintegrate in a few months. Yes, I know, this really should be a one star review.",0
Red backlit keys are a cool feature.,0
"Pros:? Latest 12th Gen Intel Core i7 processor is fast enough for gaming and other computing activities.? RTX 3070 GPU is the graphic card you want inside a gaming laptop.? 144Hz FHD display – make sure you change that in your display settings.? Cooling on this laptop is quiet and does the job.Con:? Battery life is average but I usually plug in when game extensively.My Three Cents:This is one of many gaming laptops I own and will probably take on the road or on a business trip. It’s light and not bulky but still provides a powerful gaming experience. If you’re looking for something compared to a mid-range desktop, this is probably the closest gaming laptop to get.",0
"For the price and the specs, you would expect LG to properly check that all of the components work as expected. Well I can tell you from first hand experience that it seems like they don't. The laptop is light, and when the battery has charge, it does work as expected, but unfortunately the battery does not keep a charge, and after the battery ran out, that was it for the laptop. Shame on LG for not doing their work right. I guess I won't be buying LG ever again.",0

I knew what specs I wanted and what I was willing to pay...even if there was a trade off between specs and affordability.I also read and watched umpteen rated reviews and based on those reviews and while there are MANY gaming laptops out there, I decided on purchasing the Acer Predator Helios 300.The specs on this bad boy are excellent and fitted my requirements, everything works as it should, meaning that I have no issues with performance with hardware or software.Below are, in my opinion, pros and cons of this laptop -PROS -Price - $1183.00 (at the time of purchase) Value for money!!CPU speed is lightening - i7 Octa-core Intel ProcessorWindows 10 - Free upgrade to Windows 11Dedicated GPU - nVidia GeForce RTX 3060RAM - 16gigs DDR4HD - 512GB SSDBattery - 58WattsBuild Quality - Alluminum cover and keyboard chassis - ExcellentWiFi capability - IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/axLAN - Gigabit EthernetBluetooth 5.1Webcam - 720PPorts - USB Type-C port: USB 3.2 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps), DisplayPort over USB-C, Thunderbolt 4, USB charging 5 V; 3 AScreen - 15.6"" FHDRefresh Rate - 144HzUpgradeable - Extra 1 SSD & 1 HD slot availableRBG Keyboard with 4 zone lightingPredator Sense Software is greatTurbo Boost ButtonNumber Pad at the sideAlexa built-inCONS -Weight - 5.1 LBSFingerprint Reader - NoSD Card Reader - NoTouchscreen - NoBuild - Bottom of laptop has a plastic coverSome BloatwareMost importantly - Battery Life - Horrendous (I got about 2 hrs with light computing)Like I stated, I was willing to make compromises/trade offs on what was important to me in purchasing this laptop. I knew that I needed/wanted a fast CPU and a dedicated GPU, with at least 16gigs of RAM, great quality build with a decent enough gamut range for my video/gaming requirements.My trade off are with the battery life and SD Card Reader. Most gaming laptops are NOT noted for good battery life, as the power that's required to push the CPU, GPU and the screen's refresh rate, well, the battery is going to suffer. With that in mind, I knew that portability wasn't going to be an issue, as I would rearly use the laptop on battery power....as the laptop will be connected to the power supply (230W AC power adapter), so that really didn't impact my decision. For the SD Card reader, well, that did, as my drone uses a Micro SD card, but since there's the Thunderbolt 4 port that comes with the laptop, I would just purchase a card reader and connect it to the port and that too would be solved.Overall, this laptop is powerful, the specs proves that, but again...everyone's requirements are different from person to person, so do your research and make a decision that suits YOUR NEEDS as this suited mine.Hope this information helps and thanks for reading my review.Note - Now I have to find a way to get the Acer Predator Helios 300 away from my daughter...lol...she's the REAL gamer in the family.",0
"I absolutely love this laptop but I has one problem that is nearly a deal breaker. The screen has these green zones where the plastic bezel is putting a small amount of pressure on the screen because of a wire or something I assume. It's not noticeable during normal use, but when you have a dark scene in a game or movie, you can really tell.",0
"Its the perfect budget laptop for gamers, the only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have bigger ram but you get what you pay for right?, but thats just personal opinion.It plays ram intensive games on high settings, I can run doom eternal on medium settings, it won't run certain Triple A games such as Battlefront 2, or Skyrim on Ultra but for a little less graphics usage its pretty damn good 👍The Screen is also pretty nice as well, no screen burn issues, and its color definition is great for drawing too for any digital artists use.",0
Great price and quality product.,0
"Estaba buscando una laptop para un familiar que comienza sus estudios, sin embargo actualmente todos los equipos electrónicos están a unos precios altísimos, y los pocos que se encuentran por debajo de los $10,000 MXN son equipos de muy bajo rendimiento como procesadores Celeron y HDD, este equipó sin embargo es la excepción con componentes de mas alto rendimiento como lo es el hecho de traer incluido SDD y un procesador I3.Yo utilice el equipo para realizar las instalaciones de programas básicas correspondiente y estoy satisfecho con el rendimiento que mostro, así como la velocidad de encendido.Recomiendo totalmente juntar un poco mas de dinero e ir por un equipo como este en vez de un equipo con Celeron.",0
"This machine for the price is amazing , yes some components are under clocked and ya it can reach some pretty high temperatures but what your getting for the 2 pcie and a extra sata bay is a lot! There’s a lot of bloat ware but nothing some debloating programs to fix. The screen is becoming unreadable",0
It has a problem with internet connections and going dead all the time. I would give it no Stars,0
Great package laptop. Battery life is not that great but that is to be expected for a gaming system. I would recommend for someone looking for an entry gaming or work station system.,0
"This is a great laptop for a very good price, totally recommended, the only thing unexpected was the RAM sticks (nowhere says it has 2x8GB) so I assumed it had 1x16GB and got another 1x16 to expand",0
Some problems with operation. Stopped for no reason and wouldn't restart. After a few hours it did. But unreliability seemed inappropriate for such an expensive computer. Returned it.,0
Items showed up on time and as promised. All 5 machines functioned as designed. Very good experience so far.,0
The AC adapter cable is too short,0
It’s op,0
this version is bestseller!!!!,0
No complaints.,0
"This is a gaming laptop so don't be expecting 12 hr long battery life if you're doing things like gaming, 3d modeling, etc. I love the customizable keyboard and matte feel. The only con is 500GB storage is probably not enough unless you're constantly cleaning out storage and using an external hard drive, you can also put in your own ssd but the warranty will most likely be invalid if you do that so i suggest doing that after the warranty expires.",0
"I liked it except for the fact that it was not 1440 resolution. I play games at 4k with Dolby Vision at times. Dropping down to 1080 with Dolby Vision I just couldn't do. Especially since I thought I was getting 1440 which is basically 2k. I could have dealt with that. Everything else was great. Unfortunately, I had to return it for that reason.",0
Great for price 👍🏻,0
"This longtime Dell customer is very disappointed by this product. My XPS 13 runs hot even under moderate usage, and the motherboard makes a hissing noise while plugged in. Even though I basically never move my laptop and use it gently, after less than 2 years of usage this laptop experienced major electrical problems. Dell took 6 weeks to repair (much longer than promised) and return my laptop, costing almost $400 (also higher than promised), and replacing seemingly half the system including the motherboard, battery, screen, speaker and more. Customer support didn't provide me with timely and accurate estimates of repair status and repair time. They failed to call when they said they would and instead called late in the evening. I generally found technical support unfriendly, unskilled, and unable to make things right.It just isn't worth the aggravation. Maybe buy an Lenovo or HP instead, as they seem to have better reliability according to LaptopMag.",0
"Description says Silver, got Rose Gold some how. Was absolutely new however. the screen has 6 bubbles that only I will notice on the bottom left of screen. Laptop is blazing fast, super tiny and light and absolutely amazing. Wish it were silver and wish it had 16gb ram. But for the price I will deal with it and slap on a decal on the top and be happy with it. Yes it will do video editing, just will take some time to render 4k. I haven't experienced any choppiness when editing which is a huge difference from my Gen1 i5 desktop. Hope this lasts the 10 years my desktop lasted.",0
I bought this for my husband. At the time I didn't realize it was re-furbished. I think the price I paid for this was as much as a brand new PC. I only realized it was re-furbished after I looked at the receipt. I bought it as a gift for father's day.Not wanting the hassle of sending it back we kept it and I have to say it is working well. It's kind of big and clunky like the older model PC's I guess that's what happens when you shop late at night and don't pay attention. So far so good my husband likes it let's hope it holds out,0
"After a couple months of use by my teenagers, the laptop seems to be holding up very well. It is responsive enough with Windows 11 for basic schoolwork or web browsing. Like the screen size and resolution. I initially had a concern that the laptop was not charging properly, but using the battery controller reset on the bottom seems to have solved the problem, it has been working well for several months now.",0
Would be a good computer but mine came with bad ram. It was blue screen of deathing all day until finally I ran a ram test and it came back saying there was a hardware issue. What a waste of time,0
This laptop has been amazing to game with. It handles everything I throw at it on the highest setting. The laptop handles well both plugged in and unplugged with the only drawback being the amount of noise the fan might produce. The noise has not been an issue as I only use headphones but others in the room will definitely notice. The RGB illuminated keys are nice and the built in software to customize the colors and bindings are a great addition too. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking at this price range.,0
"Lo que más me agrada de la laptop es la calidad del ensamble y lo rápido que corren los juegos. Mi hijo instaló el simulador de vuelo de Microsoft y funciona de maravilla. Los únicos contras de la laptop son: i) duración de la batería y ii) peso del equipo y del cargador. Este último parece un ladrillo, literalmente.",0
"So far this has been a nice laptop, easy to set up, and runs pretty quick. I like the fact that it comes with the newer wi-fi 6 ax adaper. Games run well, with overall useable framerates. No surprises, it's not a top-end machine, so it won't run the newest AAA games on the 'Ultra' settings, but at the MSRP price (or below in my case), it's a good deal for the overall package. I suggest buying an additional 8GB of RAM as well as an additional SSD hard drive to round out the machine... both can be purchased separately on Amazon at good prices and easily added. (Plenty on vids on the tube to help if you need it). I wish the keyboard was RGB instead of just red, but the red is nice, and dims so you can use at night without issue. I give it 4 stars overall since it's not a 'hardcore' gaming machine, but for value, it's a 5 star deal (as long as you don't choose to overpay in these odd times).",0
Se tardo mucho en llegar. A la final resulta una excelente compra la recomiendo. Es rápida la estoy usando para trabajo y hasta los momentos va todo muy bien.,0
Great product that is easy to use and has all of the necessities.,0
Not impressed with Chromebook!!! I regret purchasing the HP Chromebook and unfortunately it is to late to send it back.,0
While this laptop can and still does perform quite well in terms of power delivery for applications and games the keyboard now has multiple keys that can't be used. This seems to be a common problem with many similar models according to their forums (also no reply from MSI on these posts) one other problem with this laptop is even though it can play render games around 90fps I could never get it to output more than 60 to an external 144hz monitor or get gsync to activate no matter what drivers I installed or what cords I used and the screen tearing was nearly unbearable without these.,0
if you're looking for a high standard of quality and portability then this laptop is the way to go!,0
"Screen is fantastic, sharp clear good colors.",0
I am really happy with my purchase and very impressed. To be fair I cant' rate battery life just yet as I just got it but by every other measure I don't expect to be disappointed. The keyboard feels great. The backlight isn't too obnoxious. The touchpad is appropriately responsive. It has good airflow... which is really important considering most age failures are a result of heat. If I had to say one bad thing it would be the process of registering the product through MSI because their server appears to be down. I'd really like to register this soon.,0
"La laptop es buena, pero se calienta mucho incluso cuando está en el escritorio. Si la quieres para jugar tampoco es buena opción ya que HP le pone un límite a la VRAM de 512 MB, lo que reduce el rendimiento en juegos.",0
"Except for the Windows operating system and all of the frustrations with continuous updates of never actually ready for production software from Microsoft … the hardware seems to work flawlessly, over all it's cost-effective and serves a need for a dependable professional, up-to-date-but-not-bleeding-edge laptop … when the operating system becomes unworkable, I'll install Mint … and order an newer, cheap laptop with Windows for those things that still require Microsoft.",0
The battery did not last 8 hour like it said it would only for about a hour it all so seem to get very hot and the fans fid not kick in I felt I needed to return instead of getting it server's when I buy something new I expect it to work better then it did.,0
"the battery simply not working properly, to missing nearly all the required video drivers and windows updates",0
You can not upgrade to Windows Pro,0
The laptop softly whispered in my ears via the sound jack at crisp quality only a laptop of this mangitutde can provide.,0
"UPDATE: I was able to install Windows 11 from the Microsoft store, so it is available for this model although it did not come installed. Bluetooth still didn't work, but I bought the $19 ASUS USB Bluetooth dongle and it works great.INITIAL REVIEW: This was described as having bluetooth and Windows 11. There is a bluetooth function on the computer but it won't connect to any of my devices, and the computer has Windows 10, not Windows 11. I am giving three stars because it was affordable and seems to be working in spite of the false advertising and lack of connectivity. I bought a bluetooth dongle, hopefully that will help. If I had spent $500+ I would have been p*ssed.",0
it was very fast considering its weight and size.,0
My granddaughter loved this gift for graduation.,0
Works great very fast does everything I bought it for,0
one of the fans rattled a little after awhile,0
"El Excel 365 le va muy lento, al desplazarse entre celdas se cuelgaEn teoría es una computadora top y no es aceptable es funcionamiento",0
"Buen equipo, increible pantalla y acabados de calidad. El teclado numerico esta mal diseñado, lo demas increible.",0
Purchased for work. Absolutely perfect.,0
"I bought this laptop with the intention of using it for my hospital training modules and casual use at home. Although, I haven’t bought a laptop since 2009, I’ve used a variety of laptops through friends and family members. The look, the feel and the quickness when switching through applications is really is so so smooth. I’m not a techy guy, but if you want a laptop for school, work or travel, I think this is the best bet.",0
"I was kind of annoyed it came with windows 10-S, but it was easy and free to switch.",0
"The charger port is a little loose so I charge it at night. Battery lasts a long time once charged. Usually have about 6 tabs open at once and it runs just fine. I use it for basic internet searching, paper writing, etc.",0
this is a fine laptop that very much swings above its weight class it runs cool and silent when in any day to day use. When gaming it handles it shockingly well although the fans get a bit loud when its working hard. all in all I cant imagine there is anything in this price range that outshines it.,0
"Great for gaming, runs just about anything at max graphics settings without issues. The RTX 3060 never struggles with temperature. However, under heavy load, the Intel i5-12500H does. It regularly reaches 180°F and sometimes higher, even with the fans at full blast. I got a cooling pad for it which definitely helps bring that CPU temp down a little, though it still can get pretty hot, which isn't good for its lifespan.",0
THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. If I could give it 0 stars I would. I have owned it for one week of light use. It no longer turns on. RETURNING!!!,0
"I received this laptop as a gift in 2017, and for the past 5 years it has only exceeded expectations relative to the price. I mostly play fps titles such as siege and Overwatch, both of which run smoothly. Using a bit of DIY skills the useful lifespan of this laptop can be extended by years. About 2 years in I added RAM, 4 years in a repasted the chips and all thermal throttling went away. Recently, I built a new PC in order to have hardware with a clear upgrade path, but my laptop is still perfectly acceptable for running every game I am interested in five years later (with a few minor upgrades/repairs. ). The only con is the battery life, but that was never an issue for me as almost all public spaces in 2022 have easy access to outlets.",0
Es un producto de exelente calidad y que tiene mucha durabilidad y es muy eficiente es posible que le falle un poco en el tema de almacemiento y en la batería pero bale la pena.?,0
"The screen won't turn off 1/2 the time, so I have to turn off then turn back on again. It randomly freezes also, requiring force shutdown.This is just within 1 month of owning. I will be contacting support, but a new laptop shouldn't have these problems.Wish I went with another brand.",0
The chromebook did meet my expectations.,0
Just purchased and is working as expected,0
"I am not a very demanding computer user - just some web surfing and shopping, so I figured this computer would suffice, and I have been very happy with ASUS products in the past. But this computer is constantly bogging down, due to the CPU and the RAM being maxed out, according to the task manager. It has great battery life, and is very lightweight, but I wish I could at least put more RAM in it. Alas, it is not possible to upgrade the RAM due to the fact that it is soldered to the motherboard, according to other reviewers. I wish now, that I had bought a model with a better CPU and more RAM.",0
I purchased this laptop because of the 2 USB ports and the HDMI port listed in the specs and description. This laptop arrived dead and with only one USB port. Will be returning.,0
Great starter computer. Works great for my kids in elementary school,0
"Produit de qualité correct sans plus. Il n'y a pas de clic droit d'intégré, pas d'ecran tactile et ça ne semble pas être une version très récente du Chrome OS. Peut toujours être utile mais ne pensez pas l'utiliser comme appareil principal. En revanche, les apps comme Facebook, Netflix, YouTube et Tou.tv fonctionnement bien.",0
Reúne todos los que yo esperaba,0
"Cuando tenía un %12 de batería y estaba viendo una película de repente se congelo y no respondía hasta que me apareció el mensaje con pantalla azul y ya van más de 3 ocaciones en las que al tratar de apagar el equipo no se apaga y se queda en gris la pantalla, por lo demás la verdad el equipo es muy rápido y los tiempos de carga son excelentes, con una pantalla que en algunos ángulos se mira opaca pero no lo considero algo molesto, el material si se siente plástico que se raya fácilmente.",0
"The laptop is really fast due to ssd m.2 drive and 8gb ddr4 ram. I did not notice any screen quality issues, as for me the screen is good enough. Approximately 80 gb of space is available ( other space is occupied by windows) so making a little upgrade like installing additional ssd would be a good idea. The sound is not very loud, but sufficient for watching movies.To Sum up:WeaknessesSound ( slightly)Memory ( upgrade needed)StrengthsThin, lightweight, fast, priceOverall-good laptop for business and personal needs (not gaming), and even weaknesses do not seem critical, considering the price.",0
Buena compra,0
"i am not really into gaming, so i cannot say how well this computer is as far as games. However i am into photography and videography, and this is a vast improvement over my desktop setup. firstly, i have been trying to recover a formatted HDD, wife thought she was formatting a thumb drive, my desktop setup was taking 27 1/2 hours for scanning and it is a nice comp for video editing. this laptop said, i can do it faster, and after a 9 1/4 hour scan it was finished. processing a 30 min video was taking about 1 1/2 hour and the laptop with the same settings for the video did it in half the time.i think for now on, every time i need to upgrade to a new photo and video setup i am going for a gaming setup instead, it apparently is a lot faster",0
"it will get hot and loud when you do that, the heat has to go somewhere",0
The computer screen died in the 3rd day sent it back for refund,0
I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this laptop. I've had no issues what so ever since I got it. If you're looking to get started out in gaming and not wanting a full blown rig this is the right choice.,0
"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip. A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1. my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2. my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad). If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa. Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET. THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!",0
Great specs and well built but laptop life is around an hour with just google chrome running (writing an essay). If you don’t mind staying plugged it it’s fine.,0
product quality,0
"Pros:-Great specs-Good cooling-Nice display and thin bezels-Build quality seems decent-Great keyboard with awesome lighting-LightweightCons:-Screen had backlight bleed in 1 spot-Case doesn't close completely when there is a hard drive installed-Battery life isn't great at all-Lots of preinstalled software (although some of the preinstalled software was cool, such as an included android emulator)",0
"This was purchased for my son to download his high school textbooks for use. Although lightweight and less expensive, the lack of sensitivity of the touchpad makes using this with ease kind of frustrating. That being said, my son loves it.",0
the screen resolution is as high as FHD 1080P,0
"Es un excelente equipo, vengo de un PC de escritorio y es mi primer Laptop con Tarjeta de Video dedicada, me animé sobre todo por que tiene memoria RAM DDR5, lo mejor fue el precio, por poco menos de 19k considero que es una ganga por las prestaciones que ofrece, le agregue 32gb de RAM y un SSD extra de 1TB ya sumando todo me gaste 24k. Me fue mejor que la TUF 2021 que estaba en 30kAunque no la usare principalmente para jugar, he probado algunos juegos y corre bastante bien el Gears 5, Halo TMCC, Halo Infinite, la temperatura es adecuada y como todo dispositivo requerirá sus mantenimientos oportunos, Para jugar prefiero usar mis consolas o bien la de escritorio que puedo exigirle el máximo sin preocuparme de las temperaturas.Para la programación, programas de edición y gráficos es muy buen equipo, es una buena compra para cualquier estudiante que requiera de un equipo con buenas prestaciones.El equipo de 16GB de RAM y SSD de 500GB a como viene de fabrica es excelente, si puedes agrégale más RAM o bien aumenta el SSD que 500GB los consumes en poco tiempo.Pros:-Procesador de última generación-Memoria RAM DDR5-Slot extra M.2-Buena duración de batería 4-6 hrs en modo Eco-Dise?o sobrio, excelente que la iluminación sea blanco y no el árbol de navidad rgb-Touchpad de muy buen tama?o-Teclado Completo-Pantalla más que excelente-Puertos USB C, HDMI es excelente que aún incluya este puerto.-Buen sonido, bastante equilibrado-Buenos materiales de construcciónContras:-SSD de fabrica muy sencillo-16GB en 2x8GB lo que te obliga a comprar 2 memorias para expandir-Cámara web justa-La apertura de cubierta inferior es sencilla pero si eres principiante puede ser un poco complicado",0
"Crashed within weeks, can't seem to get ahold of any type of service support.",0
Nice came exactly how it was stated delivered in good conditon. Came on time so far so good update in a few weeks,0
"I bought this for class and it had terrible connectivity, so I had to return it.",0
I have still got to get the hang of it. Looks great. Let us see how it goes.,0
"Thermals are great and the hotkey to toggle between silent, balanced, and turbo is wonderful.",0
I've had this for 9 months and the touch screen no longer works and the port doesn't charge anymore.,0
Everything was as described. Runs great and no dead pixels.,0
I bought it as a gift for my sister. I loved it and so does she.,0
I think this laptop is a piece of art,0
"This is a Chromebook, its not a laptop, so I was not expecting it to do anything too intense, just needed it for some basic writing assignments and on the go needs. It is perfect for the basics.",0
the only drawback with this laptop is the coil whine this thing is annoying me when I am in a quiet room. Unfortunately I can't return mine because I don't live in US and I am far away now.,0
Nice Chromebook overall but has an issue where it does not wake up from sleep. Tried to reset and that didn't work. Only resolution is to go to power settings and select keep display on and deselect sleep when lid is closed.,0
It is a very cool laptop with good hardware preference,0
This laptop will definitely be worth your money if you don't plan on having a whole gaming set up like a monitor and computer and all of that' if you want something really amazing fast and slick looking buy this laptop its one of my best purchases. I highly recommend this laptop for any person that's starting a gamming set up that's basic and cheap but really efficient and fast and can run every game you could think of and looks realistic its overall one of the best laptops you could own. Get this laptop and you will not be disappointed.,0
"I am not a gamer, but I got sick of everything loading so slowly, this seems to do the trick.",0
Absolutely amazing value. I had another laptop that was just too slow for my needs. I love chrome.,0
"AI will support all Adobe software, which will allow up to a 30 percent boost in performance while editing in apps like Adobe Premiere",0
Bad products,0
Great screen color! Ease of use! Wish it was a little lighter.,0
I like that they use the 75% keyboard layout so you have your arrows and navigation/editing buttons on the right and a full function row.,0
It does come pre-loaded with a lot of bloatware,0
I know nothing about technology but it was been a 99% great experience as for it being smooth and running well. My only issue is that the audio has been terrible ever since I took it out of the box. Great for college students though.,0
"Got mine on Wednesday and it’s fantastic! Computer in near perfect shape, works fast, easy to get set up. I have had no issues and happily recommend. Will update again later.",0
"I had a dell so slow that I would turn it on and have to wait 30 minutes and it might be done thinking to use it. This Acer, I turn it on, do my work and done. It’s fast, easy and I really like it",0
"E piu cattivo di un vichingo, piu resistente di uno spartano e piu veloce di mbappe",0
PROS:Great Value/price ratioI have enjoyed used it and performance is great- fast and seamless use of windows.CONS:Touchscreen stopped working suddenly after 7 monthsLenovo service took 1 month to service the computer- terrible auto service web siteUpdate: Even though Lenovo replaced the screen- it failed again after 2 months- now out of warranty and using as a laptop without the touchscreen- frustrating. Not buying Lenovo again.The power connection and headphone connections are next to each other. Way too easy to connect your headphones to the power connectorOn/Off bottom on the side- when handling the computer easy to turn it off inadvertentlyToo much fan noise- can get hot (unlike Yoga 710),0
The power adapter brick gets so hot that it burns your hand by holding it.,0

"It has great potential but the screen was damaged, it has a bright spot which is visible with white background and not so visible when the screen is dark.

Not touch screen,0
"Nothing super impressive & certainly not for gaming or anything, but for light activities like browsing the internet or watching something on Netflix, it gets the job done",0
"I bought 2, 1 worked for 1 week, the second never worked.Had to spend US$150 to fix both.",0
"As per what I've come to expect with Dell hardware, it comes installed with quite a few things I don't really need, however, it definitely does its job for gaming and is decently comfortable for typing as long as you have a laptop desk to protect your lap or use it on a desk.The orange backlit keyboard is pretty nice for typing (using it to type this review right now) and doesn't feel super mushy like some laptop membrane keyboard, though I'm not yet sure if that'll hold up to long-term hardcore gaming, so even if you're playing at LAN parties elsewhere, I'd probably bring a dedicated keyboard (and of course a mouse) and that brings me to the peripherals.Basically, this has enough USB ports for a mouse and keyboard and 2 spare ports for other items, or if you happen to use one of the wireless keyboard/mouse combos that use 1 dongle, you'd have 3 available. As well, it does have a standard headphone/mic jack for gaming headset needs along with an ethernet port, and it only has 1 HDMI or you have to use 1 of the USB ports as well for another monitor. I'd say if you're going to use this as your main gaming machine, it would probably be best to invest in a USB dock that can help you solve your port problem, though you'll have to check those specs on them especially since not all of them support high refresh rate gaming, so watch out for that.Another thing that this does well with is sound quality. I won't say it's super amazing, but you won't be disappointed with the experience, though you'll definitely want a headset when you're not at home with this.I will also say that this thing gets HOT. Even when it's only using the onboard graphics this thing can kick out heat so be careful when letting it sleep as sometimes it doesn't completely sleep and can get quite hot, so make sure it's well vented when plugged in so you don't have any hot surprises! The brick also cooks as well at times so be careful of that.Overall, it's a decent gaming laptop, though I'd say it's better as a mobile gaming machine over your main machine, but I'm blessed enough to have a gaming PC that outclasses this laptop but is a royal pain to travel with over this.",0
the battery life isn’t that great,0
This product was a gift for a recent high school graduate who needs it for college in the fall (and is using it right now as well). Recipient liked all the features of this lap top.,0
"Can only have two large installed games at a time, ""gaming laptop"" but can only handle two, im constantly uninstalling / reinstalling new games... didnt do enough research not worth 1700$ when i got it",0
"Very portable, good battery life, and I love the touch screen!",0
"At the price of $580 or so (price has gone up but will likely fluctuate so watch carefully), this is a bargain. It manages to be a basic but not bare-bones laptop that can handle casual games needing at least an i5 processor and the screen is a good quality, pleasing experience with depth and no annoying glare or satin softness. Images are crisp and clean and clear; even low-resolution images are displayed at their best.The keyboard and pad work as expected and there is good button feel, plenty of ports in the right places (3 total USB, HDMI, power cord, etc.), and everything works as expected except faster, if you're used to an i3 or earlier. The only real challenge I've given it is LOTRO and Witcher 3 and both operate flawlessly with the stock set up, no modifications. So if plug-and-play is how you roll, this is an excellent high-powered option for the casual gamer in need of all the usual business software in a low-priced package.Sound is OK. Fans are a bit loud but they appear to be very effective and the unit doesn't get hot. Power On to fully functional takes seconds. Not more bloatware than average but you will spend a few minutes setting it up and getting rid of unnecessary apps.Acer makes solid products aimed at the lower end of the market and this one is quite good for what it is. They also have good customer service and as other reviewers have noted, their products can be easily upgraded. I won't need to do that with the Nitro b/c it suits my needs but there are plenty of options.Excellent gaming computer!",0
"I bought it to replace my 6 years old laptop. I was really happy when I first got it and I used it to play games like darksoulIII and Battlefield V with my friends. It worked very well. However, I encountered Blue screen death for the first time at the end of December. At that time, I thought it was only the issue of that one single software, because it worked so well for everything else. That is how I lost my chance of return.As my friends get busy and I started to play some other games, I notice the issue is not limited to that one software. I encountered blue screen for tons of other games. Since then, I had spent a month running all kinds of testing softwares to test its CPU, RAM, GPU. I scanned the system files, scanned the disk. I updated my drivers and BIOS. I bought an additional cooling fan to reduce its heat. I reinstall the system. I brought it to a nearby laptop fixing store for examination. I tried everything I can think of, yet no problem can be located and issue has still not been solved yet. I am really tired and exhausted.I am not even sure I can get a warranty or not as I lost my receipt. Really Sad and Mad at this moment. And tired.",0
Had a year and a half and no drops or anything and the screen is flickering and is impossible to use. Dell needs to pick up their quality won’t buy another Dell,0
I have a single pixel that is a bright green all the time,0
"Awesome Laptop, Best Buy for your money, Almost the highest specs for a great value, Speakers are great, real loud, i'm not sure why others tell the speakers are bad, on youtube videos etc the volume is really high, on the netflix app its a bit low but still great, that is one thing i noticed about the speakers, keyboard is fantastic to type. i have not tested the battery life yet but I think the battery life is only the con as per the other reviews, I found out nothing else as a con, BUY WITHOUT HESITATION, where do you get a laptop with such specs for this money. NOWHERE!",0
this laptop is a upgrade to the acer nitro 5 laptop i got back in December it just couldnt cut it for gaming while this thing has been running quite well since i got it my games for the most part have been running fine though i would recommend upgrading ram to 32gb depending on the games you play as some game configurations wont leave you enough ram but for the most part ive been quite happy with the laptop ive only had it for about 10 days so far,0
The MacBook delivers top-notch performance! It’s 14 hours of battery life delivers!!! The bright and colorful display all in is a delightfully portable design. It’s truly worthy of the Air name.,0
"to quickly summarize it... this thing is slow. bought it for my fiance, so she can do her online classes on the go. its so slow and frustrating that she just waits to get home and use the desktop. lol. oh well.",0
"Returning after a week. Shut off while taking notes in class, lame and embarrassing.",0
"The battery life is not lasting, that is my only problem with this laptop.",0
It's an awesome gaming laptop.I chose the lowest one RTX 3060 yet it plays Elden Ring on max setting without even straining one bit.Only down side is the weight but then again it's manageable.It doesn't have a camera but that doesn't bother me.All in all this is an awesome machine which can handle any Demanding game that exist for a reasonable price.Go for it. ?,0
started crashing randomly turning black screen and forcing me to press the battery reset bottom on the bottom of the laptop.,0
"I am so upset. I regret buying this. It is so limited, I can't even use it for what I bought it for. I'm going to try to figure out how to replace it...",0
Good all-round business/home machine. There is enough speed and power for my usage and it's easy to carry on business trips. I wish it was touch screen but the back-lit keyboard was a bigger priority. I understand what people mean with the soggy touch pad as it gets a bit of getting used to. Lets hope the screen hinge lasts longer than my last ASUS did which crapped out on me at about 18 months - but I was admittedly hard on it.,0
Stop working after a couple months.Right after the return window closed.,0
"ReturedSeveral dead pixels in the screenWill try again with a new one, seems like a great machine other than that",0
"Ignore the bad review , that guy doesn’t have a clue , , I love it and I’m using it a lot and I recommend you to get the MacBook Air m2, has an amazing screen and its really fast",0
A powerful portable computer. My son loves it for medium gaming and photo editing.,0
"Screen has a lot of bleed at the corners. After about 6 months many of my games began to over heat the cpu after an hour and a hslf of play. I cannot even play Alpha Protocol on high game setting. GPU seems cool and the air coming out is cool, but whete vpu is at there is no air flow. Otherwise its an alright computer..",0
"I was able to get 150fps+ on medium settings consistently in Valorant, Overwatch, and COD Modern Warfare, which was a huge upgrade from my old 60 fps laptop. Noise and temperature have not been an issue except when running on the highest settings for a long time. Only negative is battery life, which isn't great, but my laptop is almost always plugged in anyway so it hasn't been much of a problem for me. Overall, great purchase for the money and would highly recommend for someone looking for an upgrade.",0
Works great!,0
The colors were really beautiful.,0
"Uno de los mejores equipos en calidad precio del mercado, sin duda la recomiendo.",0
Excellent laptop for gaming and everyday use,0
The grandkids love them.,0
"I've been blown away by how well this laptop performs for the price I paid for it. I'm very happy with my purchase. Setup was a breeze. My games have run flawlessly. The battery may be an issue for some. I usually keep my laptop plugged in so it's not an issue for me. There's an option to stop the battery charging at 80% which will extend the life of the battery when you keep it plugged in like I do, so that option is very useful to me.If you're on a budget and you want a decent gaming laptop, I'd recommend this one with maybe some tinkering to help with a shorter battery life.",0
"Absolutely amazing laptop! Runs games with zero lag. I was lucky to get it for $579, and would recommend checking this frequently as it goes super fast at that price.",0
"I needed something small for work and travel, but strong enough to do light gaming, preferably heavy gaming.",0
"So far so good (4mo). Fast start and runs well. However, like other reviewers have mentioned, it is rather loud. Also, wish the chrome body attracts less finger prints.",0
"I have model # 14-DF0023CL, the variant sold at C*stco.The performance components and screen are better than expected for the price. But the chassis build quality and keyboard will remind you it is not designed for heavy use. It’s just fine for non-business travel - a much more functional device than a tablet, for those having higher requirements than web browsing or video watching. You can do real office work or photo editing.Of course, “S” mode can be disabled so you can install your favorite Windows 3rd party applications, instead of being limited to the ones in the Microsoft Store.The reasons this low cost machine stands out from its peers: 1080p IPS display, Intel core i3-8130U processor, upgradeable꙳ M.2 Samsung PM871b SATA 3 SSD drive, upgradeable꙳ DDR4 RAM. Unfortunately, all the common user-serviceable components; such as battery, RAM, and storage drive; are accessed by removing the entire bottom cover꙳.꙳ HP service manual warning: For authorized service providers only. But the adventurous reader having a guitar pick and screwdriver can figure it out at the expense of voiding the warranty.There are 2 memory slots, slot #1 is occupied: Samsung DDR4-2666 M471A5244CB0-CTD. This one is 1Rx16, in case you want to add a matching 2nd SO-DIMM for faster dual channel operation.There is a 2.5” SATA drive bay, but no cables or drive caddy are provided. The M.2 slot supports either SATA 3 or PCIe 3x4 NVMe drives.I upgraded the M.2 drive to a Mushkin PCIe NVMe. Disk benchmarks are attached. While the serial transfer rates are exceedingly fast, the 4K random [low queue depth] are the more important values to consider for common work scenarios. The original Samsung PM871b is actually quite respectable.With laptops, I like to test drive myself. The keyboard action and certain display characteristics are hard to evaluate from specs and reviews. This machine’s keyboard is just acceptable – the layout and size is fine, but the hardware quality is marginal, making it difficult to accurately type quickly. The touchpad works well enough. The screen is very glossy, which is problematic in some work environments, but otherwise I think it’s good. The graphics card does a fine job of driving my external 1440p monitor via HDMI.",0
"AL inicio todo bien, con el uso normal, ni siquiera forzado, se bloquea apagando el monitor y sin apagarse calentandose, hasta forzarse con el boton a apagarse, tarda en prender nuevamente por el calentamiento previo. Lmantablemente ya no entro en garantia y ahora tengo que buscar otra solucion.",0
Consistente la calidad y el precio .,0
Runs slow and does not hold a charge. No touch screen at all.,0
Excelente gráficos excelente iluminación y sonido,0
"Seems to be a common problem. Thunderbolt 4 ports failed after 5 months. Now I have to find a box and pack it up to send in to LG for repair. Also glossy screen is obnoxious and it wiggles when you touch it. Did not purchase at Amazon. If you own one, check to see whether Thunderbolt 4 ports can charge your phone. If they can't it needs repair.",0
Should have lit key's,0
This computer is very fast and runs anything I throw at it with exceptional performance,0
It's great laptop but not as fast thought it would be. Multitasking on laptop seem too much for the computer sometimes. But overall performance is great.,0
All sides are metal (even the vent grills) and when you first lift it you instantly know it's built like a tank.,0
"I bought this laptop for my wife, with whom I and other family and friends will often play online games. She was not entirely sure why I felt the need to give this to her since her experiences with laptop gaming had always been substandard, but I insisted that her work laptop needed replacing anyway and it was a decent price. She relented and neither of us have had any reason for regret since. The speed and power of this slick little machine is impressive for its cost point. It has also changed her gaming habits and she is much happier for it. The one thing that we have noticed is that the fan whines a little on the loud side when gaming, but it hasn't bothered my wife at all because it's not loud enough to be heard through her headphones while gaming. Everything else including its size and profile has just been lovely.",0
This was not the correct color or size and it's not touchscreen.,0
Its of low quality.,0
A++++,0
"I bought this laptop mostly for Final Fantasy 14, and man did it deliver. Consistent high frame rate, a beautiful 144hz screen, efficient cooling, what's not to love? Lenovo has minimal bloatware and their proprietary software is intuitive and actually useful. Cannot recommend it enough!",0
While I have only used for 2 hours. It has been smooth sailing during set up. I did not have to do any manual back door work around. Things funtioned well. I wondered if a lighted keyboard was a bunch of not need feature. Nowafter 2 hours not sure I would ever be without one. While I can type my figures often use the backup key for correction. The lighted keyboard makes that easy. I have noticed a great the case is built. Only about quarter inch on each side of screen so it almost feels like a 15.6 computer but with a bigger screen. Display has great color.I like the power chord hook up out the back verse always having a chord hanging on the side you have to be careful to not bump.The feature I rank the best is the fact that the screen is approximately a full inch over the keyboard. Meaning you are not looking at your fingers but at the screen while your typing. Something I always found annoying comparedto desktops.The keyboard has a nice touch. While it is not ultra thin like some I also don't feel like I am going to break it because it is brittle.This computer is fast that means heat when you give it a challenge. There is lots of good case venilation. Overall after 2 hours I am very please with my purchase. I am not a gamer but who knows maybe I will be if Covid continues.,0
Excellent product and packaging!!!,0
For the price it’s a pretty reliable gaming laptop. Perfect for the gamer on the go who keeps their real equipment at home.,0
"I love the laptop, not for gaming tho",0
Mouse is suspect but everything else is great. Heavy and clunky.,0
I like everything about it. No complaints at all.,0
This has been a great computer so far.,0
La pc cumple lo que esta en el anuncio,0
Awesome gpu and ssd. Screen is reflect proof but is fuzzy at angles. Overall great machine!,0
"I am happy with this ""new version"" of the Acer Chromebook. It is exactly the same unit outside for sure and I cannot distinguish any internal differences either from the Chromebook I replaced that had been purchased refurbished over two years ago. Not saying I dont like this unit because I do but I can tell no difference whatsoever in operating or internet speed let along startup speed. The blue tooth function is always cutting out and the wi-fi is unchanged so dont get that. It is still the best bargain out there for people like me who mainly to banking...email correspondence...and get their news off the net. I will buy another one when this one deteriorates but dont expect any difference from previous years models.",0
"I had a 10 hour flight and I wanted to code, and I found out you could put this in developer mode on top of being able to use it for 11 hours. So, somewhat skeptical, I went to my closest Wally World (Walmart) and I bought one (it was $150 then and $100 on black friday.) Side note: don't get the new samsung chromebook 3 they are trying to peddle, it's actually worse than this one.Anyways, this chromebook is absolutely amazing. I cannot believe the power this little thing has. It has an absolutely silent operating because of the Solid State Drive (faster and better than Hard Disk Drive for those wondering) and the processor is absolutely speedy. The speed of this is really amazing for how little it is. This is one of those devices that just works so well.I put Linux on it through developer mode (tutorials online) and somewhat was skeptical that it would actually be able to support something like Intellij iDE, which is a coding environment that takes up a lot of memory (this computer has 4GB, which is a lot for something this small.) Amazingly, this computer runs Intellij like an absolute boss. There is slight lag when it's linting your code, but come one, it's a tiny computer; that's getting so picky. The chrome OS is how a lightweight OS should be. It's just perfect. Out of all the electronics i have bought over the years, this is by far the most impressive how much it does for how cheap and in as little space as it is. It is lighter than a book of its size. You can watch youtube for iike 7 or 8 hours and can code for about 8 or 9 on intellij IDE. You will rarely ever charge this.This computer is one of those items that reminds us what year we are in; a decade ago something like this this computer would have been absolute trash, but the tech is such today that we can have a really fast and small machine for not a lot of cash.",0
"This laptop has everything I need without paying a high price. Nice to look at, super thin and light weight, and was easy to set up, and it came with Windows 11!",0
Arrivé comme prévu. C'est comme une grosse tablette avec un clavier,0
The battery doesn't last long but overall for gaming it is a pretty impressive laptop. I love it!,0
"The keyboard backlight isn't working, the customer service made me wait for more than 1 hour with no solution at the end, frustrating experience.",0
"I won't lie, I was so afraid about this laptop and if it was going to live up to the hype. I am in shock, it went above and beyond. The graphics are smooth, the color is vibrant, the sound is decent, and the game play is flawless. I'm recommending this laptop to my gamer friends.",0
Device in good condition and working fine. However the charger looks like it was attacked by dogs. Has multiple tears on it with the actual wire being exposed. The charger should be the easiest thing to fix. Refurbished laptop shouldn't mean a used laptop and misused charger. Didnt even bother fixing the cable. I expected a cable that is used but whole.,0
"great product, been using it everyday for gaming and streaming services without any issues",0
"He estado probando esta PC por 2 meses y hasta ahora todo muy bien en cuanto a rendimiento y rapidez, la uso para office, internet y demás.El único detalle que le veo es el ángulo de visión ya que si la cierras o abres un poco cambia mucho los colores a más claro u obscuro todo depende del ángulo y eso suele ser incómodo, la pantalla dejo mucho que desear por ese detalle, pero por el precio podría entenderlo.",0
"Everything points to this laptop being a great deal, and quite powerful for gaming overall. However, right out of the box, and after charging for 24 hours as recommended, the laptop turns on but the screen remains blank.After troubleshooting and searching online, this is a common problem where others have the same issue, with the main solution being to send in to Acer for repairs.It's probably a great laptop, and the customers who get this and have it work as it should out of the box can tell you as much. But with such an expensive item, and for what it's touted as doing, the quality control should be much better. This is a simple fix as others have said and it honestly shouldn't be happening. The box showed no signs of abuse so it clearly wasn't jossled around during delivery.Will definitely be buying a laptop in a store where I can assure that it works as expected next time. Bad luck for my product i guess",0
"Thing is fantastic. Display, great. Gaming, excellent. Battery? Best bet is to use it while its charging, otherwise, it's pretty mediocre. Regardless, great laptop 9/10 :D",0
"Fair for 200. Decent battery life , but the screen resolution is not too good and it is a little bulky.",0
"I bought this in a rush when my Dell died suddenly. I basically looked at price and the reviews. I was interested in a home laptop to use for emails, surfing, and Office applications. I'm very impressed with what I've seen so far. Good battery life, nice size (14"" seemed a lot smaller than my 17"" Dell, but as noted in other reviews, the design of the keyboard gives me the same keyboard area as my Dell) and it's very lightweight. No complaints at all. For the money I think this is a very nice laptop.",0
"I've had this laptop for 3 months now, so here goes nothing.Pros: excellent machine. It's super fast, easily keeps its framerates up without trying, has a battery life unlike any laptop I've owned before, and honestly it has just enough of that ""gamer aesthetic"" to look cool without looking like Megatron's codpiece like most other gaming laptops these days.Cons: the built-in monitor is a 60Hz display, so your framerates aren't going higher despite it easily having the spare power to do so with a better monitorThe legion logo on the back of the screen that lights up cannot be turned off, so if you play in a dark room and prefer doing so, prepare to have a beacon in the middle of your room.It's kind of a nitpick, but the soft touch material picks up oils from your skin and smudges really easily. It's not hard to clean, but it does make me add a step of ""wipe this thing down"" before packing it up to go to a friend's house, which is a minor annoyance.And now for the only real problem I have with it. It severely limits how much power the GPU can use if it's on battery. I'll be at a static 60 frames, and checking my stats, the GPU isn't taxed AT ALL with a handful of modern games, but then if the computer becomes unplugged, it locks the screen at 30 frames per second. I can tell that it doesn't seem limited to games either, because something seems slightly off with my otherwise vibrant display when it's unplugged, but I know it hadn't dimmed or anything. So if you're not near an outlet, you're not gaming (it's honestly a nightmare in competitive games). This has me concerned about the longevity of the computer's battery, because keeping it plugged in can't be good for it.",0
Great option in the product.Completely satisfied.,0
despues de un mes de compra dejo de funcionar la pantalla tactil y pregunte a varios amigos que compramos la misma laptop y tambien se les amolo a ellos (4 personas),0
SMALL BUISNESS & HOME USE,0
Best laptop I've ever had. I'm very satisfied so far especially considering I bought a used laptop.,0
I have acquired this to be used for VDI connection using Horizont Client and this works perfectly. Also I am using this to have remote access with my windows desktop and is working properly. The weight is good and the size fit perfect in my small bag pack.,0
"I needed a simple machine for wimple web browsing, nothing more. This one fills the bill. I'm sure it can do much more, but it does exactly what I need it to do, and the price was right. If you need a simple machine for simple tasks, this is a great choice. Keep in mind, it doesn't run Windows based applications. It also doesn't insist on doing updates everytime you want to get some work done :-)",0
"Muy buena computadora y precio, el único detalle que noté es que la iluminación del teclado no es tan fuerte como se muestra en las fotografías, pero es agradable cuando la iluminación del ambiente es baja.Lo demás muy bien, la estética es increíble. Para la gente de latinoamérica se puede configurar windows en espa?ol y poder usar el teclado con ? y tildes.Me encantó.",0
"This was the second time I purchased this chrome book. Last was was several yrs old. I like it so I bought the same one and recieved it the end of February. Recently, the beginning of May I used it in the morning and it was fine. Later I turned it on and had some difficulty with the screen being distorted. There was no physical damage to my laptop and know reason why it should have an issue. I Contacted support who recommended sending my Samsung Chrome book to them for diagnostic repair. They recieved it and can fix it for a charge and claiming it is not covered under warranty. I had it less than three months and due to no fault of my own it does not work . I have always purchased Samsung products but will no longer. A very disappointed and dissatisfied customer.",0
"The performance of the computer is great and works exactly has expected! Able to play COD Warzone with reasonable normal/med settings and can get 100+ FPS. The battery life is okay though and you must pull some tricks when on battery but the Fn + q to blue led (power-saver mode) helps! The in-built speakers are exceptional.MAJOR ISSUE:Stuck pixels began to appear at the bottom right of the screen and progressed from right to left. I am disappointed for the durability of the monitor. At the moment, my laptop is under warranty but I can't send it in just yet since it is more school laptop as well. :/Is this an issue for others?Thanks",0
"Perfect if your looking for an ""App"" Laptop, all my play store App games and Others on my phone is on this ""chromebook"", which is nice, i can free up space on my phone. Love itNote: This isn't A PC Laptop",0
"I financed this laptop last month only to pay it off eighteen days later from moneys saved to purchase car tires. For several days it worked like a charm until it fell from a table onto a concrete floor with my Apple iPad Pro tablet. There were no scratches nor dents on my tablet; however, my NEW Lenovo Flex 5 took a serious beating! When facing the monitor, the left corner below the keyboard is permanently bent, and the frame has buckled on that side. The speaker still works, but it is now uncomfortable to rest my arm in that area. Yet, the product now belongs to me so I decided to continue using it to learn coding and to prepare teaching engineering to high school students this fall.Based on the published description of the laptop on Lenovo's official website, I figured it can handle The Sims 4 software and the three of its expansion kits on top of my education apps- boy was I wrong! Since loading the Sims 4, the Flex 5 takes longer to restart and to process commands. The quality went from a $650 Lenovo laptop to a $199 Dell Chromebook. A total disappointment indeed! The school district invested in a $1,500 Lenonovo laptop for my engineering courses; however, the weight is unbearable to hold in one arm after two minutes. The Flex 5 was going to work wonders due to having the capability to rotate the monitor behind the keyboard to convert it into a tablet. I just have to remind myself to remove the clear keyboard cover to prevent it from falling to the ground. The finger ID makes it convenient to log on; however, the processing speed is not what I expected. I should have waited and saved moneys to purchase another Apple Macbook Air, because my 2013 laptop fell onto concrete in the past and is still going strong without any physical damages.This purchase altered my perception of Lenovo by far, and I will consider purchasing a Samsung laptop the next go round. :-(",0
Perfect product for the easy computer tasks! It's quick and easy to navigate.It does a lot for it's size!,0
"El pc es Increíble nos encanto cumple con las expectativas par el trabajo que se compro, lo MALO es que queremos comprar otro portátil y ahora no nos deja hacer la compra por que dice que no se puede enviar a esta misma ubicación! ayúdenos a resolver esto por que queremos comprar otro igual",0
I don't like at all anymore!!,0
Going great...just needed to replace keyboard...spilled coffee. Note to all - turn off computer immediately if you spill anything on keyboard.,0
It’s an excellent computer,0
"Trying to get a 3070 alone right now in 2021, it’s nearly impossible to get one under at least $1000 so getting this laptop at $1500 was a very solid deal. Could barely even build a pc for the same parts.I like to game with it and I mine on the side, getting about 50.5 MH/s after overclocks with 85 watts of power used so it is super efficient.It was getting pretty hot almost 90 Celsius at first but I bought a $25 laptop cooler + adjusted the fan curves and it significantly cooled to 71 degrees. not ideal but not bad at all. Also doing this made it fairly loud, its white noise to me so I don’t mind it, but might be a deal breaker to some.",0
"I like the laptop very much and planned to buy it for my son’s Christmas gift, but the price just keep on increasing and I start to think if there is other options. I have decided to just build a pc since it is cheaper and have a better performance anyway. I am leaving a comment to remind the buyers to see if the price keep on increasing then just buy the i7 one instead. The i7-9750h (way faster cpu) come with gpu rxt 2060 (bang on the money) and 16 go of ddr4 ram (no upgrade needed.) Only thing is to add another ssd or hhd (2tb recommended.) Hope if this help!",0
"I bought this because I'm a freelance writer and I needed a cheap, portable machine for typing and emailing. It does much more than that.It's got great speakers, so it's replaced my desktop as my go-to Netflix machine, and the keyboard has a nice, soft touch. If you're looking for a computer for web browsing, streaming media, email or basic office applications, I'd definitely recommend this device.",0
"As you can see in the picture I have included, the end that goes into the charging brick does not fully go in. Moving it around will disconnect your laptop from charging. I have had this laptop for 7 months and don't get me wrong I love the laptop is just the charging brick. Either I have gotten a faulty charging brick or Asus needs to recheck there items.",0
"Super fast shipping! I ordered at 1am and it arrived at 7:40pm the same day, I selected free 2 day shipping so I was pleasantly surprised. The laptop worked just fine straight from the box. I just turned it on and signed in to my Google account. It's very simple to use and fits my need for a school use laptop. I love the selection of Chrome extensions and apps. I'm in college and also use this for homeschooling my daughter. I use Google classrooms, which works great on this Samsung Chromebook. It's fast and user friendly. I have an hp desktop I use for gaming and other heavy duty stuff. This laptop is perfect for on the go lessons and homework. It is refurbished, but looks new and works like new.",0

"I use this laptop for gaming, schoolwork, etc.It does great in modeling software like AutoDesk Inventor and SolidWorks. These calculations are done very quickly.For games, I can run Ultra settings in Halo: Infinite at 72FPS with VSync on for a very clear image and it will never dip. It maxes at about 117-120fps.The internal storage is only NVMe only, so no cheap 2.5in SSD will fit. Expandable memory up to 32GB. Comes with 16GB installed and 528GB NVMe.",0
Very satisfied only thing I didn’t like is that it doesn’t have a disk drive,0
"*Actualizado. Aun pienso que es muy buen equipo, muy veloz en el arranque y el audio genial, además de una apariencia simple pero agradable. Excelente para remplazar una computadora de escritorio, si estará conectada la mayor parte del tiempo, ya que la duración de la batería es media (con un uso que considero ""de oficina"", la batería parece durar entre 3 y 4 horas). El ruido de los ventiladores no es molesto cuando no hay calentamiento interno de las tarjetas, pero con juegos, además de que se calienta demasiado (la probé con Civilization VI), los ventiladores encienden a su máximo y da la sensación de que se fundirá el procesador o la tarjeta gráfica. La pantalla es buena, se trabaja muy bien con el teclado y el touchpad exelente.",0

My first Acer Chromebook. Easy to set up. I added a mouse because that works better for me. Like not having to buy security . Would purchase again,0
Everything was as promised....love my new laptop,0
"For it's size and price, you get a LOT of horsepower. The screen is very nice, the CPU is very fast, and with the GPU, I can throw anything at it and play at Ultra/Max. I did upgrade the RAM to 40gb (swapped a 8gb out for a 32gb), and added a 1TB SSD in the previously empty secondary HDD slot. The battery life is reasonable if you're using it to just browse the web or remote in to work, I can get about 3-4 hours. If you are trying to play AAA games, the battery life is good for short gaming sessions of around an hour or two.Last thing: It's hot! Literally, if you plan on using this on your lap while playing games you'll need to get a cooling pad or lap pad of some sort because the air being blown out is very hot.",0
Very smooth hard to bog down!,0
"can't find out how to turn backlight on. also, on my old hp, the number lock button lit up when it was on. this new doesn't do that. very helpful if light was on.",0
the fingerprint reader is weak,0
Nothing wrong with the norebook. It was for wife's birthday and she didn't want it.,0
"I bought this laptop to dip my toes in the water for PC gaming and also to use as a personal PC for emails, browsing the web, etc. I used a separate monitor as I wasn't using this as a mobile gaming set-up. The version I got with the i7 and 3060 laptop GPU was great for warzone. I was able to run well above standard graphics on Warzone at about 100FPS. I never had any issues with overheating, although I did buy a cheap ""fan deck"" to put the laptop on. The fan isn't quiet, but that is to be expected with any gaming laptop, especially when under stress. I have since bought a full gaming desktop as I realized I did want to fully make the jump from console to PC but I gave this laptop to my wife who plays the Sims and Age of Empires and she has seen HUGE performance boosts compared to her older Asus Nitro 5. Her games run much smoother on this laptop. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get into pc gaming or someone that is looking for a multi-use portable PC. Be sure to check the specs and reviews for the specific model you're buying as Amazon shows reviews for similar pcs with different internal specs.",0
"Love this laptop because it's cheap, it's fast and it does what I need.",0
"I bought this laptop to use at school, so that I could study as well as play games such as Far Cry 5 or Counter Strike.",0
For its small light size it has a big clear screen. The amazing thing is that it just takes seconds to come up after being shut down. I always thought hotels had bad WiFi until I got this laptop and found out it was just my misfortune to have had 2 previous laptops that where inferior.,0
2nd one we’ve bought!,0
its okay just want more access to apps in the app store,0
HP laptop was slightly used from the Amazon Warehouse. Laptop looks new! No scratches or marks.Runs smoothly after three months. I saved hundreds by buying from the Warehouse!,0
"I purchased this laptop as a replacement for my 10+year-old desk top. I'm retired and I was concerned that the transition was going to be difficult as I am not tech savvy. In addition, I was worried about switching to Windows 10. The main uses for my laptop is for family photos and some word processing (letters, including the envelope!). For that purpose I have added Wordperfect -- which also included a program for spreadsheets. I am so happy with this computer. It is so easy to use and I have not had one of those moments where I wanted to pull out my hair -- which was not how it was with an android tablet I purchased not knowing any better. I am happy with my purchase.",0
"Anazing laptop so far I have had it a month no issues I play PUBG , League , fortnite and more all smooth on the highest settings and PUBG actually loads textures well. I recommend you utilize the SSD if you don’t know what it is it’s the D drive and install games there so it’s smooth sailing.",0
"Everything is great and as in the description: powerful, great keyboard, cpu/gpu - rockets, good design and shapes, except charging to full battery takes about 1.5h",0
Great system with no issues at all. Feel and run brand new. Love the low cost for a great system.,0
"Yo. My kid was like ""thanks for getting me this lap top for my birthday. For Christmas can we make it work better?""",0
"So far, after 5 weeks, I'm pleased. Item is as described... no noticeable blemishes or damage and everything works as expected.",0
"After ~2 months, I noticed a fan rattling noise when placing laptop horizontally on the desk.",0
I've had mine for a few months. So far I am loving it! It is exactly what I needed.,0
"I just received the laptop. Unfortunately, it was defective. There are gaps at the bottom of all round the chassis, and some wires are exposed. The bottom panel of the chassis doesn't seem to be the correct part for the model and small. I just requested a replacement. I hope I can update my review with a better score when I get the replacement,=== Update ===I got a replacement. The new one looks okay. At least, there are no big gaps or exposed wires.",0
My son loves me now.,0
Cool,0
"This laptop has everything you will need to game in high quality and in VR. You will definitely hear the fans especially during the Cooler Boost 5 feature. However, rest assured it will probably never get dirty inside if you game often and/or run the Cooler Boost 5 from the button on the keyboard. Some people have reported that changing out the CPU thermal paste helps keep temps down but that is risky if you haven't done this many times. Other than running a bit hot under load and very powerful fans, you won't find a better 15"" laptop for the price.",0
"Reviewing the RTX 3070 / i7-11800H / 16GB RAM / 1TB SSD model after about 6 months, purchased for roughly $1200USD.Fantastic value for the specs. Handles pretty much any game I throw at it without issue, with the performance you would expect from the given specs. As with any gaming laptop, the fans can get loud when working hard, so monitor the temperatures closely and consider wearing headphones. After 6 months, I have had no significant issues playing games or running typical software, and the temperatures are acceptable when under load.As other reviews have mentioned, the included Aorus Control Center software can be buggy. I haven't had any catastrophic issues, but it sometimes changes my fan or keyboard settings at random, especially when unplugging or plugging in the charger. You can probably remove it if you have issues, but mine have not been severe enough to warrant it.Very satisfied with the purchase so far. My only issue with the hardware is that the webcam is bottom mounted and of a poor quality; I would recommend using an aftermarket webcam if this is something you intend to use often.",0
Awesome product for the money.,0
Looks brand new and performs like it too !,0
"There was a lot to like about this machine and for a good price. To start with the main design, I'm comparing it with my 4K Dell gamer, which may sound a little unfair, but it beats the Dell in a few important places. The speed is decent, but it not superior. The i5 processor combined with the solid state hard drive, and a decent graphics processor make it workable for most games and videos. It would not be the perfect choice for 4K supported games as it's a 1080P, high definition, but not state of the art. Still even a lot of the highest end gamer laptops do not support 4K yet, so for the price 1080P resolution is very good.Case has solid feel to it and seems well designed on bottom and back to expel heat. I like the design of the pivot for the screen better than my Dell because the screen on my Dell tents to stress the screen when moved into position. The center attachment does not work as well as the Acer, dual end attachments. Another plus is the whole unit is slightly lighter and almost an inch shorter than the Dell, although the screen view size is the same. The difference comes what there is a larger border around the Dell, the Acer still has 15.6"" of viewing area measured diagonally. Another thing I liked was the backlit keys. Very bright so I can see them. I have to squint to see the underscore key as part of my passwords and it's more difficult to see with the Dell. The keys have a little more travel than the Dell, but I like that feature as well.Set up was easy for the new user, I used the voice recognition and Cortana to go through the setup steps, it found my network and set up my email and such through Microsoft. I didn't realize that even my screensaver was ported using the MS linkage. I was surprised to see the ""Darling in the Franxx"" anime theme come up when I rebooted. I had a slight issue with trying to enter a PIN, but I think I had to check the letters and number box to allow me to access the fields. The usual trial editions of Office 360 and such were present, I didn't activate though wordpad will suffice for use as a gaming machine. I did notice although very good, there is a little lack of definition on very detailed photographic pictures, but thats expected for a non-4K.There is a Nitro App for viewing the fan speeds and processor temperature, as well as setting the battery saver parameters, and other things to monitor. Alienware has something similar, so I'm surprised the Dell gamer machine does not, but the Acer does, and it's a useful monitoring device. I sometimes wonder when my Dell gets really hot, if I could scale back on the game for a while, but I have no monitor for the actual temp or fan speeds. Another useful app is the Firefox browser is preloaded in addition to MS Edge. I've used it in the past and like it a bit better than Chrome, I use chrome on my other machine as I find Edge has some issues with some of my websites and how it interacts. I'll have to see how Firefox performs before I consider adding Chrome to the machine. Although I wasn't using any high processor use apps, I set it up on the battery alone, and in an hour it went down about 14 percent, so I still had 86 percent battery life left. My i7 Dell would have dropped in half, I know this from the occasional power outage, where I watch videos till the electric is restored. I think the Acer gives you one of the best bangs for your buck right now in laptop computing. For gamers on a budget, it's highly recommended if you need a laptop to use on the go or in multiple locations in the house.",0
"Had this laptop for about a month and its been fantastic, great performance, excellent screen and looks as good as new despite being refurbished. I was however disappointed by the Wi-Fi performance, the killer 1535 sucks. Bought an Intel Wireless AC 9260 and have zero issues with it, great performance and throughput, bluetooth is also slightly better. Not sure why this seller lists the laptop as having the Samsung PM961 when it has a Toshiba drive, read speeds are 1.8 GB/s and write 1.1 GB/s, which is pretty good. There is an interesting issue related to the XPS 13 9360 where the SSD speeds are capped because it runs the NVMe interface in power saving mode so you can't get sequential read/write speeds faster than 1.8 GB/s. Other than the few things I mentioned, solid seller with quality merchandise that has zero issues, highly recommend this laptop for people who want a good work/programming laptop",0
I purchased this item 3/9/19 and today it has completely stopped working 10/13/19. Garbage company!,0
Like it being small and easy to use.,0
Muy buena inversión,0
"You get what you pay for. It functions and does the basic necessities, but is slow and has poor audio quality (very low max volume) and poor web cam quality. Found it not that great for video calls. I default back to using my cellphone because it’s better quality. If this is what you can afford, it will get the basic stuff done.",0
GOD,0
This is a great deal & fantastic quality!,0
Very aesthetic design with the thin bezel and gold lining.,0
"Pretty Compact and packs a punch of power. I immediately upgraded the RAM to 64gb, but I am sure it would have been just as fast, though when coming design and rendering I needed this, and to be a portable solution. I have played some games with it and its amazing. It is loud, when turning on turbo fan, but its necessary for what it processes. That said I am very happy!",0
"Excellent keyboard and trackpad, some of the best I've used on a laptop. I love the crisp feeling of the keys",0
"Just general internet surfing... Not the, biggest screen but hook it up to my 49"" Amazon purchased t.v. Works fantastic!!!!",0
"I'm in love, best purchase of my life.",0
The laptop came in a nice sleek box and a nice fabric sleeve.,0
the camera is a little dissapointing given the current technologies.,0
Great condition!,0
"I bought this laptop in the hopes that it would last me for a long time. Within three months the charger cable snapped off and left the charger exposed. The screen tried to pop out and when I pushed it back in the screen cracked. Now, the entire backing of the screen is starting to crack off. I've taken good care of this laptop and it has fallen apart on me. A complete waste of my money!",0
"This HP laptop is a great choice for everyday use. The build quality is great with no issues. The screen is crisp and sharp with no dead spots. The keyboard feels good to use even after long sessions.The Intel Core i5-1235U packs enough processing power for it's intended usage, but only having 8GB of ram does bring some concern when considering long term usage. Windows 11 runs snappy and smooth with this configuration, but the drawback is you cannot upgrade the memory. This laptop as configured is more than enough power for daily task at home or at work. I did drop a star because of the inability to upgrade the memory. With that out of the way, this is a solid laptop.Games can be played on this laptop, but be mindful of the specs. This is not intended to be a gaming laptop. Yes, it can play games, but it will not compete with a dedicated gaming laptop.During long usage the bottom does heat up. It's as expected with this CPU, it's not a deal breaker. The battery life is good.I did install Ubuntu in dual boot mode. Linux runs great and everything was detected. I use Linux a lot daily along with Windows.",0
"La notebook es excelente por el precio, 600 dólares estaba, le tuve q poner más memoria y un disco más grande, la verdad q corre todos los juegos en full hd en su máxima calidad, metro exodus, control, kingdom come, flight simulator, todo fue muy bien, mínimo 30 fps . La contra es q se marca mucho y el sistema de refrigeración hace mucho ruido, es una turbina de avión. Por el resto, muy feliz",0
"Very good for internet browsing and school work. Not for gaming or any other processor/memory intensive task. Very easy to use and set up. It's also small and has a lightweight charger. I'd say it's a good deal if you're a student, have a limited knowledge of tech, or just want a small, light computer to watch videos or browse the web. There's no touch screen, but given the price I'm not complaining.",0
"Rapida, y no se friza, Me encanta!",0
La recomiendo,0
"Parecía muy buen equipo, pero no. Lo primero es que viene en una caja más grande y suelta que le permite el movimiento dentro de la misma, esto puede ser un peligro. Se calienta demasiado, se trabaja. Tenía muy buenos comentarios sobre ella, de todas maneras puedo mi cambio por otra, espero no decepcionarme de nuevo. Pues si parece un buen equipo. Daré mi opinión en el segundo.",0
the battery life is somewhat poor even during normal work,0
Muy cómoda y liviana para transportar,0
anything intensive will see much worse battery life,0
"I felt compelled to write a review for this amazing laptop. I used to use an Acer Predator, and this is cheaper and far superior. It's lightning fast, amazing image quality, doesn't get hot, and has a respectable battery life. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a new laptop.",0
Very nice,0
"when i first opened the box, you get 2 extra goodies- a carrying sleeve and an optical mouse!",0
Replacement same issue not charging,0
I have another bigger screen Swift 5. This one is smaller and heavier..,0
"This little computer Rocks!! Super fast and does everything I need it to do, and I have a job in the tech industry so, ya.",0
"It turns out ""HD"" no longer means high definition. This POS screen is 720 not 1080. i returned it.",0
"I got this as an extra computer to use at work (light use-checking emails, etc) . I like that the screen is large. It is quite heavy, which I don't really mind. It gets kind of glitchy at times, especially when more than one web page is open at the same time (I don't even mind that) . Battery life is amazing. The reason for the 2 stars is the screen resolution. The very first smartphones that came out had better resolution than this screen. I realize you'll get less screen resolution because of the price of this laptop, but this was horrible. Makes it very hard to see without squinting and adjusting the screen all the time, which also doesn't help much.",0
So far so good with the computer. Easy to set up. Works for fortnite and roblox. My kids are extremely happy. Had an issue with the sound not working. The computer needed to update and the sound worked.,0
This was a waste of money. It is very restricted and restricting. It locks the Usenet into chrome etc.,0
The whole keyboard operates smoothly and I like that the mouse pad,0
"Powerful gami laptop, expect to run almost everything at medium and up settings. But expect it heating on the right side of keyboard, cooling system is decent. Temperature never goes up more than 75°C.",0
"This is a nice laptop, and I am not even a gamer. I bought a Playstation 4 just for console gaming only.I agree with other reviewers that the build quality of this laptop is not good. It's not just because it is made out of plastic. There are metal bars on the left side and right side of the keyboard which bend very easily when picking up the laptop. The computer itself looks crooked if these bars bend, so you always have to pick up the laptop with two hands (left and right sides) and try to bend them straight to keep the laptop straight. You shouldn't have to do this on a laptop.The trackpad on my laptop was unfortunately defective. It clicked well on the left side. However, on the right side, it made a loud rattling sound when tapping to click. Pressing the trackpad down all the way to click worked. However, the rattling sound was distracting while using the computer. It is similar to the defective trackpads found in Dell XPS 15 9500 where users described a wobble or looseness in the trackpad. The trackpad also made loud popping sounds by simply gliding your finger from the right side to the left side (no clicking down).Don't get me wrong, it is still a great computer. I think if you are going to use an external USB mouse, then this will not affect you. Working from home with this computer required a good trackpad, so I was a little disappointed.",0
"For the money this is an excellent computer for home, plenty fast enough.",0
"Don't buy save your money! The color resolution is garbage. The color black will show as grey, the color white will show as cream and the color brown will show as blue! Also the left speaker does not work either. Second time buying an Acer laptop and for both laptops neither left speakers worked!",0
"MSI customer support is a sham. Left side cooling fan seized after 3 months of use. Contacted support and they want $20 to send a replacement fan that will take 1 month to arrive, but the replacement fan on Amazon is $12 prime. This is a complete waste of money. I should have stayed with my ASUS ROG.",0
Just As I expected,0
"Love this computer! Everything loads quickly, no lags, and I like the tablet option.",0
"This was a purchase I looked forward to arriving at my door. Unfortunately this is the worst computer acquisition I have made during 30 years of owning computers and close to 25 years of owning laptops. The keyboard is a very large disappointment in that it is needlessly small keyboard with considerably more potential real estate for keys on the existing board and the keystroke is far too shallow, feeling like you are typing on a cheap game controller. I kept the computer for a week trying to become accustomed to it but can't stand it. It is the first computer I have and am considering returning. Don't waste your time and money without finding one of these in a store and checking it out. TERRIBLE keyboard. I am a developer and would be spending quite a bit of time on this kid keyboard. Can't even consider it.",0
"This is a fantastic laptop! After driving myself crazy researching Windows Laptops (I've owned Apple products all my life) I just pulled the trigger and bought this. I have been fully satisfied with my purchase so far! It's very light, the screen is great, the keyboard is a perfect size, and it's lightning fast to boot up. I will be using graphic design software on it and I think it will be sufficiently powerful for that and everything else I need it for.",0
"I need to correct my review of this product. My previous negative view was based on Fedora23. Now, after half year of testing different operating systems, I finally found the Fedora25 of Nov, 2016, stable enough!!! I just watched the old spider man 2 movie for 1 hour straight and no problems at all! You have to use Fedora 25 if you scrap the chrome OS.vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvIt's very sad that I can not give 5 stars to a chromebook. I used to give all other chromebooks 5 stars. Many people complain about the wifi disconnect. I have tried removing the wifi module in this chromebook, but the system still hangs after a few hours of use, sometimes even shorter. I have tried to patch the BIOS so that I can install a full Fedora23 desktop.And it still hangs frequently in Fedora23. So, the problem is in the BIOS , not in Chrome OS.",0
Everything great fast delivery all round happy customer!!!!,0
"Brought this lab top for my grandson for college and it really a nice computer,and I got it on sell.",0
Very thin and easy to carry around,0
"Read the specs and you will see, it is a windows11 pro. well i got a windows 10 pro. now i need to find out why.",0
"I like the I/O on this laptop. there are plenty of options. I was looking at another competitive product but the ports were lacking compared to this, it had the last generation AMD ZEN2 cpu, onboard AMD graphics, smaller less bright lower refresh screen, and was about $200 cheaper. This is heavier, but there is so much more there for the money.",0
I received defective product.I return this item,0
Ordered this for our grand daughter. Keeps thanking us for it. Our daughter says it works great for school and home,0
Muy bueno,0
"This laptop actually lives up to all the hype about the M1 chip and such. It is lightning fast, smooth, clear easy to read screen and the battery lasts and lasts for all day and then some. Also I have noticed that with any normal use it doesn't even get warm so the lack of a fan is not a detriment but nice as a nonexistent fan can't make any noise. I was slightly skeptical but as a multiple APPLE owner not surprised I was happy. Seriously I just sent a 3 year old iPad that had been used hard daily for a battery replacement and received a brand new iPad 3 days after I sent it in. Thats service as well.",0
"Great Laptop by the battery life is extremely terrible even for a gaming laptop, you go from 100-30 in less 40-30 minutes.",0
Gets fairly hot with gaming and battery life is not great,0
Purchase laptop to run zoom finding difficulty with audio,0
Love this little computer. It it light weight and very fast upon start up. Battery lasts for 6 or 7 hrs. My only complaint is that I wish that it had a number pad otherwise no problems.,0
The 144Hz 300nits IPS display is great. Great for gaming even though the battery is not as good. The RTX 2070 also means that you can game on it on Ultra settings for years to come. I don't think you can this GPU at a cheaper price when it comes to laptops. I really love this laptop so far. The only downside is the battery life. Use it only when plugged in.,0
"I ordered the 2017 Samsung laptop model but they shipped the newer 2018 model. I wanted the 2017 because I had already read the newer one''s screen wasn't as bright and had tried out a 2017 at a BxxxBxx store a couple months earlier, and YUP, it is true. In the course of dealing w/ Amazon to ""exchange"" the 2018 model for the one I actually ordered, the price went up considerably on the older (and better reviewed) model, so I kept the 2018. It's ""okay"" for what I need, but not nearly as good as my old Samsung 2nd generation, which I still use but now has to be tethered full-time to the cord--so not too portable anymore...",0
Buen producto muy práctica rápida,0
"This is not a touch screen computer - it states that it is in the description, but it is not.",0
"I absolutely loved this laptop for the price you can not beat it, it has a up to date processors, good memory and it’s fast with many ports. And it comes with window 10, it’s a great brand I would recommend this to any college student, perfect for college",0
"I love this laptop beause it is low priced with very advanved hardware and also has a sleek look to it, I can play games at 100+ fps consistently and also allows mr to take care of my work/daily needs, overrall this comeupter is fulfilling what I wanted it tto do and more I would reccoemnd buying this if looking for a Low Priced but high capacity laptop.",0
Laptop exceeds my expectations for a laptop. It runs every program that i need it to and start up is fast.,0
I purchased this laptop a few months ago and so far so good. I love it! I have to get used to the Microsoft part of it but all in all it's been a great laptop for a great price.,0
Best laptop,0
"whatever rubberized finish they placed for the wrist-rest, and the vents directly above the CPU/GPU",0
"So far, so good. I love my little chrome book. Perfect for my purposes.",0
The graphics card speaks for itself in many ways and lives up to the expectation,0
Very happy.,0
"I am very disappointed to have to write this review. Even more disappointed that I am going to have to return this laptop. On the positive side, this machine is beautiful, light, and the performance is fantastic. On the negative side, the build quality is less than I would expect at this price range (compared to others in the market). On the “this is unacceptable” side, the fan is extremely loud! At minimal load, you can hear the fan, which is surprising. If the machine goes above 20% of RAM or CPU usage, the fan ramps up and sounds like a landscaper is trying to escape from the laptop. It is atrocious! It happens every time I open a video call. 80% of my workload is video calls, making this machine unusable. Man, I am super bummed about this machine.",0
Under load it gets pretty loud you will be able to hear it across the living room.,0
Purchased on August 1. Received August 6. Battery on October 21 will not hold a charge. Must have computer plugged in at all times or it powers off instantly. Hoping to get a battery replacement but the sellers phone number is constantly busy.,0
"Great battery life, don't expect this to be top of the line, but the best bang for your buck by far. Stream hd, check email, browse the web (90 percent of the stuff I do) it's absolutely perfect. Ended up having to get more ram for web design but this is my personal laptop for hanging out at home. Great but for the price, literally runs for 13 hours without a charge.",0
real easy to travel with super light,0
"The RGB lightning on this looks really good, the keyboard feels great.",0
"Dead on arrival, amazon support is not helpful",0
It arrived fast and works perfect out of the box. Worth the money. It wont disappoint. Upgrade the ram and itll be a bit better. Ahem less than a year and the fans click so loud about to drown this machine in the tub....,0
"I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this is a big ticket item for most people.I have nothing bad to say regarding the particular XPS 9500 unit I received with a couple of caveats...The Bad:Similar to other reviewers, I suspect this product is not ""NEW"" as described but rather returned and/or refurbished. It came in a rather torn up box which was simply sealed with regular packing tape. It was shipped to Amazon from a company that appears to be an authorized reseller/or refurbishing center as far as I could tell from a quick Google search. The box had certainly been around the block a time or two, LOL.Given the price point and specs, I'm not surprised if it is a ""refurb, open box, return, etc."" I'm only surprised that Amazon sells them at a steep discount but describes as ""NEW"". I could be way off base here, and perhaps Dell ships most of their products in beat up boxes, and I'm just unaware of it.The Good:I know the above sounded very critical, but bear with me. Once I opened the outer box, the inner Dell box was pristine. Everything was nicely packaged and appeared brand new. The usual protective plastic peel off, unwrap, etc. stuff was all there on everything. There wasn't a fingerprint or speck of dust to be found. Even smelled ""like new"". So...I figured I'd give it a go. Set it up and everything seemed fine, so I opened it up and upgraded memory to 64gb. Everything internally looked new to my untrained eye as well. I've been using it for several days with no issues. Overall, I personally am happy for the price, but if these aren't truly ""new"", I think description should reflect that.Considerations:My laptop before this one was an XPS 15 2012 or 2013 model. It originally had Windows 8 on it FWIW. I had upgraded to SSD, switched to Win10, maxed out RAM, and replaced battery over the years...Just so you know my basis for comparison.Other reviews on both Amazon and online mention crackling speakers and faulty trackpads with this model. My experience has been that speakers sound as good as any laptop I've ever heard, and trackpad is slightly less sensitive in top corners but otherwise fine (I never would have noticed trackpad thing except for online reviews had me looking for faults.) I personally find the speakers and trackpad perfectly fine. Another criticism has been loud fan noise when laptop is trying to cool. It doesn't bother me because my old XPS sounds like a turbo spooling up when it's under a load too! Maybe other brands are quieter, IDK. Fan noise wasn't a big concern of mine.Perhaps mine was a return/refurb that had faults addressed, I just got lucky and got a good unit, or the faults aren't as bad as they are made out to be with this model. I can't say for certain, but that's my experience thus far and honest review.",0
"Overall this is a good laptop, I use it as my daily driver + some light gaming, and everything is smooth. You can feel very little warm above the keyboard area when watching live stream or gaming in auto mode and the fan noise is low, I would say the thermal is good. Battery life is about 4 hours when watching live stream.Pros:1. Nice build quality and clean look.2. Has a num pad.3. Screen is decent.4. RAM & SSD are easily upgradable + secondary SSD slot is available.5. Fast CPU, decent thermal, and low fan noise.6. Power & most of I/O ports are at the back, and there is one USB port at both sides.Cons:1. Need some time to get used to the keyboard. I kept hitting the num pad when trying to hit the back space.2. Location of e-support sticker at the left palm resting area can be annoying.3. Could be heavy for some people.4. GPU is not the latest & greatest if you are looking for RTX.",0
"Just got the computer last night. Seems pretty good besides one small, but very often used feature: the speakers. They're so quite and so poor. If you've ever got a keychain bluetooth speaker as a RiteAid impulse buy for $8, you've gotten better sound than this computer. Ugh... is deleting all my already imputed info, then boxing it up, printing a label, and shipping it back worth the lack of speaker quality... Just maybe!!",0
Amazing laptop,0
"I use this ASUS VivoBook 15"" Laptop for Music Production with an attached 250gb External SSD Samsung EVO Drive, and as you can see, it is PERFECT. I would definitely recommend this Computer, just get the 8gb RAM, not the 4gb.",0
this laptop exceeded my expectations and is definitely worth the price.,0
Perfect for work!!,0
Its a pretty good laptop so far. Reloading (to get rid of the Bloat...) seems to take a really long time but that is windows and not a hit on the laptop. So far its nice for the price....and the DVD...its real not fake....so who ever said that was full of it.,0
"I wish that the item description had a disclosure about the statement for the State of California which is ""May content chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm'' Has good speakers, the screen really doesn't glare. But it contents lead (battery)",0
Better than I thought,0
"A few days in and I really enjoy it. The mouse TouchPad is a little weird to me but I bout a USB mouse, and it works fine.",0
Battery life is a bit small but I got it for 500. Awesome value.,0
"Best laptop for me, everything is good.",0
"I purchased this laptop in May 2019 and I have used it for works (mostly on chrome, word, excel, 8h per day) and little gaming (League of Legends, about 1h30 per day) in 1 month before writing this review:- My laptop is brand new and sealed- Speed: not fast as I expected but still fast enough to work. 5 to 6s to turn on, about 2s to open excel/ word, but if I want to open big excel file some times I have to wait to 10 or 15s. In my opinion I think it is not faster than my old laptop Asus G551JW (8gb ram, core i7 4720HQ), but maybe the Asus is a gaming laptop and it has HQ CPU so it will be faster than an energy saving CPU on this Dell XPS.- Screen: Amazing. I dont want to come back to a full hd screen anymore. The recommended scales is 300% but when I work on Excel, I can see too few rows and columns (look at the attachment picture), so I changed to 250% and I think it is the perfect scale for this laptop. The screen is good for movies too.- Battery: I can use the laptop about 10h per day (8h at work and about 1h30 to play League of Legends) with a full charge. When I work: the screen light is 50%, speaker is 50%. When I play games: screen light: 80 or 100%, speaker: 80%. The battery life may vary depending on the way you use the laptop. For me 10h/ charge is enough.- Speaker: Loud and clear but if you want to enjoy high quality music, pls find a headphone or a speaker- Finger print reader: Fast and convenient.- Temperature: my laptop is a little warm when you work for long time but it is still acceptable, not hot.- Fan: I hate the fan because it's really noisy and annoying. Lucky that the fan rarely works and never works if you use laptop in an air-conditioned room.- Excel: I mainly work on Excel, but some times the laptop opens the file but I cant edit or read the contents, I have to reopen it and the problem ends. I hope the problem will be solved after some windows update.- Gaming: I play League of Legends on 4k resolution, 30 to 40fps; or 60 to 100fps on full hd resolution. The game is smooth but I still think the laptop is not build for games, it is only a replacement for your desktop PC when you are traveling. I have to adjust screen light to 80% or 100% when I play the game, the laptop get warm when I play.- Keyboard: good for typing, bad for gaming. Layout is small but quite easy to get used to- Touch screen: much better than most laptops I have used (I havent used Macbook so I cant compare, just my opinion). Now I dont use mouse any more (except playing games), just touch pad + touch screen.I rate it 4/5 because of the fan and excel experience. The laptop is good for me and worths the price (I bought it from 1 seller in May, $1200). Hope my review can help you.",0
"So i bought this item in October of 2018 for my 13 year old daughter who""s birthday is on the 25th December ... she was excited and enjoying the use of this product. Then exactly 3months later it stop working , it is not powering up and i'm so upset wondering if i spent my monies in vein....any way i ordered a new charger for it and i'm awaiting its delivery to see if the problem is the charger why it wont power up.",0
"Useless as a portable laptop. Battery discharges while its off, even when I charge it and it shows like 70% battery life left, it plummets to 0% and shuts down. Never held for more than two hours. Garbage.UPDATE: Ordered a new battery and it works much better. Still slight discharge when turned off. Known issue with all Lenovo laptops.",0
"Ordered this computer and was very excited to receive it. As soon as I opened it up and powered it on, I discovered a broken screen. There was a large red line that ran up and down on the right portion of the screen and a chip in the bottom portion of the screen. Very unhappy to receive a damaged product. Sent it back and ordered a new one. Has anyone else had this same issue?",0
"I liked this laptop because it has good fan system despite that it is loud. Everyone knows that fan systems of gaming laptops are louder than other laptops. It is normal. In addition, i can play every game which i want in high graphics. NVMe SSD makes this laptop very faster. That's all if you want to buy this laptop, think about loud fan system.",0
budget option for gaming,0
Muy potente y buenisima bateria y acabado premium,0
"So far (a few days), I am very satisfied with the laptop as it met my expectations. In my opinion, the main advantages are:-It is very fast-It has an excellent display and audio-Comfortable keyboard-It has the perfect screen size for an everyday laptop-You can upgrade SSD memoryIt is important to mention that I normally use it to browse the internet, watch on-demand services like Prime-Video, store photos and videos, and perform basic tasks in programs like Word, Excel, etc.The only downsides I have observed are:-The quality of the camera is not the best during video calls.-You can quickly see your fingerprints on it, so it can get dirty pretty fast.None of the downsides bother me personally, but I consider it important to mention.In conclusion, it is a great laptop at a reasonable price.",0
"Took forever to ship and get in.Had screen issues such as pixel discoloration and dead spots while gaming the first few days I had it. Fast forward to now and I only have a light up keyboard, no power to mouse, and a dead screen. Really bummer it didn't work well considering the specs and hardware this thing has.",0
"I needed a cheap laptop to install Kali on. This fits the bill but I had to fight with it to turn off bitlocker, disable the TPM and jettison Windows 11.I wish HP put more usb ports on it because two is not enough. It really should have an ethernet port too but, at least it was cheap. Fortunately usb hubs are cheap and readily available.",0
"I got this lap top because I needed a unit to practice Powershell scripting. It has done that and more! Quick to boot, plenty of speed, no bloat ware. Exactly what I needed.Thanks!",0
It came with an illegal edition of what was represented.,0
"I Recently bought one and one time started acting up and not turning on for no obvious reason. Aside from that, so far it’s been good.",0
"This is a great laptop, especially for the price. The backlit keyboard is a nice function, and it can be set to stay lit, just fire up NitroSense and click the gear icon in top right corner for settings.You will def need more storage space, can get 1tb externals pretty cheap now days. Everything worked great right out of the box.My only disappointment was that I bought a docking station to run multiple displays through the usb-c port. But that port doesnt support video I found out. You can still run another display through the hdmi port though, so its just a minor disappointment.All in all for the price, its awesome. Has run everything I've thrown at it and its quick too.",0
"1. The components are excellent - 16GB RAM @ 3200 MHz, 512GB NVMe SSD, 1660TI, Ryzen 4800H.2. The cooling solution is phenomenal. Giant air vents behind/below/left/right of the laptop blow out a ton of hot air. Even when the Ryzen 4800H was at max turbo speed playing XCOM 2, the CPU temperature barely exceeded 80C.3. The display is 144HZ, and its purdy. Bright screen, vibrant colors, and the gray-to-gray response time feels good too (no noticeable ghosting).4. I dig the blocky, low-key aesthetic. Nothing on this laptop screams ""edgy 12 year old,"" (besides the name ""Legion,"" which I guess is still better than having ""Predator"" or ""Republic of Gamers"" stamped on your laptop).5. It's heavier than a macbook air, but it doesn't feel unwieldy in your hands. And it go fast and cool.Learned a way to modify the registry editor to unlock a hidden power plan that prevents the Ryzen 4800H from ever going above its 2.9GHz base clock, and it's amazing. I'm hitting the same FPS on games because the GPU has more thermal headroom, and my CPU temp dropped from 80C to 60C.Haven't used this thing on battery yet, but from what I've heard it isn't great. Hoping capping the CPU speed at baseclock will help, but you don't get a gaming laptop to play on the battery anyhow.If you're looking for a gaming laptop to buy, this is the one to get.",0
I like the keyboard design.,0
the battery does not last more than a couple hours under heavy game use.,0
"This laptop is pretty solid, carrying it and the charger around to and from class haven't been much of a problem.",0
"I've had at least half a dozen mac laptops and as a non-pro the air is just what I needed. I replaced a Macbook Pro with the touch bar, the only Mac I've had which failed on me, and when I saw the price of new Macbook Pros I about fainted. I don't do graphics or video, I don't play games, I figured I'd just try the basic Macbook Air and see if it was fast enough. Bingo, it's great. New M1 processor is plenty for web surfing, daily use of the full MS Office suite with multiple windows open at the same time, video streaming etc. Battery life is terrific, I can work all day on a single charge! Sure there are people who need a ""Pro"" device but for the vast majority of us, even heavy daily usage, this is a spectacular computer.",0
Tablets just seem so much easier,0
Computer froze and made a loud constant noise so I shut it down manually.,0
"The system performs quite well and easily handles any game I have tried to play on it. The battery performance during gaming isn't great, but 144hz refresh rate and power consumption of the video card during gaming does whittle the battery performance down fairly quickly. However when used for school and maxed out for battery performance, to include restricting to a 60hz refresh rate, the system easily lasts and entire day at school for my son without needing to be plugged in to recharge.",0
I don't especially like is the placement of the power button on the keyboard as if it was just another key.,0
"This is a very solid laptop, designed to be a thin and light laptop for gaming.",0
the fan is chattering so loudly that it's become an issue just being obnoxious broken sounds,0
Si tienes o logras una tarjeta de Amazon puedes pagar mensualmente una mínima cantidad y compras una macbook que aunque no es de pantalla táctil es de excelente calidad.,0
"So its really grating that products such as this do not list the BASE processing speed. If it automatically ""boosts"" when u start up a game, it only makes it so you can technically run that game. It takes a while to load it up (we are talking just sims 3 here too!) and fps is 30 max. Idk the actual base ghz but others have said 1.0 something. Cant do anything with that. Just using the internet is slow as well. Just because all the pieces are there, doesnt mean they actually cohesively work together. It seemed like such a cool laptop but just wasnt working very well.",0
No parental controls. Had to return.,0
"La compre en noviembre y ya me está dando problemas, al parecer no funciona la memoria ram, no se me ha caído ni golpeado.. y ahora 😭?? Estoy en Guayaquil-Ecuador",0
"The speakers are located on the bottom underneath of the laptop so if its on your lap, they get muffled.",0
When we received the laptop it was well packaged and very impressive looking. When powered up however the screen did not work. As if there was no back lighting. If you shine a light on the screen you could see that there was in fact something on it but it was too dark to see and the brightness did not adjust. Asus warranty was quick to resolve this and fix it at no charge. Now it’s up and running perfectly. So fast! The colorful RGB lights just set the whole thing off. Awesome looking. The camera quality is fantastic as well. This is great for gaming or for gaming working when I need multiple processes running at once. I’m very happy with it and it’s exactly what I would expect in a gaming laptop at this price point.,0
I love this Laptop.,0
Use it for personal/business use,0
"I believe i've found my unicorn because this particular macbook air still lasts an insane amount of time! Although i don't use it on full brightness, i regulate it a lot. Connecting several devices to it via bluetooth is transparent, but unfortunately, Apple made the macOS more inconvenient to handle in terms of simplicity.User experience on the macOS is weird, you know as a mac user where things used to be, then you have to relearn some things and it doesn't feel like home, the new normal isn't good so far.Keyboard is relatively quiet, also, there's the missing keyboard light on this iteration of the macbook air, why did you take (probably) the most useful key from us?! if you're watching a movie you have to literally stop the movie, go through the menu from above and turn off the keyboard lights, or if you're on a presentation and everything is dark, you just turn your screen light down but you can't with your keyboard because you need to actually stop paying attention to the presentation and go through the menu, inconvenient as heck!I know (and i'm very well aware) that there are some workarounds to change to the keyboard light again using a small software... but that isn't the end-game, the thing is that we shouldn't need an extra software or aditional configuration just to use something the macbook had for, literally, over 10 years!Speed on this macbook: you don't even feel it... everything is instant, nothing is slow, if something is, it's most likely the software or the website you're on, is that simple! If you're planning on using massive storage, you should use an usb-c one, not an usb-a through usb-c dongle, you will have a bottleneck, that's guaranteed.I haven't used it on games because that's why i have my pc and xbox for. However, if you're planning on developing software on it, just make sure your libraries fit within 228gb (the half of it is recommended for all ssd's) of storage, if that's gonna be an issue, then go for usb-c massive storage.Weight isn't a problem, it makes you feel like you're having a premium laptop on your hands, but not enough to make your bag heavier. Construction feels like you own something premium and well-made.",0
Its a bit heavy but i love carrying this around to use . The fan is loud but if you don't mind the loudness of it then it you wont really care about it.,0
Very good!,0
the stylus pen was not included in my order.. What happened??,0
Love this laptop it's super fast and loads faster then any previous computers I've ever had. It's a great buy.,0
My computer just keeps crash now and only boots into BOS after having it for 4 years,0
"I bought it because I wanted a very fast laptop for work and everyday activities... that I could take on vacations and play games if I wanted. It handles Sea of Thieves on Mythical graphics no problem. Love the laptop, worth the money...Only issue, I had to get a replacement the first week or so. Because it wouldn’t let me install games from the Microsoft Store to my hard drive. It acted like it didn’t exist. I even reinstalled the OS.So I just sent it back and got a replacement (within 30 days) so I highly recommend making sure it can download games and do everything you want while in your Amazon return window.Side note- will definitely buy more high valued items on Amazon due to their quick shipment of my new laptop.",0
"Es bastante rápida, no se calienta y puedes jugar a juegos básicos con ella. Pensé que no me gustaría el color y el dise?o pero está bastante bien.",0

"Excellent for gaming.Battery life decent, but the laptop is to powerful for only battery so is acceptable.No built-in camera, no problem for me i never use it anyway.BUT there's a bug. IDK whether is software or hardware.THE TOUCHPAD IS NOT WORKING RIGHT.I updated the drivers.Reinstall them.Nothing.It stops working just because.And suddenly it starts working again.And it keeps doing that.I just use a mouse.I don't want to return it and wait another month.",0
I am totally in love with the laptop!! It works perfectly!! The quality of the Laptop is amazing.,0
"I've only been using this laptop for about a month but so far so good. I love that it's connected with my Google info on my phone so it's easy to share files and images. The battery lasts for such a long time, and it's light and compact. Perfect for my kids too use as well.",0
It fairly light weight with a fairly small power adapter.,0
Bought this laptop for a friend who goes to college. Upon using it for a couple weeks they said they liked it and it was super fast. They had no issues or hiccups since then. Laptop is great for simple work like homework browsing the web checking emails. I wouldn't recommend this laptop for any type of heavy gaming. All in all this laptop is great for everyday light use.,0
Purchased this for my mother. She loves it! Screen is clear and easy for her to use.,0
"I ordered this Laptop on a Friday and it was delivered promptly on Monday morning. For the. price this laptop is excellent: easy set up, item is as described. Only thing missing was a manual but that was remedied by going to the website with any questions I had.Good service by Fulfillment.",0
"So far this is a pretty amazing laptop. You can't really ask for much more, except for maybe a touchpad screen.",0
"Whish it let me replace the hard drive with a 128 SSD, but my biggest wish is a 15 inch 1080 screen. I think all Chromebooks should come with a 14 or 15 inch screen and a 720 or 1080 camera and 8 gigs of fast memory to support hangout's Video Chats.",0
"This Chromebook has no delete key.How in the world can a computer have no delete key?It will not allow for any widgits to show on the screen, and any bookmarked items only show on the top bar.How to delete them? Who knows, since there is no delete key!Maybe, just maybe I missed something.But the ""manual"" is just a few pages long and tells you absolutely nothing.The tutorial is worse.I'd return it, but now I can't DELETE any of my info.Target practice tomorrow.",0
"Got the laptop and everything worked like a charm. Others have said that the CPU runs hot and needs to put the fans on blast always and as I'm writing this review the fans are going fairly crazy. During light gaming it feels like it overheats a bit. During heavy gaming it gets pretty hot.Biggest complaint is with the keyboard. It looks like it was designed by someone who never takes their right hand off of the mouse. It's great for gaming, but awful for programming. Just noticed the numpad page down/up and home/end so hopefully that makes things better, but for such a large laptop it's a bit confusing why they wouldn't have a full keyboard layout. Then to waste an entire key on * / + - seems a bit upsetting to me. Also the arrow keys location is scrunched up in there.Very happy with the laptop, don't get me wrong. But, come to terms with the keyboard first and I think your experience will be better. Also, to ASUS...come on guys get this figured out.",0
Looks good. Good deal for the price. S-mode can be upgraded to Windows 10 home with no costs,0
"Primero que nada es una laptop excelente y más al precio que la compre, me costo $699 directo de Amazon.Venia solamente con 8gb de ram así que le compre un modulo extra de 8gb y va perfecto con 16gb de ram. su pantalla de 17 pulgadas es perfecta para hacer edición de video y jugar a videojuegos. sin duda alguna la recomiendo al 100%.Por cierto en la descripción del producto no lo dice pero también cuenta con un puerto Thunderbolt.",0
"bastante buena, la duración de la batería no ha sido conforme a mis expectativas. En la oferta indicaba que la duración de la batería era de 8hrs de uso, no llega al 50%...",0
This MSI laptop has been great so far! It is fast and will handle most games at ease that you will throw at it. It runs cool and the fans are much quieter compared to my old gaming laptop. The full size keyboard is great and the RGB lights are really cool. But.. the battery life! It's not as described. I got less than 3 hours of mixed use before I had to plug it in.,0
"The design is superb, very stylish and eye-grabbing, without being tacky",0
"I bought this laptop two months ago and I wanted to wait a bit before to give my opinion. I am a student so I have not so much expectation about games, I prefer to warn. I am very happy with this laptop. First the weight is among the smaller. I take it every day and I'm happy that my back will not be destroyed at the end of my university time. Second, the screen is matte! I was a little bit afraid when I ordered it because I was not absolutely sure of that, but is is! When you write all the day long and watch many things for your work, it save your eyes! The bezels are very thin and I'm not disturb by the size, although I was used to work on a 15"".My only concern is the pad. many times, the pointer is blocked. I saw on internet that pressing Ctrl help but it bothers me. So I have a wireless mouse and I use it as much as possible. If I have time, I will add some other comments.",0
Me agrado mucho la Rapides de envio y la Calida del equipo.,0
"Wi-Fi wack-a-mole, fix one problem and another pops up, the only game you get to play with this gaming laptop is to figure out why Wi-Fi is not working today, and then repeat tomorrow. If I wanted to be tethered to the internet via Ethernet I would have just got another desktop. Very disappointed in poor performance of a so-called gaming laptop.",0
Love this as work from home laptop. Screen is great size.,0
"La verdad me gusto mucho, cumplió todas mis expectativas y esta muy lindo y de muy buena calidad",0
"We have it on a gaming stand with a fan, and reinstalled to factory settings. But having frequent shut off/restart issues that do not seem to get solved with any of the google searched fixes. Just past the return window, so will need to contact Lenovo.",0

I bought this for my son and he uses it daily! We've had no issues with it. Great product!,0
"Camera was completely absent. Several pixels died out in the first 6 months. Fan is incredibly erratic. It will go at 100% for no reason then not run during hard performance. Configurations don't help, sadly. Just a pack of really bad quality control issues. If you purchase this thing, prepare to deal with an incredibly annoying return process and time without a computer to deal with the issues.",0
It runs games really good. But if I flip it over I literally can cook eggs on the bottom of it. I’m scared it will break because it is running so hot. Is that normal?,0
"I really love this laptop, I found it fast, light and its design is just so elegant!",0
Nice laptopThanks,0
"Got this for my son for his birthday and Christmas. got this for school work and it is faster than my laptop.

"First time purchasing an Asus laptop. I'm used to a more sharp looking screen with better graphics on the games I play. Battery life isn't that great; only 3 hours compared to other laptops I've previously owned.The laptop runs cool; never overheats. I thought having a dual fan would be noisy, boy was I wrong! The speakers are one of the best features on this laptop by far. It's almost comparable to a Bose feel where the sound surrounds the room. There's only one major concern with this laptop and I'm sure it's just a cosmetic defect on the manufactures end. I can't get over a small raised bump on the touch pad itself. I've tried to scratch it down to no avail. It's incredibly difficult to ignore.This issue can be avoided with purchasing a mouse on the side. The laptop is very light and has a nice appeal to it. I feel for the price point you're getting a decent value. If you spend a bit more you can have a far better version of this laptop.Edit: Unfortunately I'm starting to hear the fans and the laptop itself getting hotter as weeks go by. I'm unsure why this is happening. The keys are even hot to the touch; this was never an issue before. :( I've taken off a star..",0
"The m1 MacBook Air is the perfect machine blending the best aspects of cell phone computing with the functionality of a laptop. This means unparalleled performance, amazing battery life, and beautiful screen quality. Along with these improvements the keyboard is also refined and no longer used the dreaded scissor mechanism.

Fantastic build quality with a clean CNC Aluminium structure and finish.,0
"I should probably give this five stars, because for the price I love it. It's reasonably speedy if not fast, has a reasonably clear, sharp screen, and is sturdy. I used this in Europe when I didn't want to dare expose my Macbook to travel. It did the job. My one quibble is that the charger hole is a little loose sometimes.",0

"I'll start by saying EVERYTHING but the performance of this laptop is great. I purchased this laptop at at the end of August and it was shipped to my wife in September. I am currently deployed in Eastern Europe with the Army so she shipped it to me. Upon receiving it in October, I noticed from day one the the performance of this laptop was no where near what it should be. I tried everything, to include obvious windows updates, driver updates, bios updates, game updates, etc but none of them worked. I always keep the laptop up to date on everything except for when I try reverting back to older versions. I cant even play games on low settings despite this laptop having the best specs of laptops on the market. I have deleted and re-downloaded games and updates to make sure its not the games and every time it wont work. The problem I am encountering is the laptop randomly lags out of video games every time I try to play. When it does let me play (before lagging out) my FPS rubberbands terribly between 6 and 100 or-so FPS. This is unplayable. the reason I know something must be wrong with the laptop is my previous laptop, which was not a gaming laptop, ran video games better than this one does. I have not once had the experience that youtube reviews have showed of getting 200+ fps in games. I wouldn't even be upset if I just got 100fps in games, but I literally cannot even play before it kicks me out. many times it is the first game after turning it on that it kicks me out of games and continues lagging out after that. Other times its every 5 or so games of rocket league, or every game or two of Warzone or Battlefield 2042. I am deployed away from my family and friends for a year and playing video games was supposed to be the one release from this mess here but I cannot even do that. I believe I probably just received a lemon but it has ruined the gaming laptop experience for me. Hopefully the seller can help resolve this issue",0
Works great! Fast shipping too!,0
"Bought for my husband after his other asus only lasted 18mths. I was skeptical to say the least, but this was what he wanted. Aside from the volume being horrible, it appears to be working just fine. We’re only 2mths into it so I’m still very cautious.",0

"Where to begin with the ROG Strix GL703VM Scar Edition?It is feature rich and the components are solid:i7-7700HQ Quad Core Laptop @2.8GHz16 GB of RAMNVidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB)256 GB SSD (Mine happens to be a Hynix)1TB 7200RPM Hard Drive17.3"" 1080p 120Hz monitorNow the paper specs are great and the laptop is much thinner than previous generations (I personally went from a G750JM). It runs all number of applications flawlessly and is a bit more than a laptop for general, everyday, use.The only con that I have on this model is that it runs warm, even in idle actions. The keyboard will absorb some of this heat, so during use, you can certainly feel a quadrant of keys that are more warm than others. It isn't a major issue and can certainly still run phenomenally.(Edit: After much trouble, I will return this because the device gets a bit too warm. Using on a table, the laptop under load will reach 80C, which would be fine, if it didn't cause the keyboard to stop functioning or the whole laptop to reboot. For a gaming laptop to be unable to play for an hour without it crashing in FF14 on Laptop settings is a bit concerning.)",0

Bought for my 11 year old. Would have bought at Best Buy if they had any customer service. Does everything he needs.,0
the camera is not only in the lower right of the screen,0
"Anda genial, tanto para trabajo como para juegos",0
"Sturdy construction vs. my 3 year old Asus which didn't hold up well. Unfortunately,the battery/time left reporting system was inadequate even after I sent it out for service and they replaced the motherboard . If their C'book reports 100% charge , there should be 7-9 hours left, not 4-5 which I consistently got.I don't expect it to be exact, just not misleading. I have 2 Samsung cell phones and 1 flat panel Tv all of which are great..as an engineer by training, charging and reporting time left should be a minor issue..very disappointing for a Samsung product.The prior Asus Chromebook didn't have this problem.3/22 update The time left reporting battery reporting feature seems to have improved somewhat i.e. after the machine ""warms"" up the time left will improve at lets say 97% charge from 5 plus hours to over 7 hours(but just over). I haven't seen 8 hours left at 100 % charge under any conditions. Again, I don't expect the measurement to be exact, but they must be sensing battery temperature as it warms up and using software to predict time left on charge...maybe the battery has to ""cure""? Response time is still a bit slower than the old Asus it replaced, but again the Samsung seems to be of sturdier construction.",0
"My son has a nice decent gaming rig, He always wants to play games with me, but I dont use a PC so we cant play anything together. I got this and not only is it fast, it runs games better than his full sized pc can. screen is nice, graphics crips and gets really good framerates in the games we play. I personally do not try to ultra out anything graphics wise and always opt for best quality to performance ratio. This has worked amazingly so far. Battery life is decent for a laptop.Turbo mode makes the fans go pretty loud. During heavy use fans can also get pretty loud. Not much you can do, but what do expect from a powerhouse that is packaged in a small case.RTX3060 graphics make games look amazing. really love this thing. Love the Keyboard and this thing is a beast.Great system, and perfect for being able to game anywhere.",0
I use this puppy for some cpu intensive music production and it handles it like a champ. Just make sure it's plugged in when putting it through its steps. It drains pretty fast but that's to be expected.,0
This laptop is great for its size and lightweight but the capability is just utterly terrible. Came with no instruction book had to go through loopholes to get it out of windows 10 s onto windows 10. Tried to reset the laptop back to factory settings so many times and it just stops at 35% and gives me a screen telling me that there has been a problem with the reset. WOuld not purchase again.,0
"as a former ipad user, i am finding it a difficult adjustment to use the google system. some of the apps, for example facebook, do not operate as smoothly as they did on my apple device. i like the chrome book, it is an affordable and useful device for managing basic things like email and general internet use.",0
Really enjoying it,0
"Completely annoyed the sellers description did not mention this laptop comes loaded with version Windows 10 in S Mode. This nonsense version of Windows censors/restricts your downloads to ONLY those apps ""approved"" by the almighty Microsoft store. It specifically EXCLUDES the ability to download or install Google Chrome as your browser. You better be on-board with using Edge as your browser if you buy this. Solution? You must download MS Windows 10 PRO for $104 for the privilege of then being able to remove the restrictions on what you can or cannot install on your own PC. What nonsense. Had I known that in advance of ordering this, I would NOT have ordered this laptop as configured.",0
"Très bon portable, léger, rapide, tout fonctionne parfaitement. Livraison rapide et tout était bien emballé.",0
"Slow, unreliable, not good for video conferences.",0
"Sleek, professional, and beautiful design.",0
"not meant to be used as a gaming lap top. it runs off chrome os so that means it is not set up at all like windows. all apps and tabs are on the bottom screen panel, there is no additional number lock keypad in the bottom right corner like you're Originally used to so no high expectations for a singular use lap top. Meant for single tasks such as school with bare minimum task preformance. Though i am impressed with the preformance of such a compact notebook.",0
I bought the computer less than a year ago. It was declared as 'new' and now when I wanted to use my warranty I discovered it is expired because it was opened more than 3 years ago so the computer couldn't be new.my earphones plugin does not work and I don't have a warranty.It's very annoying and frustrating.,0
"Love chrome, seems constructed well. Awesome key pad, great feel. Sharp screen.",0
"Bought this laptop two days ago. Good features for the price.It has a sleek design, good sound, nice screen, Nvidia GTX 1050 (haven't tested it yet but it can run most games smoothly), HDD+SDD.However, with some usage, i noticed that the battery backup is not great as compared to other ultrabooks. This could be due to the fact that it is designed for mid range gaming. So, with heavy use, the battery will drain faster.Overall, I like this laptop and it provides good features than other laptops in this price range.",0
Excellent value.,0
My aunt loved it. Of course you can't really do anything without internet,0
"Was lucky to get this on Thanksgiving for a great price, not a serious gamer, but tech specs are phenomenal at the price point I got it for",0
TouchPad left click failed and keeps getting stuck and won't spring back up.,0
"It is very good. My only issue is that it is not intuitive (at least to me) to select and drag and drop text or links. But overall, I am very satisfied with the speed and ease of use of this laptop.",0
I ordered this lab top for my son and loves it. I'm glad because I loved the price. It has all the features the other name brands and more and its much cheaper.,0
"This computer is a good computer for the price. I have had it for a short time and hope to keep it for the next 2 years. I will see how it goes throughout the next year. The keys type well, the keyboard is a little awkward. Apart from that, all works great!",0
I was kinda shocked to see that housed the power supply and then a much more sleek box that had the laptop inside.,0
Rapidez y calidad,0
battery life is too short. discharges within 2 hrs,0
Great except the battery life is barely better than my old chromebook and significantly shorter than my dell inspiron and lenovo legion. The speakers are also kind've weak. But otherwise a great laptop for the price.,0
Poor fan with excessive random loud noise and the headphone jack isn't working. Just completely the worst experience of buying it. I don't recommend this to be bought. Especially from this seller. They have defected models.,0
the fans started really kicking up.,0
"Después de un a?o de uso puedo decir que es un buen producto, tiene un slot para otra ram, tiene un puerto el espacio y los tornillos para un disco duro 3,5""Aun funcionando como el primer dia.",0
"I was initially pleased with this purchase, however, after 9 months the hard drive died. It was under warranty and I had to go through hoops to send it away and get it fixed. Came back totally wiped, which I expected, but not that I would need to re purchase Microsoft office suite. Even when logging in with my Microsoft ID. Doing myself a favor, switching to apple.",0
"Works great, just doesn't like to have several windows open at a time",0
AS ADVERTISED!,0
I love it easy to use abd love how you can make it like a tablet,0
Speakers are not loud enough,0
"Beautiful screen and keyboard, thin and light.",0
"Didn't get what I paid for, 1TB, not the 2TB as advertised, such a pain to return,just kept it.The laptops not bad, thought it would be faster..",0
The visual display is awesome and very clear and bright.,0
It will NOT boot up. I bought insurance from Amazon.. For crying out loud. I think it is hopeless.,0
Please don’t waste your money I’ve owned this laptop for a about a year and it’s been nothing but problems Lenovo has already sent someone to my house to fix this thing twice now it’s broken for a third time and they will no longer honor my warranty,0
"in the middle of the display, a big rectangular patch of grayish color.",0
i have used it for gaming and adobe/affinity design with some video editing and it has been great Very fast and eats anything i throw at it,0
I got it for internet browsing and internet browsing alone. Battery life is great. Screen size is great. Price is great.Would recommend 100%.,0
I like how light and well built the laptop is,0
"It’s a decent laptop, was on sale so the price was better.",0
"So far this computer has been good. I''ve played Doom Eternal and I am now playing Cyberpunk 2077 on it. The games look great and run well. It's a decently solid machine. I added 2 additional hard drives to it. I did not like how the casing comes apart to add the hard drives. It felt like very delicate procedure designed to break the casing. I got it done without breaking anything, but definitely watch videos on how to do it before you try. The bios is odd, I want to figure out how to set one of the added hard drives as bootable, but the bios doesn't seem to want me to do that...says something about window boot manager?. I would prefer the old c, d, f, g or whatever it used to be. Sometimes a guy just wants to set the boot order to 1st a non-bootable drive, then another non-bootable drive and then the bootable drive....actually I wanted to figure out if I could load win 10 on another drive and boot to it so I could run some older firewire audio hardware that doesnt support win 11. Guess that I may be too old or not motivated enough to figure it out. Speakers are tinney but ok. Good ports. Keyboard is ok. Sometimes computer is a bit wonky, locks up on weird stuff or won't boot a game, but I just restart it and everything is fine. The price was good. I am not sure why amazon thinks this thing has a touch screen. It doesn't. I just touched it and it didn't do anything.",0
"I love this Chromebook. The price was great, the screen is nice and large, battery life lasts a long time and it isn't heavy. This works great for school and fits all of my needs. I haven't come across a situation where I needed a PC or different system. I'm very pleased with getting a 2018 model for under $200, especially with the screen size. The speakers are nicer than the last Chromebook model I had as well. I'm very happy with this purchase.",0
"I bought this less than 6 months ago, already have had multiple issues with BSOD. Before I had that issue, the battery wasn’t great, the screen was ok but just started showing signs of malfunction out of the blue, and the graphics card couldn’t comfortably run total war: Troy. Right now I can’t even do my school assignments before the computer crashes. Definitely glad I bought the warranty.",0
"The lap top will not turn on, this has happened 35 days after purchase. Up to today it was working. Not now ! Looks like I am out $400+ dollars.and I am dam mad.. this should not happen on a supposedly new computer. Amazon should do something about it but apparently they won’T",0
"I’m not going to talk about specs because they all clearly listed on the page but more about an experience I have had in a past week with this laptop.First of all I never had a laptop with touchscreen so I’m getting used to it a little bit considering I’m a mouse kind of person but it sure is handy when you don’t have one or when we will be flying.Sizing is perfect for us because this is our household laptop and take with us traveling, it’s light, fits perfectly in my purse or hubbys backpack, sizing is super universal.Everything I streamed so far have fabulous performance, very enjoyable clear picture and sound just right, again very useful in a car or plane for our son.I’m technically behind I think so I couldn’t figure out how to plug in the mouse but there is adapter that comes with it from USB to C that you can utilize but we also have Bluetooth mouse that works perfectly with it.Speed is fantastic, no lagging, just smooth and fast, I mean I can’t ask for better experience. I’m utilizing it with my office products for some work stuff and home, really we using it for multifunctional purposes because it just can handle it on, small but mighty!It’s quite, I use it with no issues when my baby snoozing next to me but it tends to get a bit hot when using it proactively with multiple things running, I might look into cooking pad for it at some point but I really try not to use it too much in bed.We enjoy it, we really do, very user friendly just perfect for our family!",0
"This is a great laptop, but the description lies about a couple of details. The USB C port is NOT a 3.2 (meaning it doesn't support USB C charging-- this was sort of important to me so that I can use my phone charger for my laptop too). Additionally, the wifi card does NOT support Wifi6 (802.11AX).",0
"Hello. I waited to write this review hoping it would fix the laptop freezing problem but it took me too long and I missed the return time. I was left with a lousy machine that barely works well playing music and videos; and I say hardly because even with this it crashes. DELL service told me to update everything, factory restore and nothing helped. The laptop freezes, the only key that remains working is the on and off key, you have to hold it to force it to turn off and on again. Not even ctrl+alt+del works. I bought it and brought it to Colombia, I did not take into account the international guarantee and now they tell me that I have to do it in the US or buy the international guarantee but that first I have to fix the fault (which is from the factory) and then buy the guarantee. TERRIBLE SERVICE. For future purchases, I will return to Lenovo, with this brand I have always done well.",0
Pretty good bang for the buck. Perfect for remote learning with the bonus of decent gaming capability. 9 year old loves it.,0
"It died after two months of use and if you read the return policy, they are expecting it to be dead on arrival and you have 30 days to return. Obviously it lived over the 30 days and died soon after. Nobody can figure out why it fried and went dead. Useless!",0
"HELP, HELP HELP necesito conversar con alguien por favor, con respecto a una devolicion!!!",0
"I think it's over priced, there's certain games I cannot play but I can play on my smartphone, I would think a laptop should work better than a smartphone..",0
"Just got this two days ago. So far my only issue is the battery, which I used off the charger last night for an hour or two and now that I’ve plugged it back in it’s only charged to 95% and stopped. It won’t charge any further.",0
"Es muy buena opción por el tipo de procesador, los materiales no son premium pero cumplen, la laptop en color azul resulta un poco más oscuro en la vida real, pero se sigue viendo muy bonita. Me gustó mucho el producto. Llevo 2 semanas utilizando la y todo funciona correctamente. Yo la compré en $7,900.°° pero he visto bajar su precio a menos de $ 7,600.°°. Recomiendo esperar un precio así para adquirirla y valdrá aún más la pena.",0
I have had a few random black screens on the laptop it self.,0
"Got it for 1099 on sale. Great value at that price. Downloaded ThrottleStop and decreased voltage of cpu. Temps stay within high 50's, lower 60's.GPU is different story. I've found normal settings have given best overall temp to performance experiance. With a cooler, gaming temps - cpu 60, gpu 70. Not bad.",0
Have it for about two months and its amazing,0
"The cámara it’s really good , so I just had my first problem with it I was doing homework and the screen started glitching so let’s see what happen",0
I returned this unit because came with a dead pixel on the screen but I order another one because I really like this laptop I think that for the price you can’t find better deal-configuration i7 11800h+Rtx 3060.I play any game 1080p max settings and I always get 60+ frames is just a very good all around gaming laptop for the price.,0
Working good,0
The chromebook is just what I want. It's great!!,0
"It's what I expected, great screen and fast enough! Sound could be somewhat better, but it is a laptop! Will add a hard drive and memory latter. Would buy again!",0
Great quality. Exceeded my expectations.,0
So far so good. A nice product.,0
"This laptop is very sleek and elegant looking, as opposed to a lot of other gaming laptops which are too flashy to be used for work. I appreciate that a lot.The power adapter on this thing is a HUGE 200-watt brick of a thing. It is NOT type C, but personally I don't really care that much.The battery charges quickly and maintains a charge for days. Very happy with that.It boots up in no time. Super fast response time when playing GOW on it. No lag whatsoever at any point.Really the only thing that I wasn't totally impressed with is the display. Next to my old HP computer, it's dimmer. I was surprised that it's only 250 NITS. I have a couple fairly inexpensive portable monitors and even they are 300 and 350 NITS. I'm one of those people that keeps my phone and computers at full brightness all the time. I really like a super bright display, so this was pretty disappointing to me. It makes the graphics look a but dull and not as crisp and vivid as they could be.Aside from that, this thing has checked off every box. It's replacing another HP laptop that is nearly 10 years old. I've had good luck with HP, so decided to stick with it.",0
The MacBookAir does not have a touch screen and I don't use it for gaming. It is a great notebook just as it is.,0
"Sitting at a table in Busse Woods near Chicago, sipping a joe, watching people walk by, I typed a thing or two I'd forget in a week.""Do you want to play a game?"" she asked. ""I'm Nancy,"" she said.Chess, I thought. Did she bring a set? No game. She brought nothing but a smile. I poured her a cup from my flask and she sat.""A game. On that,"" she said, pointing to my Lenovo Legion Y7000 Gaming Laptop.I told I'm not a gamer.""But..."" she looked.""I love the speed. It comes with an Intel Core i7-8750H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 Discrete Graphics, 16 GB DDR4 RAM, 1 TB HDD + 128GB PCIe SSD and more,"" I said.""What's all that?""""I don't know. It is fast. That's what I know.""""The fastest?"" she asked.""Probably not, but fast enough. It never crashes. The web, video, music apps, word processing. All at once. No problems.""""You do all that at once?""""No, but I tried it. Every app I'd use, I ran all together, just to see,"" I explained.The afternoon never got around to gaming, but my laptop never lost power. The battery surprised me.I don't carry it often. When I do, it is heavy. This is over five pounds, but I don't care.May your Lenovo Legion Y7000 Gaming Laptop please you, and attract gamers walking by who don't want to game. It will get the job done, and you'll have time to share your coffee with whomever you like.--Brockeim",0
"Like the title says, it can play star citizen. I got the one with gtx 1650, i5-9300H, and 8gb ram. I have a ram upgrade arriving tomorrow but I got the laptop today, installed and booted it up and in a city was getting steady 30fps, with some minor frame rate drops here and there but it is absolutely playable. I feel if it can handle Star citizen it can handle just about any game you throw at it.",0
"Really like this laptop. Small, light and looks great. Hardest part of setting up the computer was turning it on. Found my network and found my wireless printer with no issues. About two hours to bring it to a full charge and I was off and running to the great network in the sky.Early days yet but very happy after day 1.",0
Heavier than I thought it would be. Fit and finish is very good. I like it!,0
"I only purchased this chromebook for backup, to use when I travel. I don't like the fact that you cannot download apps, and the touch screen. However I also purchased a mouse to use.",0
I love the Laptop. It looks cool and cool red keyboard lights. Screen is super clear. Runs great for everything I use it for since I bought it. So far there isn't anything I don't like about it.,0
"Gaming laptops have come a long way, this thing pushes most titles at a reasonable FPS...so long as you don't try pushing it to an external 4k monitor. Don't expect it to run cool, or not to drain the battery like mad though..I also use it for some GIS/Remote Sensing work on the side, and its...well it works... not particularly well for anything RAM intensive. If I use this machine for that it means something has gone spectacularly wrong with my employer's infrastructure so that aspect isn't a huge concern.",0
"Got this for my college Freshman daughter, she absolutely loves it!! So light to carry around campus, fast connections, and the battery lasts all (class) day. Not to mention all the non class things she does( Facebook, reading, streaming, ETC)",0
Great product for the price!,0
"This laptop was for my daughter she loves it , it is fast and perfect for her needs",0
the price for this laptop is good. But the quality is not so good for gaming.,0
"I own the UX330 (7th gen), and I love the battery life. I dual boot Ubuntu and run that as my main OS, and I routinely get 12 hours on it. I would highly recommend it for anyone that doesn't need a dedicated graphics card (photo/video editing, gaming) as the battery life is phenomenal.I try to charge it at around 40% and not past 80% to preserve battery life, so I only get about 5-6 hours SOT, but I'm only using 40% of the battery at a time. It charges quickly, 30 minutes or less to get that 40%, and I almost never turn it off, I just let it sleep. I can let it sleep for a couple days and if it drops 1% in that time I'm surprised.The screen angle is a bit annoying, I wish it would go back a bit further (15 degrees more would be great), but its light and it feels durable (not as nice as a macbook, but its half the price).I have had issues sometimes with the trackpad not responding properly, but I believe thats due to Ubuntu. It works wonderfully in Windows, I never have any issues typing in Windows and my hand usually rests on the trackpad, which caused problems with my previous laptop.The USB C is amazing for me, as my phone is USB C, it really makes life easy. Not as big of a plus if you don't have other usb c devices. The mini HDMI is annoying, I still haven't purchased any miniHDMI to HDMI cables.The speakers are in a terrible spot, underneath the laptop, and they're pretty underpowered. Again, in my mind, that would fall under a media machine, which this is not, so its not a deal breaker for me.My girlfriend purchased the 8th gen. It has a slightly more powerful processer, but less battery life. It still lasts a very long time, and she has no complaints.All in all, I love my laptop. Its unbelievably light, and the battery is awesome, and its more than quick enough for anything I use it for, as I don't do anything graphically intensive.",0
I purchased this computer for my 89 year old Mother who was having trouble operating a Windows 7 based lap top. The new Chromebook has exceeded all expectations and my Mother loves it.Her time to have her email open went from 2 minutes / 45 seconds to 23 seconds on thew Chromebook..Wonderful!,0
Pretty dang slow,0
I bought one for my son and it's so good for gaming! A real powerhouse and fun equipped with red LED keyboard backlite.,0
"Es un excelente equipo, cumplió totalmente las expectativas para el uso que se buscaba (modelado 3d, renderizado y animación), en cuanto a la entrega llegó incluso antes de lo esperado.Producto 100% recomendado.",0
"Great value! If you are embedded in the Google environment, it will do everything you need. You have to remember, it is basically just a web-browsing machine, but a fast one! Easy to set up, easy to tweak! Great for kids or adults! If someone is not a computer expert, they will handle this machine just fine. The screen is big, bright, and quality construction. Overall, great value for the money.",0
"A few months after receiving, the unit would start to shutdown on its own, then it would not turn on. It would turn on sometimes, then turn off on its own. This would happen when it was running on the battery or connected to the outlet. Two months shy of a year, it stopped turning on and just completely died. I mildly used the laptop throughout the time I had it, never used it on a daily basis and didn't use it for gaming or high demand applications. Very disappointed as it was almost $500. Never buying an HP laptop again.",0
"Nice display device for internet. Very limited on board storage. Just an expensive filler for backpack without internet. No windows based, can't transfer photos without more software.",0
"Garbage! HP must stand for horrible product! This junk is slow, heavy and the screen started going out after 6 months... If you pick it up while open the screen goes into pixels and starts flashing before going black. If you restart it takes a solid 20 minutes before you can use it again. I will never buy another hp product in my life. Get it together and stop selling worthless garbage!",0
"I've had Acer laptops before it's a very good laptop, for home and family use.",0
"I bought this computer to answer my emails and some research. It's not my dell with better keys, but it will do for the price. I had a local computer tech look at this computer, and he too agreed it was a good little computer for the price.",0
no problem,0
"Frequently ""hover-clicks"" when just passing over links even quickly.",0
VERY BAD EXPERIENCE. THE LAPTOP SENT NOT TESTED WAS FOR YOU. LAPTOP DOES NOT TURN ON ONLY THE POWER AND CAPS LOCK LIGHTS BLINK. NOBODY GIVES ME SUPPORT NOW I AM ALREADY IN MY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN ECUADOR AND NOW I HAVE TO RUN WITH EXPENSES TO SEND THE EQUIPMENT BACK. VERY BAD.,0
Nothing to dislike. Great product so far.,0
"This lap top is a replacement for an older alien ware desktop- and it is fantastic. On a game like DRG or DOOM, frame rates run about 170 fps, it has a cooling boost, so it does not have the heat issues that many are reporting with gaming laptops. I added a cooling pad just in case, but it runs fine without it. Colors are beautiful and even the web cam is tolerable. I think the sound is quite adequate, with headphones I am shocked how much more of the sound score I can hear. This unit is a fantastic value and highly recommended!",0
"This machine is a beast! As one who has a limited budget and looks to get a laptop that will last for a handful of years, this was the perfect fit. The price was great at the time of the purchase, and it comes with a FULL RTX 2070 (non-max Q)! This laptop benches a little higher than a desktop RTX 2060, and in some functions on par with a desktop RTX 2060 super. This means that in a few years I won't find myself wishing I had more power for gaming and video editing. While in the latter I would have loved to see this unit with a 4800H Ryzen 7, the 10th gen i7 is no slouch and is a strong upgrade from my old dated 7700HQ i7 where I was beginning to have issues when editing videos for YouTube.The laptop appearance is very nice as well with per key RGB, thin bezels, a fast 144 hz IPS like screen with around a 3 ms response time which means crystal clear and very responsive FPS. It was so crazy good that I had to learn to adjust to the response times being used to an older 60 HZ screen on my old laptop.So, the bottom line is that I strongly recommend this laptop. It is plenty powerful to run all triple A titles at max settings and have good to great frame rates.",0
"Nice product, no CD-ROM is sometimes an issue",0
"This is a great deal, The product came as promised and on time. This laptop is worth getting! i7, 16gig of RAM and SSD makes this laptop super fast to boot and respond.",0
"Cumple todo lo que promete. La bateria no dura tanto como dicen pero es porque es una bestia y quizas porque tenga algun problema en el software. Corre cyberpunk sin problemas, aunque eso si esos ventiladores que tiene son muy ruidosos, pero cumplen su funcion de mantener el cpu a buena temperatura. Es pesada y el cargador es un ladrillo de un kilo. La pantalla es de excelente calidad y muestra los colores con gran fidelidad. Tengo un mes de uso apenas con ella y hasta el momento muy satisfecho con la compra.",0
mine arrived quickly and in fine shape,0
internet banking,0
Nice product,0
"This is a great laptop to have around the house. It was cheap and is easy to use. It's great for browsing the web, checking emails, online shopping, and watching casual Youtube videos. Great price and simple to use.",0
Completely disappointed in both the product and the customer service available from Amazon and Samsung.,0
So far it's been doing great. I like the thin style and it looks like MacBook but with a cheaper price.,0
"Pros- Good configuration i7 with large FHD screen- USB C with charging and external display and this price point is good- 512 gb SDD and 16GB RAM is a plus- works fast, no issues so far- 1 year warranty gives me peace of mindAreas of improvement- outside look and feel is like budget laptops not aluminum- click pad is just ok- webcam is basic",0
"Despite being powerful, lightweight and crapware free, the chassis is not as strong as it appears to be. The durable aluminium body is held down onto fragile plastic plates that don't seem to be engineered to bear the stress of daily use.I noticed the backplate lifting in one corner a few days ago- I have owned this laptop since mid October. I've contacted customer support and hope to get a resolution to this, but honestly I'm pretty disappointed given the price point and the aluminium chassis being one of the more attractive selling points to me.If you are going to use this as a professional work horse keep this in mind.",0
It's a good gaming machine. The specs of this laptop are very good but the only issue is the fans..1- it's very loud and sometimes cant use microphone to talk to someone while using this laptop2- it gets hot very quickly reaching above 70 °C most of the time.,0
Surprisingly fast 2 in 1 tablet for the price,0
"I love everything about my Cromebook, I'm very pleased.",0
The back lit keyboard is very convenient - and it is beautiful!,0
Used by my daughter for her school work,0
"This Chromebook broke within 2 months of receiving it. I made a claim and this proved to be difficult becasue there was no serial number on the bottom of the device!! The barcode was there, but no number....",0
"Awful!!! It is painfully slow. Screen is fine, battery life is fine but it takes forever to load web pages. Even worse if you have multiple tabs open at once. Stay away, find another product.",0
"It worked okay for the first week or so, although the keys backlight didn't work.Then it went completely dead. It was no more. Stone dead. Joined the bleedin' choir invisible. It was an ex-parrot.",0
"Seems like a great laptop so far. I want to note that is only comes with 1 SO-DIMM slot, the other is soldered. I am purchasing a 32 gb stick to try and at least upgrade it to 40 gb. Although overall first impressions are great. I had no idea that ASUS had a 1 year complimentary accidental damage protection.",0
"Already own this chrome book and when my mother asked for a computer for cheistmas for web surfing, I had no second thought about buying her the same one. Perfect if you just need internet functionalities and portability",0
"Recd on time, works good",0
Works great for my middle school child . not for an office or work place,0
"After only 7 months using this laptop, the charger cord failed. I have been trying to replace the cord to actually see if that's why the laptop won't respond to charging and have had absolutely no assistance from Amazon, or ASUS. My advice, DON'T BUY ASUS PRODUCTS. Don't buy any computers, etc. from Amazon. Go to your local dealers where you can walk in and deal with a human being. It may cost a few bucks more, but in the end, you will be getting your money's worth. I now have a $380 laptop that is useless to me. I'm going to continue to visit different computer repair shops in an attempt to find out if in fact, it is the charger cord, but take my advice and DO NOT BUY COMPUTERS FROM AMAZON!UPDATE: I did find a cord and have been using the laptop, but now I have a new problem! I can't access the internet! It's probably something I'm not doing, but I'm 81 and modern technology is difficult for us old people. So if you don't have someone living with you that can help you with stuff, DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP NO MATTER HOW INEXPENSIVE (CHEAP) IT IS!",0
For the price and the High end components this MSI came with I thought it was too good to be true. Well it wasn't. So far I've tested its maximum graphics capabilities and haven't succeeded to reach it's limits. I needed something beefy in specs that will handle video editing and this combo with the RTX 2070 that switches between Gaming and Creative Studio mode is just what I needed! So far it's perfect and I'm loving the RGB Keyboard!,0
I love it and it's a great way for someone that doesn't have a laptop. Its durable and a lot more useful with the touchscreen.,0

"The laptop is great. I really like it. I gave it a 4 star because of the right side portion of keyword where the numbers are located. They are a bit smaller then the actual letter and are a bit cramped in so sometimes I press the wrong numbers. Its fast, boots up really quick. I would say when I hit the power button, the login screen appears within 5 seconds at most. The powering off is quick as well. Its really quiet, I don't even notice when fans are on and my office is pretty quiet during the day. Only when I'm using a large software program do I hear the fans and not much at all...The laptop does have a quality look and feel with its metal finish. The keyboard is lit and is really helpful. Its slim and light weight. The speakers also sound good, has some bass it to as well...",0
"I got it to play games. Unfortunately, I can't play games. Skip this and save yourself heart break and frustration. You can do far better. Just because the price "" seems reasonable "" is not a good excuse to get it. Save up to get better. It just won't stop crashing no matter what I do.Amazon. Stop selling these. They are incredibly bad and you shouldn't let others experience the frustration I went through, just to fail and give up. Remove this laptop immediately from your warehouses. Recycle them, preferably.",0
"I use this Ultrabook as my main PC both at home and on the road. At home I connect it to an external 32"" monitor via the HDMI connecter and work from there (popping open the lid when I turn it on to access the excellent fingerprint reader, then closing it again afterwards). The boot up time on this (after cleaning off all the crapware of course) is incredible. 7-8 seconds from power on to asking for fingerprint. I bought this knowing it was not a gaming PC, but it can run things like World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and some steam games fine, but things like Overwatch are about the max it can handle (and then only at low settings). Overall, one of the best laptops I have ever owned.",0
Bought this HP laptop as NEW not a refurbished or used one. Was very excited to use it considering it has 4.5 stars. Very disappointed. I have an 6 year old laptop that will run faster than this thing. It can’t even find any Wi-Fi networks and to finally get connected to one it takes a very long time to do so. The discovery mode for searching for any devices is absolutely terrible. This thing sucks,0

"This is an update to the original feedback.It was all good until it started to fall apart. Firs the keyboard started to play, and I had to get a replacement (just outside the first year of warranty).Then the hinge system gradually started falling apart. I was going to blame my son for playing rough on it.But when I opened it up, the plastics were crumbling, almost like old plastics. Then the frame cover around the display started coming off, again it looked like the glues and the click-in plastics were losing their grip.I solved all these by a lot of super-glue and pouring epoxy in the hinge compartment. It is holding up, but it looks darn ugly.On the plus side, it is quite easy to open up, and replace components and fix stuff, but there is a limit to how far you can go.I am waiting for it to completely fall apart.Would I buy this again. No way, unless I want to throw away one laptop a year, or practice laptop fixing!===================I bought this for my son in January. The charge lasts the entire day at school, and I know that it is not all used for educational purposes.The display is very matt and gives the impression of not being sharp, but in fact it is quite ok and it proves very useful in bright environments, and you get no reflection.The keyboard is quite good and feels nice.It doesn't produce noise (except when under a lot of pressure mainly during updates and heavy graphics usage).The ports are great and useful.The storage and memory are also at the sweep spot, and well balanced.So overall extremely happy, given that the price difference here in australia for a similar spec would be around the $500.",0

"The product has a very good price ($1499) considering the components it contains, it has a very good value for money. The material of the upper case is aluminum and that of the lower case is plastic, although this does not affect performance, the materials are of good quality. It is a compact laptop considering that it is a gamer laptop, in addition to the performance when playing the game is very good, all the games tested on the laptop ran at maximum and without fps drops. Highly recommended if you want to invest in a laptop with good durability, especially for gaming. The battery does not have much durability, however, being a gaming laptop, the ideal is that it is always connected to the battery for maximum performance.",0

Returned because not working properly after repair. They were kind enough to return for refund.,0
For the money it is a really great machine. However if you are running mmorpgs you are almost definitely going to want to get a cooling pad otherwise the fans do get kinda loud. Its cool that you can adjust the fan speed when needed too. Also idk how this will affect anyone else and it may just be a me thing but i have a magnetic closure on a wristwatch that causes the screen to throw hissy fits when worn on my left wrist and making contact with the lower left corner of the laptop (magnets and computers dont mix well lol).,0

"Build quality is great, though it is plastic-y it is solid. I like the somewhat old-school vibe to the shell design. Doesn't feel heavy to pick up, though the power brick lives up to its name. Keyboard, touchpad, screen and specs are all excellent for the price point. Vantage grants a lot of customization for performance and battery life. They also make it easy to extend the warranty. I highly recommend getting this laptop if you are constrained on budget. There are no corners cut, and also, happily, almost no bloatware!",0
"Though the construction and appearance were great - and I was excited by all of the options and overall performance specs, immediately on startup there were issues. I worked through all of the suggested support solutions (driver installs, updates, etc) it became clear with ASUS tech support that there was a hardware issue. The tech suggested I return.The fact that the laptop was brand new straight from the box and had fundamental issues makes me dubious of the quality control. At this point I could not recommend ASUS as a laptop manufacturer - though I have had great luck with their desktop motherboards. Very sad about this one.",0
Everything I wanted in a laptop.,0
"My experience seems on par with many others: a powerful, good-looking laptop, but with the loudest fans you've ever heard and the potential to run HOT, as is expected from some of the hardware in this machine. A headset will tune out the fan noise, and other reviewers have suggested some helpful tweaks for fine tuning performance if you're comfortable doing so. It has done everything I've asked of it and even runs some game settings on high that I wouldn't normally try. My screen did end up with a dead pixel within about a week of purchase - but since I only notice it on startup, it doesn't bother me enough to take off a star because overall this laptop fits the bill exactly for my needs.",0
It has a gorgeous touch screen,0
"I got the 12UGKV-464 version, which is the i7-12700H with the RTX 3070.Pros:Very fast, runs new games at Ultra with no problemStyling, i like it but that's subjectiveCompact for a laptop with this performanceBang for buck, if you grab it on sale, it's worth the amount of performance you can get for a laptop at this price point compared to its competitorsCons:Screen color is awful (I've spent hours in the app trying to correct it but it is just bad)Runs HOT, even with the fan on max, I've seen the CPU jump above 90c many times.Storage, it comes with a 512gb drive, which with windows leaves you with not much room. This version only has one extra m2 slot and no 2.5"" slot. Also, adding another drive requires you to open to laptop, breaking the seal and voiding your warranty.Battery life, I brought this to a meeting at work once instead of my smaller chromebook. Even on 'super battery mode', only running MS Word, the battery didn't survive the 1.5 hour meeting. It's technically a laptop but don't expect to be able to use it not plugged in for any amount of time.Overall, I'd give it a 4/5.The performance of this thing is great, I've tried many new games with it and it's performed very well.The cooling issues are very concerning, as this can seriously shorten the lifespan of the CPU (the GPU doesn't seem to have the same issues). The heat, lack of expandable storage, nonexistant battery life, and the screen coloration are holding this back from being a 5/5 for me. If you are going to use this primarily at home, somewhere it can be kept well ventilated, connected to an external monitor and occasionally bring it out, I'd suggest it.",0
Very easy to set up and use,0
Really slow and closed out the internet everyone I was using it...,0
"NOTE: This is the Canadian version of the N580VD. I am not sure why they are selling this instead of the US variant. However, that is what Asus told me. I haven’t noticed any difference between this and the US version, so I do not see any issue with buying this instead.Short Review: This device is a solid machine. It fits a powerful and capable amount of hardware, in a clean and slim design. The screen suffers from bad viewing angles and subpar colors, but is still good enough for most tasks. Overall, this device is quite the bargain when you consider the form factor, performance, and features you are getting for the price.Full Detail Review:- The CPU(i7-7700HQ) is great. It can do pretty much anything you want it to. I am not particularly heavy on computers, but I tested a little bit of After Effects on here and the device handled it very easily. Chrome is no issue when bundled with the 16GB of RAM on this machine. The i7-7700HQ is about as good as you are going to get in a laptop right now, so you really can't complain in terms of CPU performance.- The integrated GPU is solid. The GTX 1050 can handle just about any game you throw at it, given it isn’t a AAA title from this year. Overwatch runs at 60FPS on medium graphics. Dirt 3 runs at 110 FPS on ultra-graphics, and Civ 5/6 have no issues running on this device. If the GPU power is a concern for you, go check out some reviews on YouTube about the GTX 1050, that will be able to give you a full rundown on this GPU. Note: It also has Integrated Intel HD 630 Graphics, those are solid too, but irrelevant to the main graphics performance.- Cooling is not an issue under normal performance. It runs completely cool and quiet when performing simple tasks or just browsing Chrome. When gaming, the device really heats up and the fans get rather loud. It gets very hot, seeing temperatures push into 150 degrees Fahrenheit. I absolutely advise against gaming on a bed with this, this is a flat surface gaming machine, hands down. It isn’t something that would comfortably rest on your lap. This laptop is a tabletop gaming machine but if you are just writing a paper or browsing chrome, it’s comfortable in your laptop or wherever you can safely use it. However, my device did have an issue with one of the fans after just about a week of use. The left fan was working at Max load, while the right wouldn't spin up at all. This resulted in a machine that got hotter than I could touch. I attempted to contact Asus about my issues but their Support is a nightmare and reaching someone who can actually help you diagnose the problem, is a rare occurrence.- The SSD(250GB) is fantastic! Boot times are insane! Average boot time from being completely off is about 5-7 seconds. I loaded all my core programs to the SSD and left the 1TB HDD to be the data drive. So far it has been a perfect combination. Everything performs just great! Storage isn't an issue and with the SSD, the speed is amazing.- The main thing that brought me to this machine is that it isn't coated in ugly red RGB lighting and ""gamer"" aesthetics. The device is clean. It isn’t hard to compare this design to a MacBook(Minus the full aluminum uni-body, I will talk about this later). You can walk into your office with this thing and still look professional. It does a good job of packing a lot of power into a relatively small body.- According to Asus, the device has an all-aluminum body. I can confirm that the device is in fact Aluminum, but has an odd feel to it. It is almost like they painted the metal with plastic. The device does not feel like a MacBook or Zenbook. It feels sturdy and good, but it leaves you wanting that raw metal touch. It does have that chilled metal feel to it, so it is obviously metal. However, I do know that the bottom of this device is plastic, it doesn't get cool like the rest of the device, doesn't feel the same, and just looks like plastic. This was obviously either a cost saving or performance related cut that Asus took to keep this device in a more affordable category. Rest assured however, it doesn't really take away from the overall feel off the device. When interacting with the laptop you are always in contact with metal and it feels really nice.- The trackpad is in a good place for me. It is out of the way when typing and I don’t mistakenly hit it. This is subjective to how each person uses the device, but in my experience, I have no complaints with the placement of the trackpad. The trackpad also performs fine for me. It has some weird gestures that I am not sure how I keep activating, but as far as usability, it is good. The buttons are clicky and tactile, however, I have an issue sometime moving the cursor while trying to click. I am just not used to this kind of trackpad.-The keyboard is good. It has reasonable travel and I haven’t experienced any major flexing in the keyboard. The backlight works well and it has 3 brightness options. The numpad is weird and kind of feels out of place. I would prefer if they hadn’t added one on this model, because it just feels so squished and incomplete. However if a trackpad is desired, this model features one, albeit a small one.- The sound on this laptop is good. It has two speakers on the bottom of the device. They can get muffled a little if you use this on your lap, but on a flat surface, they really perform well. They get much louder than anything I have ever owned and hit the high tones well. Bass is decent, it gets deeper than most laptops in this form factor but I can’t expect a lot from something this size either. Some people have complained about speakers distrorting after going over a certain volume. I haven't really experienced this and it may be because I use the included Software utility to choose sound modes. This tool is what Asus claims, will make the device loud without distortion. So perhaps not using this tool could be the issue, but I cannot confirm this.- The screen is the what made this device lose a star from me. It’s a FHD(1920x1080) TN panel. The viewing angles are quite awful and colors look slightly washed out when looking horizontally or vertically at an angle. The screen is a matte material, so reflections aren’t a problem. Seeing as how I paid $1000 for this laptop, I expect a premium display and an IPS display would help a lot. (This laptop is still one of the best for the buck on Amazon though) I also have two small areas on my screen with pixels that are not working right. It’s a small issue that causes a small area to look slightly brighter and kind of washed out. I am going to see if Asus will replace/repair the device, because it can get annoying.- Battery life is not the best, but is about what you would expect on a device with a high-performance CPU and GPU. I get about 4-5 hours of battery life when doing basic and simple tasks. However, I only get about 1-2 hours when playing high intensity games. It is important to note that it charges very fast. I have not gotten a complete measurement, but it charges faster than other laptops I have owned.- The network card on this laptop is great. It has good connectivity and achieves the max speeds of my network. I have no complaints about the network card.*Shipping Issue* This device arrived in a box that was much bigger than it should have been. The box was easily twice the size that it needed to be and there was no protection inside the box. There was literally a laptop box inside a much bigger shipping box (see picture), nothing to pad it or protect it. I hope Amazon fixes this issue because it isn’t at all safe to ship this device like that. My screen has a small issue that might have been cause by this shipping issue. NOTE: I contacted Amazon about my complaints with the packaging and they offered me a generous compensation or replacement, whichever I chose. The shipping issue will hopefully be resolved soon.Disclaimer: I returned this product. I was having an issue with one of the fans not working. I attempted to contact Asus. To say the least, their support is garbage! I contacted them via chat, phone, and twitter. Everytime I was met with long delays or disconnects. I couldn't speak to someone who could help me, often times even getting someone who seemed like they didn't even know Asus made laptops. Eventually Asus's Twitter got back to me, but they insisted that I just send it in. They offered no diagnostic. I needed this machine and I at least needed to know what was wrong and how long it would take, they offered no answers and said that was all they could do. With that in mind I started a refund with Amazon. This laptop is really good if it fits your needs and isn't broken. However once you do have an issue with the hardware, you enter into a support Hell. I really hope Asus fixes their support. For now I am going to check out the XPS 15.",0

"Great gaming laptop for the price. I mainly play Warzone, and the graphics are so crisp my buddy is jealous. There are only a couple downsides in my opinion. Battery dies after one game match, but I don't mind keeping it plugged in when I play. Hard drive space is definitely lacking, but I'm just going to get a an external hard drive to alleviate that. Overall the issues that I think it has are easily maneuvered around and it's worth the price.",0

Fantastic gaming laptop! This is a huge improvement over the Acer Nitro laptop in every way. The 144 hz screen is incredible and it’s hard to go back to standard 60 hz displays after using it. You can push your mobile gaming to the limit but be aware the battery life is not great. The fans can also get extremely loud when playing graphic intensive games. This is a great middle point gaming laptop for anyone looking to game on the go!,0
I was looking for something powerful but small and thin. This Ultrabook fulfills those characteristics.,0
"Let me start by saying almost everything about this laptop is great. The design is sleek and pleasing, it doesn't scream ""I'm a gamer"", it is lightweight, the parts all feel like good quality parts, and the performance is unbelievable. Coming from an outdated GTX 960M laptop, using this felt like a dream come true.Unfortunately, right from the minute I booted the PC up, I was met with a very obnoxious static/electronic/beeping noise coming from within the case. I thought it might go away, but after some research, I found that I was experiencing coil whine, which, from what I understand, is basically vibrations of small components of the motherboard, and results from cheap outsourced parts. The coil whine produced by the laptop is far too audible for me, and is definitely a dealbreaker. For a less expensive PC, maybe, but when I'm paying 2k+ for a brand new, top of the line gaming rig, I won't tolerate these kinds of things. I'll definitely be returning it.Additionally, from the few other reviews I've read on Amazon regarding the new RTX (2060, 2070, 2080) series of this laptop, others are experiencing the same issue; so its probably a widespread issue with this model. For that reason, I would strongly advise against buying this laptop or any of the Strix Scar II RTX series. Search ""coil whine"" on YouTube if you want to hear what its like trying to operate this machine. There are far too many solid value RTX machines on the market right now to tolerate coil whine.All in all, I am very disappointed, as aside from the coil whine, this laptop is near perfect for my needs. Oh well, time to give MSI a try ;)",0
I really like it. It seems to be built nicely the only down side is I had to update the drivers since I wanted to use it as a light gaming computer. Other than that I haven't had a problem.,0

Then this morning1/5/2021 it went biserk flickering, the mouse and the touch pad stopped working, the sound turned off and will not come back on, it will not allow me to log on to SOPtv, Netflix or Amazon Prime movies....and typing this is taking forever as it types one letter at a time...with several seconds between letters.

"I'm giving this a 5 star because the laptop is perfect for what it is and the seller was great, however I watched multiple YouTube videos glorifying the M1 chip as being fast enough that 8GB could handle a ton of open applications. I need a bunch of tabs open for my work, use Canva constantly, and occasionally need to open Photoshop too so I needed to return this and buy 16GB. But that's my fault and the YouTube reviews faults, not the laptop. Battery life is amaaaazing though!",0

"I ordered the XPS 9500 UHD+ model in mid January 2021 and still received a unit that had the loose/rattle-plagued touchpad issue. I returned it and ordered another thinking this to be a fluke, as the issue was supposed to be resolved. The issue touchpad issue was worse on the second model.Word to the wise: while the diving board touchpad mechanism is not going to be as rigid as Apple's Force Touch pad, plenty of other laptops have stable, rattle-free and firm touchpads ranging from Razer to HP to Lenovo. Dell's got to go back to the drawing board on the large touchpad built into the 9500. It's going to be something of a lottery with the possibility of multiple exchanges to find one that's suitable.",0

"Overall purchasing experience was good, delivered in the expected time frame and perfect condition. Although amazon packaging seemed careless since it was not cushioned, I mean the laptop box was sent inside an amazon box with no shock proof protection as I have gotten with other not so fragile items, however the laptop box was in perfect condition, so the package management was good through the deliver.The laptop itself is a good trade off between power and price, there is enough CPU power to work on the go and just enough GPU for occasional gaming.Build feels great and robust despite being plastic. On the weight side is not the lightest of laptops but I guess is the price to pay in terms off cooling and CPU power as other similar laptops as lighter but with lower core processors.The fast charging is good, I got it full charge from ~40% in around 2 hours. FHD display looks good.On the bad side, the camera. Grainy image and bad quality overall, I'm not sure if it is a hardware or software issue, but I think Lenovo should improve this even for entry level laptops.",0

"The Lenovo Legion 5 with RTX 3050Ti is an amazing gaming laptop for around the $1,000~ price point.While it is true that the 3050 and 3050Ti are the lowest tier GPUs of the RTX 3000 (mobile) series, for casual gaming this laptop delivers some great performance and graphics, do keep in mind that a lot of recent AAA titles won't play at the highest graphical settings compared to if you were using a higher tier GPU like the 3060, 3070 or 3080, but for the types of games I personally play, the 3050Ti still performs great at an affordable price.The device itself is very well built, the outside is made of plastic but it feels solid, the keyboard feels nice to type and game on, the trackpad is ok but using a mouse is preferable, speakers aren't amazing but don't sound terrible either, the camera is there and it's whatever but you at least get a switch to physically disable it at any time. The display on this is great, it gets very bright, the refresh rate is of 165z, and the color accuracy is respectable. Thermals haven't been a problem with the games that I've thrown at this device, there are three fans settings to pick from: quiet, balance, and performance, even at performance mode I can barely just hear the fans kick in when a lot is happening on the screen, plus this cooling pad that I got from ""havit"" seems to help it a bit.Maybe my only two nitpicks (that aren't too big of a deal for me to take stars away from this product), is that the keyboard has a number pad, which is more of a subjective taste but I personally just don't ever use the number pad on any keyboard, and the second nitpick is the fact that out of the box this laptop comes with 512* GB of storage (more like 475 GB considering how much storage system files take up), but on the bright side there is a second SSD slot inside the device so storage can be upgraded in the future.If you couldn't tell, I am very happy with this laptop so far, especially considering how I went from a laptop with an AMD A12 with integrated Radeon Graphics to a Ryzen 7 5800H with RTX 3050Ti, like, over half of my Steam library has now unlocked and become playable!(Also, say ""hi"" to my Clairen plush from the picture).",0
"for the price point this laptop is a good value, I have own many HP laptops and they have given me many years of great service",0
"- Very good build materials, doen't feels cheap.- Keyboard feels pretty good for a Laptop and it's full RGB- Fans aren't loud during gaming- Battery it's good enough for non-gaming tasksI just love it.Would recommend",0
"This one is a good size, well placed with good buttons.",0
"Was a bit of a hassle setting up a color profile to change the yellowness in the screen, but it ended up looking just fine. Really good at managing a large load of tasks at once. Battery life is a bit short.",0
"This is a solid computer for browsing and office work and the fact that it runs Android apps too makes it hugely useful, especially for its low price.",0
"UPDATE OCT 2022, this is a really great purchase. Still running like A champ 4yrs later !! I was expecting 2yrs. Lenovo has sold me on their products. I'll keep buying them.Title says it. I've had it for about a and no problems --- Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Laptop, High Performance Windows Laptop, (Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 10 Pro), 20KH002JUS.Great specs, great price. Really like how it very light weight.Responsive/prompt seller feedback",0
MSI chooses not to fine-polish the hard external plastic cover of the laptop so the micro scratches covering the entire laptop will collect every single dust particle and snack crumbs and other biologicals,0
"I read a bunch of solid reviews on this laptop, and watched many YouTube videos on it as well. I was very excited upon receiving this laptop. Obviously this is only my opinion, and I'm sure this is a great laptop. But my experience of it was horrible. Keep in mind I did not mistreat it at all, and this all happened on the day I received it.When I received the laptop, I couldn't even turn it on for a while. It was stuck on the Predator logo in the very beginning for ~1 hour. Which I don't think is usual? So I waited a bit more and it was still frozen on the logo. So I turned it off and on and it got stuck again. At this point I was thinking maybe I'm just not waiting long enough. So I wait for ~2 hours and still nothing. Finally I just lose my patience a bit and turn it off and on multiple times, with 5 min increments. On the 4th time it finally came alive and I went to set up Windows 10.Rough start I was thinking, but that was only the beginning. At this point I'm a little bit sketched out, but I'm pushing through it because after this is seemed to work fine for a bit. I downloaded my software, started to download a couple games and testing them. Worked really well. Really really fast. But after ~30 mins of playing a game, it crashed and all I saw was the blue screen of death.I rebooted everything, and it seemed to work fine for another ~30 mins. So I'm just chillin'. Maybe I did something wrong I thought. But then I left my screen idle for a bit and after the laptop went to sleep, it went BACK to the BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH. AND AT THIS POINT I'M MAD. So reboot it AGAIN, and begin testing it by closing the laptop/leaving it idle and just playing random games. Every SINGLE time I got the blue screen of death when the laptop went to sleep. Soon, I wasn't even able to reboot because it sent me to No Bootable Device.I read on some forums and saw some YouTube videos to fix this problem, because I still wanted it to work out. But at the same time, I thought to myself maybe I should just return it because the laptop is buggy.Anyway.. I want to give this another chance later because I actually really like it, but maybe not for now. I don't think this happens to many people, maybe I was just unlucky.",0
"I loved the laptop! The keyboard is soft, it is very light and thin, the charger was very practical, everything that I wanted. However the computer stopped working within 17 days of use. I was normally typing a text when the keyboard stopped working. Any button worked. Then I restarted the PC, but it was never turned on again. I put it on the charger to see if was a battery problem, but the lights indicating the charging process was off. Asus support told me that I could sent it to repair, but I preferred to return it anyway. It is really a bad sign when it has problems like this in less than one month of use. Amazon was really helpful to solve my problem.",0
Features and design are sleek and sophisticated.,0
This thing weighs almost nothing. Easy to use. Does everything my full sized laptop does. Very portable.Some techy folks will find something wrong with it--as they usually do.If you want something to write Word Documents and Excel spreadsheets--this is the one.I got it for the sole purpose of learning Python.I downloaded Python and PyCharm and I'm good.If you want it as a backup to do something in the go--get this one.,0
"Laptop works great for just about everything, one downside to this model is that it overheats easy and very noisy when playing high quality games. If don’t mind the noise and toasty laptop it’s not bad. I’m actually happy with it’s performance, reason I’m giving it a 1 star is because I cracked my screen (my fault) and sent it for repair and acer wanted to charge me 699.99 (bought the laptop for 1.1k) for the repair of my screen only. Mind u the screen cost $300 at their 3rd party parts sellers and $140 elsewhere. Meaning they are charging at least $400.00 for labor of a 10 minute screen change which I ended up doing myself and buying the parts (works perfect now). Great laptop horrible repair practices at acer repair center, so don’t break yours in anyway or be prepared to pay.",0
The shipping was fast arrive a day faster,0
I am particularly impressed with the build quality and the attention to little details,0
Love my new laptop... Perfect,0
"This is a low end, kinda underpowered machine. That's not a complaint, just the fact. I'm finding it useful for Office 365 in Chrome - don't bother with the Office apps. I also have the Fortinet VPN client to access the company VPN. And I found a good RDP client to connect to computers in the office. All in all, a good machine for the money for what I'm doing with it. And it's Android, so there isn't the maintenance overhead of a Windows machine. Buy em for your road warriors.EDIT 17 Jan 19 - I'm currently working to get the StrongSwan VPN client to working in order to connect Point-To-Site to my Azure VPN. I know it can be done, but getting the StrongSwan configuration correct is a bear. If anyone out there has used StrongSwan to connect P2S to an Azure VPN, send me a comment. Otherwise, I'll post when I get it working on my own. Why do this? So that I can access my Linux VMs via SSH and my Windows Server VMs via RDP.",0

I bought two laptops and planning to buy more during Christmas sale..,0
"Loved many aspects of this laptop, but key shortcomings made it a deal-breaker for me. I returned it after a long trial.I currently use my 14” Lenovo X1 Carbon as my only computer. I travel extensively with it nationally and internationally. I use my laptop for heavy writing and editing, financial work, and photo editing. I almost always use it on my lap, versus on a table-top.The Gram 17” caught my attention due to the screen, weight, and battery life. I sometimes edit with two documents open side-by-side and the larger screen seemed ideal.What I liked: Screen size and sharpness, weight (although same as my X1), battery life, and much cooler running than my X1 (also the exhaust out of the hinge area moves the head away from my lap).What I didn’t like:Keyboard: The keyboard is critical for me. This was is substandard. Many keyboard shortcuts that involve one or two simultaneous button pushes on the X1 require three on the Gram. Why they consolidated keys on a computer with this much real estate is a mystery. The touchpad is centered on the entire keypad, rather than over the letters. I found myself regularly touching the touchpad and inadvertently moving things around by accident. Very frustrating. The idea of a dedicated number pad (as on this unit) seems absurd to me for general use, but definitely doesn’t work for a writer/editor. Bottom line: The biggest problem for me was the keyboard layout.Screen: The screen is highly reflective. I mostly work in natural light with a mirrored wall behind me. In strong daylight the screen can be very hard to use.Proprietary charger: My X1 has a USB C charger, which I can also use for my phone. The Gram has a proprietary charger. Complete wasted of an input.Size: For travel, this computer is just a little too big. Hard to get into a standard laptop sleeve and on airplanes would be hard to open with a seat in front of me. I sometimes work for hours on a plane and even my smaller X1 is cramped in some cases.Wobbliness: Because of the size of the screen, when using on a lap, the screen tends to waggle a bit. Not a huge deal, but it’s the nature of a light laptop and large screen.What would change my mind: If they were to redesign the keyboard to center it on the letter keys, perhaps dropping the right side number pad altogether, the greatest impediment to use would disappear. They could also spread out the keypad and reduce/eliminate the need for multiple key presses. The screen needs to be non-reflective. I would prefer a version with a 15 or 16 inch screen to reduce the overall size. They should dump the proprietary charger.",0
I'm happy with the laptop but the battery life is not enough for a few hours gaming,0
"Is touchscreen, the keyboard is really nice and simple and is connected with google. Also each account has is own storage, the battery last a long time, and is very light.",0
I have had multiple issues with this laptop.1. The laptop refuses to balance on all 4 of its rubber feet which makes it extremely hard to balance it on any flat surface without experiencing significant screen wobble.2. The OS crashed and refused to do a complete system restore.3. Experienced terrible wi-fi issues (Public Network only) which turned out to be a driver issue that corrupted after Windows launched the Fall Creators Update4. Terrible fan rattling noise which definitely felt like there was something pushing against it.Overall I personally have had a very bad experience with the laptop and returned both the original and the replacement orders,0
"Sleek design, I wanted a gaming laptop that wasn't big and bulky... THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK... Plus it is 200$ off right now... Screen is nice sized, necromancer is excellent!!! CAN I SAY MORE?!? Has the college design with the guts for GLORY....",0
"I am writing this review one year after purchasing.At first loved my laptop! So nice, great graphics, got a little hot at times playing games, but that’s to be expected. All was well until one of the fans on the upper right started making horrible noises. When I say LOUD I mean obnoxiously loud. Could barely use the thing and playing games when I would push to talk everyone was like “dang is someone landing an airplane next to you!?” All together the fan stopped spinning and the laptop was getting so hot I couldn’t even touch the upper right part of the laptop. Many jokes were made by gaming friends about me playing World Of Warcraft with my laptop literally in flames.Anyways, to note: laptop was on raised platform with bottom completely exposed to airflow at all times and even added fan mat. This happened within my very first year of owning it brand new.** Acer does NOT pay for your return shipping** and recommended getting full coverage insurance. It cost me over $100 to ship the thing to their Texas facility of my OWN money. Terrible customer service to not provide the customer with a return label for your faulty product. They received my return in Texas February. Over a full month went by and NO UPDATES from Acer I had to call them and ask for anything and they were “waiting on a part.” Finally in APRIL I get a call they’re going to just replace my computer and I think, Well after TWO months I’d hope so. Only to call them back and find out they were giving me a “recertified”....not even a new laptop to replace the over $1k brand new one I purchased here on Amazon LESS than a full year ago. If you google you can read about the other people having fan issues with this laptop—believe them. Very disappointed in Acer on their poor customer service I received.",0
"La laptop es muy bonita, pero la desventaja que le vi es que no se si no leí bien las especificaciones pero el teclado está en inglés por lo que usamos un controlador para ponerlo en espa?ol, la situación es que obviamente el teclado está diferente a cómo se usa en mexico por lo demás la computadora funciona muy bien solo hay que acostumbrarse al teclado, el procesador rápido y por el momento no he tenido mayor problema",0
"After just a few weeks of getting this prodeuct, I REGRET of spending my money on this piece of ^%$#. Is not compatible with most of the printers, even ifthe printers or acer say they are, you ll be returning printer after printer. Some basic apps become just a dream on this product, the screen/cursor gets useles when try to scroll up/down, and the list goes on and on.DO NOT throw your money tothe trash, DO NOT get a lot of headaches tryng to figure out how you can solve a lot of issues, you ll be just wasting your time and money.For a few extra buks you ll be on the safe side and happy owning a dell/hp or even mac",0
We were excited about this new touchscreen laptop until the screen cracked less than a month after purchase. We were very disappointed in the quality of this product. Our previous HP lasted us years and unfortunately that was not the case with this purchase.,0
Remember that the Windows version is in window S mode.,0

"Muy buena Computadora, rápida, las teclas tienen luz, su bateria dura un buen tiempo",0
"I do a lot of video editing and it's relatively okay for that. But when it comes to just everyday work it's not easy to use. The cursor jumps around so you'll be typing in one place, but your cursor jumps somewhere else. So then you've got to figure out how much chaos you created in your document and try to fix it. It's very annoying.",0
"This laptop is pretty good for gaming as it holds its own on a gtx 1650. Ive seen worse battery life so it gets me through the day, but id definitely keep it on charge while playing anything as it performs infinitely better that way. Sadly it doesnt have any g-sync and it doesnt have the best screen but if your not doing something that need super accurate colors it'll works just fine! Over all i think acer did a good job on this laptop for the price.",0

"I bought my Razerblade directly from the company last November (2017) and was excited to finally have a premium laptop. I'm a developer by trade and this is my primary work computer. Not long after I got it, I started getting random blue screens. I contacted Razer and they had me do a factory reset. This didn't change anything and I still had BSOD issues.They had me send my laptop in for repair and after a little more than a week I got a new laptop in the mail. This one had the same issues. Went through the process again and ended up with a third laptop. This one finally seemed to work.... for about 4 months. Then it just up and died. Sent that one in and they replaced the motherboard and sent it back to me. I'm not sure if they are just recycling components but this one has all of the same BSOD issues the previous ones did.Would not buy this laptop.",0
Got it for grade school granddaughter perfect match,0

"At first I was hesitant because it seemed too good to be true but I honestly can’t say a negative thing about this little Samsong! It is super light and easy to use. I was able to get mine going right out of the box and at this price I purchased a second one for my two-year-old to play on. If you are questioning whether to buy one or not, just go for it!",0
The SSD portion of the computer allows instantaneous start and shut down to make a full restart occur in just seconds.,0
"Esta computadora funciona perfectamente para tareas de oficina. El entorno con el sistema operativo Windows 10 S está optimizado para que las aplicaciones oficiales de Windows funcionen de forma prácticamente impecable. La conectividad expandida se agradece, y la construcción del equipo se ve muy duradera. Con el uso esporádico de multimedia función más que decentemente, pero la pantalla se queda un poco corta por su espacio de color y ángulos de visión limitados.Este equipo muestra perfectamente cómo ahora las computadoras básicas de gama baja pueden ser optimizadas para funcionar con la velocidad de un equipo dedicado a tareas más especializadas y demandantes, sin tener que comprometer un bajo rendimiento en las tareas de oficina.",0
"Es un buen articulo aunque algo engañoso, si estás interesado en una garantía extra en México no tienen, la batería el primer día decía que duraba 4 horas hoy en día, a 1 mes de su compra, la batería dura a lo mucho 1 hora 50 minutos, la maquina tiende al calentamiento como cualquier laptop gamer pero si es ruidosa incluso en un modo ""equilibrado"". Por otra parte critico el teclado siendo está su versión de 17 pulgadas pudieron haber hecho una distribución del teclado más amplia como en sus predecesoras. En cuanto a su rendimiento es excelente, me gusta que tenga la tecnología híbrida de sdd y hdd. Por ultimo su cámara es bastante pobre uno creería que por este precio la laptop tendría una mejor y en una posición optima pero no. Otro punto en contra el lector de memorias sd no funcionaba debido a una incompatibilidad de este tipo de puerto con Windows 10 y no es algo sencillo de arreglar. Fuera de eso la maquina es buena pero no creo que sea mejor que sus equivalentes pasados de hace unos años.",0

"I bought this with an intention to also use for pave, it works, although steam displays a message the stats don’t work, he steamvr test passes with flying colors. I use this daily, for work and for play. With games such as Skyrim, hitman and beatsaber, I am impressed. My only issue with this might be the heat, but this is normal for a laptop considered the right space. This can be helped by buying a good laptop cooler base. So far so good, I would also buy a laptop cleaning kit, keep those vents clean!",0
This laptop is definitely a 5 star. I use it for gaming and the graphics are great for the price. I don't even have problems with lag anymore. I love the fact the keyboard even lights up.,0
Like it - disadvantage - buy and spend time for installation of the windows 10 pro.,0
"I liked the design and hardware included, however, had to reset it already due to an unknown problem with Windows that would not let me get out of S mode one I had already changed it to Windows 10 Home. This happened after a Windows bios update. Not a good experience with a new laptop.",0

"every older generation is practically the same, if you are interested in getting any mac the macbook air late 2015 model will fit all your needs and if cleaned properly will work like new. all airs can last extremely long. good quality laptop M1 chip is very powerful but 90% of users wont be able to use this mac to its full capacity honestly. But if you looking for an upgrade this is it, beautiful look, sleek design, light, powerful. will last from freshman year of college to well in post grad career. i say every mac with proper care can last a good 5-6 years then should be handed down to a friend. I gave my last mac book air (2015) away when I got this and my friends says the best laptop they ever had. again only mac worth buying new if you already own one and want to upgrade, 90% of those who will use it wont need the power and capacity it comes with.",0
"Will update as I learn more about the computerUPDATE 1: I have had this computer now for only two days, overall it's been a fairly nice two days. Didn't go as smoothly as I was starting it up for the first time. When I was setting my new password for some reason the ""5"" key on the numpad was not working, however it is miraculously working now. Also after noticing there was an update, I updated the laptop and when it was booting back up, after the log on screen it was just a black screen that wouldn't go away. I shut it off two times with no progress. However, after shutting off the laptop for the third time I decided to remove the Mouse usb, when I turned it back on it went back to normal and started as if nothing happened. It hasn't happened again. So that was a bit of a setback. Besides that, I've been having a smooth experience with the laptop. It's pretty fast. I will test the gaming aspect some time soon.UPDATE 2: I've had the laptop for a few months now, it's working very smoothly, it's fast when starting up, and I've had no major issues. I haven't tried playing any newer 'heavy' games but the witcher 2, LA NOIRE, murdered soul suspect, maple story, and skyrim run extremely well on it. I also use a drawing tablet on the laptop and I haven't had any issues with that either. It runs good. I just started the new college semester so I'm going to be using the laptop more frequently and I'll be using programs like Visual Studio and Autopsy so I'll update again soon!",0
"It's true, it gets really loudly, but u know that u a putting good stuff inside a small place, so it's normal that happens.You can customize the fans, the lighting, everything.

Terrible battery- I don’t get much more than 2 hours on it,0
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is the worst computer I've ever owned. I am returning it immediately. Setup was easy with Cortana, but slow. It took forever to boot up just to start doing anything. Launching the internet felt worse than dial-up. The internet application (Windows Edge, I think) froze while typing an email, and I had to restart the computer. I had a full wifi connection - so it was the application - not my internet speed. I used it for less than an hour and was so frustrated that I started the return process with Amazon (on my wife's MacBook Pro). It's taken over an hour to only complete ""3% of the factory reset"". I only completed setting up my mail account on this laptop, nothing else -- so the restoration to factory settings should only take seconds. Do not buy this computer.",0

"UPDATE: HP repair after many phone calls says the mother board went out after 6 weeks! They can replace, but will have to reset to factory settings, which will cause everything I had transferred from my old computers to be lost. OR, they will replace and send me the old hard drive, which I will then have to take to a 3rd party to try and save all that lost data,apps and programs. They won't transfer the data for me which means I will incur more costs for a 6 week old computer. Absolutely worthless customer service and repair and no one willing to actually be helpful and resolve the situation!1st review - Love HP normally. This computer is 6 weeks old and won't turn on. How can something only last 6 weeks? My life is on my computer. So bummed! I bought an HP Laptop from Amazon just about 7 weeks ago. It's now been in for repair since Aug 19th. It was supposed to take 2 days to fix. It wouldn't boot up. Then when I checked on the repair it was moved to Aug 28th. Now it's been moved to Sept 6th. I can't get an American to speak with. I'm having a hard time getting a supervisor. I can't get connected to repair. My whole life is on that laptop. I can't pay bills. Do any work. I'm dead in the water. The hard drive could have been simply put in another laptop. I'm so angry. How can I get help?",0

"Only had this computer for a few days so perhaps it’s too early to rate but so far I’m very pleased. It’s very slim and lightweight. The set up was super easy. It boots up almost instantly. The key board is easy to maneuver. The built in mouse pad works extremely well. The screen quality is very good & the monitor is bright. I only use it for basic things like email, social media, research, on line shopping, etc so it fits my needs perfectly. The battery life is decent. It came loaded with Windows 11 which is great but unfortunately Windows 11 is not compatible with my printer. The trade off is that Windows 11 is far superior to Windows 10 in all other respects. The test will be to see how long it all holds up. I’m optimistic though!",0

This is a very nice computer for the money. I like the silver but I would have loved a gold or Rosegold option as well. Also there is no touchscreen but it has a dual Intel processor which is what I needed for my podcast. Also the Video quality is not the best. I would suggest buying an external WebCam if you need the video quality to be better.,0

"When I first got this laptop it was everything I could have hoped for, the picture is beautiful, it runs games like a dream, and it's pretty quiet. Now that I've owned it for a couple years I can safely say it is a piece of junk.Less than a year after purchase, parts started failing. At first it was a fan, which was a cheap replacement, no big deal. Next the charging jack started overheating and began getting dead spots, I replaced both the charger and the jack. That fixed it for about a month, then the replacement jack started getting dead spots and eventually stopped working all together. I tried contacting technical support, but wouldn’t ya know it, my warranty had just expired so I would have to pay $700 just for the privilege of sending it in, not counting the cost to fix it. I decided I would try replacing the jack once more, but this time the new jack never worked.I finally caved and took my computer to a computer repair store only to learn the issue could be with the connection to the motherboard, which would mean it’s unfixable.I don’t know about you, but when I drop $1000+ on a piece of equipment I expect it to last longer than one of those $200 pieces of crap you can pick up at Walmart.",0
"I've called a 3ed party retailer that sells these laptops and was told all of these model's have slight back light bleed and its more of a lesser form of back light bleed. It really isn't noticeable unless you really look for in very dark games it and slightly noticeable during black transition screens.I've decided to keep this laptop because after going through 10 literally 10 different laptops this one really is the best. and here's why.No stuttering.Battery does not drain while plugged in and gaming.comfortable gaming keyboard.amazing quality screen 144hz 3ms response time is a game changer.Fan noise is reasonable. (other small laptops sound like a jet engine with high pitch noises.)Build quality is solid and looks great.Some negatives (very few)Slight back light bleed, not a deal breaker hard to notice.Single dim of 16gb ram requires you to buy another 16gb for duel channel memory to unlock its full potential, aka 20% of your fps are lost due to only single channel memory.",0

The first unit I received had a W key that would jam every time you pressed it. My replacement model had the worst backlight screen bleed I have ever seen on any IPS display. I just can't recommend a product when I am sent two lemons back to back.,0
"Maybe it's because I'm upgrading from an ancient desktop but this computer is blazing fast, runs everything at high settings and high framerates. Battery life is low if I'm running games with high graphics. Storage is only 512 GB which, after I had installed seven games and my Spotify collection, was 97% full already. No camera or BD/DVD/CD-Rom drive. Touch pad is ok but it's better to just get a mouse. Computer runs hot so make sure you have something between your legs and the laptop to counter the heat. My biggest complaint is that UPS was supposed to ask for a signature on delivery but they just left it on my doorstep. Thankfully I was home at the time and watching for it.",0
"The last gaming laptop I owned was an Acer Predator Helios from 2017. I ended up giving it to a cousin as a graduation present because my Surface Book 2 matched its performance and served me as a work laptop as well. I purchased the Legion 5 this year in order to gain better performance and extend the life of my SB2 by offloading all games.All I can say is: Wow, what a difference 3.5 years makes! The midrange Legion 5 is vastly better than a midrange gaming laptop from 2017, and at the same price.The display is the most immediately noticeable improvement. This 144hz display has really good black levels and brightness. Games really pop off the screen, and have never looked sharper. It is a non-touch panel with a semi-matte finish that does a great job attenuating reflections. There is a 720p webcam, which is pretty mediocre. But it has a privacy cover (nice) and I anticipate never using it.The internals are also really powerful for the price. The Ryzen 7 4800H/GTX 1660ti combo mops the floor with the Core i7 7700HQ/GTX 1060 of the Helios. I would say that, on the same games, performance increase is nearly double. What really impressed me though is how good the Radeon integrated graphics chip performs. There were some older games that were having trouble with the 1660ti, and the Radeon totally crushed them in terms of FPS and visual quality. When you can enable anti-aliasing on your internal chip, things are going pretty well.The package you get for the price is really solid. 512gb of SSD space with an expansion bay is a good value in my book. 16gb of RAM is enough for all but the most punishing loads. This laptop could also double as an Adobe workstation, as it crushes rendering and exporting tasks for programs like Premiere Pro and Photoshop. And it's in a tasteful body to boot, no ""Extreme"" gamer accents here! The only thing missing is an SD card slot, but that would really only affect buyers who want to do video editing or content creation.The fans do kick in on most 3D games, but only really get into high mode on more demanding titles like Jedi Fallen Order, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Arkham Knight, and Dead or Alive 6. With that said, the air being blown out by the fans is not terribly hot, so it seems clear the laptop is engaging the fans out of an abundance of caution. Ambient fan noise when not gaming is almost negligible, which means this would be a good work/play combo machine. You are offered some fan control with 3 modes: quiet/balanced/performance. The Quiet mode does reduce fan noise unless a game starts pushing heavy loads.All in all, I am gobsmacked by the value and performance. I had been holding off on a gaming laptop because my experience with the Acer had given me the impression that they involved too many compromises compared to my SB2. But the Legion 5 has really blown me a way. I recommend it wholeheartedly for anyone who wants a mid-range dedicated gaming laptop or a machine that can pull double duty for work.",0
"I use it primarily for gaming, and the refresh rate of the screen is INSANE",0
"This was my second Acer. The first one self-destructed after the screen encasement decided to come apart after two years of use. It served me well and was damn fast. I used it mostly for Photoshop. The Acer Aspire 5 is totally unusable for Photoshop and I had to return it. The Acer Aspire 5 is perfect for everyday computer use (surfing the web, email, watching videos). It is not meant for more advanced uses. Photoshop crashed and the laptop became unstable while I used it. A computer guy recommended Asus to me and that is what I'm using now.",0
"I bought this laptop basically for its Full HD IPS panel at a cheap price! HP 14-df0010nr (Intel Pentium Silver N5000 Processor,UHD Graphics 605, 4 GB 2400MHz SDRAM, 128 GB SATA SSD). Windows 10 Home in S Mode (WIN 10 Home OEM key in BIOS). Fan-less cooling (Totally silent!)",0
It's a nice Chromebook for the price I paid it does what I needed to do,0
"I purchased this laptop to replace an aging ASUS UX31A, which had served me well. This laptop felt like a worthy successor, until I tried out the webcam: it is non-HD, VGA, with 480 pixels of vertical resolution. I did not even think to check this before purchasing since my circa-2013 laptop had an HD webcam. If you don't care about the webcam, this seems like a great computer. I ended up returning it since I primarily use a laptop for video conferencing.",0
"With general working, emails, internet, etc the battery will easily last 5+ hours.",0
THIS laptop is excelente for my home use. Has everything I espected and need. Wood recomend .,0
"Awesome powerful gaming system. It powers up fast and shuts down easily. Updating the graphics card is an easy step through step process when needed it. The design is awesome. I love the lit up features. It doesn’t come with a mouse, so order a good simple gaming mouse or you’ll be stuck with the mouse screen.",0
"This laptop is great for competitive gaming. The 144hz screen is great, the response time is excellent, and the colors are nice. I mainly play FPS games and it suits my needs as a desktop replacement. I mainly play Valorant and get a very consistent 144 FPS. I would say that the laptop is not very portable as the battery life is not great however as someone who always keeps it plugged in, this is not an issue for me. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend this for anybody who wants a high powered gaming laptop.",0
the port on the right works like USB 2.0 in speed.,0
"Within two hours of unboxing and setting it up it started having issues with crashing and the BSOD. After spending 8+ hours on three separate calls to both Dell and Microsoft to fix my brand new laptop with no resolution for a repair, I had no choice but to return it. My issues may be isolated with this particular laptop, but I didn’t want to chance it with a replacement.",0
This one does not come with 2.5 SATA cable if you only ordered the ssd version. I consider it a trash move of Asus that you pay 2k cannot even diy. Do not buy the 2060 version,0
I love it,0
"I bought one for myself for online college, and it's perfect for me. This in I bought vfor my wife for her courses as well, it's perfect for her. It runs office and the camera is good for simple video chats or webinars.",0
"La verdad al principio me maravilló, luego vi que la ram era de 1600 y no 2400 y además la batería viene da?ada. Me entristece y decepciona que estafen con partes tan importantes como la RAM y la Batería.",0
"Excellent for gaming, runs quite hot but that is to be expected, only thing that disappointed me was the battery covers the 2.5 Bay. But has another m.2 to make up for it, still wish I had the bay, and the ram is easily accessible",0
First look the laptop is solid,0
This is a great little laptop! Everyone is talking about how slow it is but I was playing music on Spotify while also surfing the web and downloading two apps in the background and it still loaded websites very quickly! Over all 10/10 would buy again no need for an expensive laptop. The build quality is another good part of it. While it is all plastic it feels really nice even though it is lightweight. I don’t know if it would survive a drop or not but it feels pretty sturdy. The screen quality is good too. The one con I can think of is the fact that it comes with windows 10s but it only took a quick google search and about 5 minutes to change it back to normal windows. Also with a one year subscription to office 365 you are basically getting this for $55. ($155 when I bought it)If I have any future problems I’ll try to update this review and let you know:)Also sorry for weird writing style I don’t really know how to make a review flow well.,0
"First, I'll just tell you that, yes, this computer is incredibly awesome. Then I'm going to nitpick it as much as I can just to give you an honest perspective and hopefully some details you haven't already figured out.My last primary home laptop was an Alienware 17. It came out after Windows 8, but it ran 7 because everyone still hated 8. I knew it was getting old, but I didn't want to give up that super-high-quality feel. That computer was really large and substantial, which was both a fault and gave it a luxurious feel that I thought couldn't be reproduced. ...a long time ago, I had no real opinion of Asus, but then my Dad actually got a ROG at some point and I was sort of amazed that this brand that I would have almost considered generic at the time put out such a fine piece of hardware. So when I had a chance to get this computer, I knew it was good enough to replace the Alienware. And it is, absolutely. This computer is about half the weight and much smaller, but it still feels substantial and ""super premium"". This does have a compressed keyboard (the Alienware actually was wide enough to have a separate number pad), but it's spread out enough as to not be cramped or annoying. And thank God the Delete key is in an intuitive place! (I find that a problem with many laptops). As always, a new touchpad takes some getting used to, but I have it configured how I want it now, and I even finally gave in and started doing two-finger scrolling...I need to get these gripes out of the way, although they apply to almost all pre-built computers: Too much crapware and ads that won't let you alone at first (RE: McAfee), but not nearly as much as a lot of cheap computers. I hate that Microsoft won't even let you use your own hardware without getting you to make an account for their stupid software. I'm not sure you could even start using this computer if you don't have an active Internet connection (or they're making it harder and harder to find a workaround, but I'm getting too bored and jaded to bother fighting it anymore). Windows 11 at least seems to work well and look good, but they still have some super annoying features from trying to be too much like Apple. I just can't stand that we have some settings under Settings and others under Control Panel. I hate the Apple feel of Settings, but to have to use both is just stupid. Then you can't ungroup icons in the taskbar and I hate the button to turn off Wifi because it's too easy to hit. This is not a phone! OK...point is, I wish MS would respect its customers the way they used to.On to more specific nitpicks:1) Once in a while, I still turn on the number pad on the touchpad accidentally. This is a super cool feature, but I'm not sure if I'll ever get used to using it for typing in phone numbers and stuff like that. The overhead on having to tap and hold the corner first if a bit much, and then it's easy to forget to turn off. Of course, if you're doing spreadsheets, you'll probably be thrilled to have that on a midsize laptop.2) As usual, the included control center software, ""Armoury Crate"", is quirky in how it works with Windows. As with my previous Alienware, it's now only the second computer I have left such software installed and allowed to run (not sure you could get all the lights working otherwise), but it takes some fidgeting to get used to, and I had some issues with WiFi not coming back on and stuff that I attribute to this. At some point, you just have to give Windows back control of the power settings. Once I got it all working in harmony (basically just using ""Armoury Crate"" for the lights) it's doing fine. I'm still not convinced about leaving the other Asus software on there - it keeps bothering me about updating, but it seems redundant not only to Windows, but to Armoury Crate as well.3) The Screen doesn't tilt back quite as much as I'd like it to. I'm glad it seems to have a sturdy mechanism to hold it in place, but I could use just a few more degrees on a day like today: Sitting in a super comfortable chair with my leg crossed at 90 degrees, back of the laptop on the leg. I can still use it fine, but a few more degrees would be ideal.4) Another common problem: I wish they'd put twin power ports on the back and side of the device so you could pick which one you wanted to use. The battery is great, so I'm not using power now, but power out the back doesn't work with the position I'm sitting in described above. Also, I put it back on a small table near the couch when not in use, but it's slightly annoying to plug and unplug. Much of that has to do with the fact that there is a ""goiter"" (I think it's used to cancel out capacitance, but I'm not sure) on the power cord right near the barrel jack. This is just in the way and gets caught on the back of the table.BTW, the power brick is huge, which doesn't surprise me, but I absolutely love that you can plug in with power delivery, which means you can use this with a proper USB-C docking station. I guess you'll still want the power brick for hardcore gaming, but I love the option.5) No USB ports on the right side. Not a big deal, but sometimes you want the option depending where you are or how you're sitting. They use the space for some add-on thing they want to sell you instead...6) I get sick of trying to keep up with WiFi, but I actually just got a WiFi 6E AP, and it's awesome to be able to use it. I think they really did get rid of some latency there. It's pretty awesome when things get noticeably better. And I haven't even gotten the AP working optimally yet...Also 2.5Gb LAN port. I don't have a 2.5Gb capable switch yet, but I'll have to work on that because my AP has a port for that as well...7) I know everyone wants to hear about game performance: I haven't been able to bog this thing down with anything. I can play 2020s era games and have it transcoding for Plex in the background, and it barely spins up the fans. I mean, I can't give you anything but anecdotal evidence, so I'll leave that to professional electronics reviewers, but I'll just tell you it is as awesome as they say. At this point in time, I don't think there's anything this can't handle (at least that you'd likely be doing at home). And, just as importantly, it really is quiet and doesn't seem to run exceptionally hot, either. My last laptop could get so annoyingly loud.8) Battery. I was surprised to see the battery's Ah rating was barely higher than my previous computer, but then even more surprised how much better the power must be managed, because it'll more or less last all day if I'm just doing work-work (like spreadsheets and boring stuff) and web browsing. So it has the feel of a great all around, everyday type of computer (and you can even turn the lights off if you want to be low key), but then you can instantly turn it into a real powerhouse. You can have a profile for use with a docking station for work, one to maximize battery life for leisurely web browsing around the house, and one for use with the power brick as a gaming rig. Versatility is fantastic.9) I had some weird quirks early on, and called customer service. One thing was the WiFi I was talking about earlier and one was the screen doing weird stuff. I partly called customer service just because I wanted it on file that I was having issues in case I did need a repair. Normally I wouldn't just because I normally know better than they do... But I got a real person quickly and he gave me non-condescending advice and made a file for me. I just had to do some random driver updates and it seemed to work. Now, I don't think things should ship needing updates, but...at least they have real customer service.Well, I could probably pontificate for 10 times this long, but the conclusion is that after the minor pains of changing computers and getting used to some slight hardware differences, getting past the frustration of Microsoft and a few typical antivirus program ads, doing little tweaks to get the touchpad working for me instead of against me, and screwing around with updates until my problems went away, I am 100% happy with the computer. Not just happy, but thrilled. This is the kind of hardware that once you experience as your own, you really can't go back. This not only has all the computing power and features you could want, but it's also cool in every way.",0
Fast as lightning with i7,0
The build quality is excellent,0
"This is definitely a gamer's laptop. I was able to play my Xbox Anywhere games without any problem. I didn't notice any lag. It felt like I was playing the game on my Xbox One.The only thing that's awkward for me is the touchpad. I prefer the touchpad in the center. However this laptop has it placed toward the left side. If I was left handed it would be great, but I'm not. However, I am adjusting.With that said, I still give it 5 stars because the processing power and the amount of hard drive storage is so great.",0
"I've been pretty happy so far. Good security because it's chromebook. No problems. Screen could be better, keyboard is not illuminated.",0
Gets super hot from the bottom (77c at max setting) and my RGB keys aren’t working well.,0
great for gaming and anything else you do....not top of the line but good enough,0
Very disappointing. The laptop is not charging and I bought it for my son who needs it for school. I plan on returning item as soon as I find out how to do so. Also in the title it says it was an Aspire E15 laptop and I got an E5. Don't go the cheap way unless you know the product is of great quality.,0
The screen was literally flashing the other day and I have had the laptop for less than 3 weeks. When I restarted the device it stopped. But definitely alerting. If it happens again I will contact Amazon and return it. Def will update the review as well.UPDATE: it's 2021 & I still have my laptop. Works great. No more problems and I just think it's worth every penny. I changed the rating to 5 stars too. Great buy.,0
"I bought this system knowing it only had 512 Meg SSD, but everything I read online stated you could add another hard drive. This is false, you cannot install another internal drive. There is a slot, a bracket but no connector to hook a cable to... There is an upgrade document that says you can do all of this.. This is my 5th Asus Laptop.. You've lost a customer.",0
Just what i wanted,0
Computers touch screen stopped working after a week every time you close this laptop it has a chance to crack the screen shuts to hardJust not a good laptop for the price,0
I bought this computer from Samsung. It ran fine and was doing well. I was out of town and put it into my sleeve in my back pack and sat it next to a chair. When I reached back in to get the computer the screen had a break from one corner to the other. Nothing had taken place. No dropping. No pressure. The screen just broke. I sent it to Samsung since it's still under warranty and they said I have to pay to get it fixed.,0
"This is a great deal for a high quality computer! It just arrived today and setup was incredibly easy and I was able to start gaming right away. I was a long time MacBook user and initially worried about the transition to PC but this computer is very user friendly and provides a perfect balance between your typical laptop needs (email, work, etc) and gaming. If you are an Apple user thinking about converting - do it now! This price point is excellent for the quality computer you are getting.",0
Strong hardware.,0
I bought this for my 84 year old mom who struggles to manage the computer. A laptop/desktop were too cumbersome and takes up too much space in her home. This is portable small and can easily be tucked away when she is finished. It is easy for her to use...very easy to set up and get her email which is why she wanted a computer!!! I enlarged the text and she now watches her soap operas and other shows. I also got her a wireless mouse which I highly recommend!! She now loves using the computer!,0
Great Chromebook for high school and college student.,0
The screen lacked contrast and had glare.,0
"What a great buy ! Screen is incredible, keyboard is soft to use, great Buy ! Very Happy.",0
The laptop was defective out of the box. The audio does not work and only produces a clicking like noise and no other sound. Spoke with the tech support and they said I had to send it in for repair and did not offer full refund even though they’re at fault.Power wise it runs games great. I just couldn’t hear anything.,0
I play counter-strike: global offensive and having a laptop with a high refresh rate screen was very important for me.,0
"My daughter was begging for a Mac computer and now that she has this chromebook, she is so happy. It is sleek, lightweight and fully functional for her needs. She is thrilled with the ease of use and getting to know this operating system is a snap.",0

"This laptop has an awesome GPU and processor for the price. So far, the combination of the 10th generation Intel processor, ray tracing GPU, and 144hz monitor, have enabled this laptop to handle the most graphic intensive games and animation programs I have. Will be using this for schoolwork, gaming, animation and video production. I have no doubt it will take any graphics intensive games or processor intensive apps thrown at it, without missing a beat.",0
"I was looking for a fast laptop for work and that would allow me to play games occasionally, I wanted better than integrated graphics but I didn’t want to pay thousands of dollars so I got this computer with the lowest expectations.To my surprise, it is a an awesome computer, not heavy and easy to carry, very good looking, well built with a nice design. I take it to work every day and it doesn’t even look like what it really is (A gaming laptop) it boots Windows 10 in 1 sec, runs everything I throw at it even my old games at max settings (LoL, AOE3, SC, SC2, C3)The one I purchased came with the i5-9300H and the GTX 1650, 8GB Ram and 256GB Nvme SSD.So far the best laptop I have owned.",0
"I have ordered 2 of these laptops and both have the same problem -- they don't charge. The charging light (amber) goes on for 1 second and then turns off. What a shame. After resetting the battery via the power button as suggested in the Acer forum, the problem persists. Apparently this a known issue with the Acer 515-56 models. I am surprised Acer is allowed to sell a defective model like this. Save yourself the trouble of having to send it back and wait 2 weeks for a refund from Amazon",0
We have an Acer laptop but this one was difficult to maneuver. I returned it and bought a cheaper chrome book at Costco I liked much better.,0
"Overall, a very good quality, good looking, and good performance laptop for the price with acceptable fan noise. That said, the 4gb v-ram is the biggest blow to it's performance as some newer you intensive titles struggle at the highest settings. keep in mind that it isn't the most portable and light weight of laptops, making it a bit more difficult for always having it in you bag.",0
"Love what you get for the price, battery life is great as well as screen quality",0

"I am a previous owner of a ASUS UX31A that I bought in mid 2013. It finally wore out, I liked it so bought this one as a replacement. Though it is fine there are a few unadvertised changes that irk me. First, this one does not open nearly as much as the UX31A. The UX31A would open almost 150 degrees, this one only to about 130 degrees. I have already run into operating situations where this I miss the old spec. For instance if the laptop is on a kitchen counter and you are standing to use it -- you really want that extra opening angle. Second, the UX31A power supply was made so the two prongs would fold back into the body of the power cube. This was great when you threw it into your carry case so the prongs would not poke into anything. Not so with this new one. They stick out and that's it. The UX31A came with a slip case. Not this one. Finally the speakers on the UX31A were on a bar in front of the function keys. On this one they come out the bottom of the case. Sound can be muffled. In my mind 3 poor design decisions and one just cheap cost saving measure. Now I am disappointed. If I had known these things I would have looked around some more before purchasing it.",0

"Its functional. It has a top of the market mobile processor, decent ram, decent SSD, ect.It will perform nicely for the price.The deal breaker for me was the screen. I'm not picky at all but its really washed out. I've had really nice TN screens before but nothing like this. Returning it now.If you don't mind how the screen looks and just want performance, go ahead and pick it up, everything else is fine, but I can't see myself watching youtube or netflix on this, its that bad.",0

"Ordered the Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 (Model XE520QAB-K02US) as a replacement for my Samsung Chromebook Pro which I passed on to my wife because her 6-year old Samsung Chromebook was no longer receiving updates. Received it yesterday and was shocked to see that it has an Intel Core m3 7th Generation processor (see photo of label) and not the 8th Generation depicted in Amazon's advertising. (See Screenshot) Also surprised that entire case is plastic, including the keyboard deck. From what I understand this originally came with metal top and keyboard deck with plastic bottom. All plastic makes it very flexible and it just feels cheap, more like a $200 chromebook and not the build quality you'd expect in a chromebook in this price range. Will be sending back, expecting a full refund because it is not as advertised.",0

Scratches on left side of key board looks renewed Im disappointed,0
"Okay, so I was hesitant on this laptop because some of the reviews mentioned bad temperatures. I was concerned with getting a laptop with bad thermal paste (which does happen). However, the laptop came super well! Lots of reviewers fail to mention the healthy temperature levels. Idle should be 30-45c. And under full load it should never go past 85c. EVER!!! If it goes past, it's likely it could either be, 1: Bad Thermal Paste/application, 2: Bad Fans, 3:Lack of contact with HeatSinks. 4: Bad Ventilation. If buying new, and the temps aren't matching, exchange it, as shipping can sometimes damage components. Laptops generally require maintenance. If heavy using, 1-2 Years. Make sure those temps never go past 85c. Over time you will have to replace the thermal paste or fans may give out. Grizzly Kryonaute is the best paste. Those are very very easy fixes. Just keep that in mind when buying ANY gaming laptop! If you are scared to tamper with it, buy some insurance and send it to acer. (Continuing with the review......) With poor ventilation I was reaching 85c. I bought a laptop cooler, the IETS with rubber rings. I'm getting incredible temperatures! Never going past 78c! This laptop is very heavy on proper Ventilation. If you look at the design there are a ton of vents from the bottom that push out through the top of the keyboard. S1I think a laptop cooler is necessary if you're gonna be gaming. This thing is incredible. I'm running games on High/Max settings (Elden Ring, warzone, apex) and getting awesome frames. I upgraded the ram to 32GB and this thing is a work horse. Dual rank 3200 32gb ram will increase your frames by about 15, and more opened tabs!! ;) I also installed a 2tb samsung ssd. (Which I highly recommend you do) It is much easier to install an nvme than the SATA one. So I would recommend getting a m.2 nvme. Opening the back piece for upgrades can be a challenge. There Is a trick to it, and it's likely you will break something if you don't get it right. So don't force it! So be very careful and gentle when doing it. Use a pick to slowly Pry it open. Pull from the vents back side. The battery can get kinda hot too. So make sure it's in a good spot. You can also set the battery charge level to 80% for longer battery lifespan. That's pretty much it! It's an amazing laptop for the price and power! Bang for your buck! Happy gaming!",0
"Excelente en compra, me llego superrapido ya que se habia presupuestado 2 semanas, pero me llego en 5 dias y todo perfecto. muy contento los recomiendo",0
Dead 6months later. Do not buy this laptop if you want it to last more than a year. I actually own two of these. One that I bought from target in 2018. This one died 1 month ago after I had purchased the second one from amazon. I had assumed my amazon purchase was a new unit. But checking the serial number now to make a warranty claim revealed it was also a 2018 unit. So two of these computers died at just shy of 2 years of life. Not a well made or reliable product. I’m extremely annoyed about my second purchase that resulted in only 6 months of use time. Do Not Buy this!!!,0
"This laptop is great! have heard bad reviews about keyboard, but its fine. Speakers are on bottom of laptop so sound is soft at times, and screen doesnt tilt back as far as id like but minor flaws, great hardware and laptop for the price!",0

I just recently got this computer it's been good I have not had no problems I've been running everything as smooth as butter the screen looks gorgeous it's worth the money,0
"This laptop has been extremely frustrating. Boy do I regret buying it. I wouldn't recommend buying it. Don't get me wrong. It's aesthetically pleasing, light and all. But this is no good if the laptop doesn't serve your primary reason for buying it - to access wireless connections. Mine is a CORE i5 8th gen. It doesn't recognize wireless connections. However if I hotspot with my phone, it immediately picks up the hotspot connection. A quick check on google for similar problems indicates that this is a persistent problem with ASUS. I have done various things recommended to troubleshoot such as disabling and enabling the network drivers, uninstalling and installing them too. Occasionally this works, but mostly it doesn't - like today. Even when it does, I have to make several attempts of disabling and uninstalling the network drivers. It's got to a point where I don't bother using it. I bought it in February 2019 and have used it less than 10 times If anyone has any additional tips of what I can do to resolve this issue, I'd love to hear. At this point, I'll try anything!",0
The accessory plug ins are really nice on this model with a substantial memory.,0
"This Macbook was good until the screen started to glitch on the bottom and left side of the display. Apple said the screen didn't have damage, but needs to be replaced. It's 14 months old, outside of the one year warranty, and a new display costs $428. I will not be buying another Macbook in the future.",0
"I was so excited to replace my old lenovo touchscreen computer with this one....nice colors, etc...didn't read the description very well. Needless to say they let me return it. Thanks Amazon. I'll do better next time",0
"This is a piece of crap. However, I am keeping it. It is stunningly slow, but so cheap it represents a good value. Especially for travelling.",0
Im writing this review on this laptop.Im pretty satisfied with the quality of this laptop with gaming and regular work use. Appears to be a great value. Battery has been great and the colorful keyboard lighting up is real nice when working in a dark room.Overall i am quite happy with my purchase.Also was real easy to upgrade the ram and put a additional SSD in.,0
"No complaints. Fast, sleek, comfortable. Very happy w/ it. Will update this review if anything goes haywire.",0
Perfection !!!!!,0
Battery died after 9 months...3 months after warranty ended. Now need to test Samsung's customer service. UPDATED: After some phone calls (not too bad) finally got a number of an authorised Samsung repair center in my area. They said battery issues were common on this device and cost would be ~$150.00 for new battery & labor. I'm also responsible for shipping. After spending on the high end for a chromebook I now have to spend $150 more after 9 months of use. This is a chromebook for my school aged son that needs it for online HS classes so I have no choice. I have several Samsung products in my house so very surprised of the poor quality I'm seeing here. I cannot recommend a Samsung Chromebook to anyone.,0
Hola tengo problemas con esta lap se reinicia a cada rato y no te deja entrar a ningún navegador de internet porque se reinicia cuando quiero abrir mi correo también se reinicia no se cual sea el problema mejor la voy a devolver,0
it's a little off-putting when you have your game drowned out by the sound of a noticeably loud whirring of laptop fans.,0
"First of all, this is a big upgrade for me. My previous laptop was a Toshiba C55 with Intel i3 4th Gen proccesor, 8gb DDR3 ram and a 256 SSD. I was ok with that laptop but I felt that I needed an upgrade. Man I made the right decision!This laptop has everything I've wanted in a computer, except the graphics card of course. All in all, I'm really happy with the purchase.Pros:1. This laptop is thin and light. I can definitely take this laptop anywhere without noticing that I really have it with me.2. I've seen some comments that the sound is bad. Well guess what, It's not bad at all. Not the quality of a Mackbook pro, but come on, for the price? It actually sounds pretty good. Those two speakers in the bottom, when hitting against the table, it bounces off giving a really good base sound, allthough they have the potential to get a bit louder, but that aside, it's great for a laptop this thin.3. Others say that the screen is horrible. I don't see anything horrible about it. It's not full IPS quality, but the 1080p screen looks pretty good. Again, taking you back to the price, can't beat it.4. The backlit keyboard is beautiful! Even though the keyboard needs a bit more work (make it feel more clicky), the white backlit makes this laptop look like a pro when putting it side by side with other well known brands out there.5. There's enough peripherals for what I need. Comes with 2 USB's on the left side, 1 USB-A on the right side, HDMI, USB-C and the sd card slot. Not bad for the size of this laptop. Enough for a thin laptop. Unfortunately it didn't come with an ethernet port, which I use a lot for a more stable connection, but that's what external usb network arapters are for.6. Extra slot for another 2.5 HDD/SSD. Not many laptops at this price range have that, so I'm really glad this one does in case I want to expand my storage a bit more.7. The battery life is just great. The first time I fully charged it, I used it for about 5 hours and it still had some juice left. I think I could have used it up to 6 hours for me to charge it back again. I used it with minimum backlit brightness and about half screen brightness. Not bad at all. Oh, and the charging time, amazing, from 10% to 100% in about an hour, could have been lessCons:1. The flex cable adapter for the additional internal HDD/SDD is not included in the box. I believe this should be included all the time for all of the laptops that offer the chance to expand the storage. Not much of a biggie though, you can find that adapter in amazon for about 12 bucks.2. Cannot upgrade the ram further than 16gb + the integrated 4gb that's soldered into the motherboard. This is unfortunate since it would have been a great oportunity to add some options to update the RAM to 32gb.As you can see, there are way more pros than cons, so you can definitely tell that I really like this laptop. Give it a try, I totally recommend it.",0
It doesn't overheat the keyboard like other gaming laptops.,0
The look is sleek and impressive.,0
"This is a fast, well-optioned machine inside",0
"Overall is a great laptop, only reason for it is the fan sometime are annoying.",0
"The Lenovo Legion 5 Gaming Laptop is my second laptop from Lenovo, but my first gaming laptop from the company (I have had one other gaming laptop in the past from another brand.) When I lifted it out of the box, the first thing I noticed was that this is a large heavy computer with a giant power adapter. It's a big robust machine, best for setting up in your home gaming area or office, and probably not the best choice if you want something particularly portable. This computer is a great budget gaming laptop with the power you need to run your favourite games, and great graphics and solid sound quality to provide a good immersive gaming experience (for a single screen and laptop.) You can make all kinds of tweaks and adjustments to get the sound the way you like it, but without headphones or any changes to settings, I have to say I was quite impressed by the sound quality (and high VOLUME capability) right out of the box.On start up, it does run Windows 10 and requires you to either log into an existing account or make a new account. Unlike with some other gaming machines, when you're logged in, there's not a lot of indication that this is a gaming laptop apart from a couple of subtle hints (like xbox app pinned to the task bar, for example.) It's is a fairly no-nonsense computer, without the bells and whistles found on other gaming machines (lights and effects, for example.) It does offer some set-up options where it asks what your intended purposes are (gaming only, gaming plus work, or work only) and then offers a variety of suggestions to optimize settings for your intended uses.Although you can also use this laptop for regular everyday use, or for work or school, there are a few things that set it apart as a gaming laptop. For one, the ports are not easy to insert into, nor are they easy to let go of. No chance of your connections slipping out during furious gaming. It was practically a struggle to get my usb mouse receiver in and out of the slots. I've noticed this seems to be more of a common feature on gaming laptops, and it's great if you plan to get your work or gaming station set up a certain way, and don't need to pack up or move around much. I love that the entire keyboard surface is rubberized and seems a bit more rugged than on other computers. Finally, THERE IS A NUMERIC KEYPAD! This is something that's clearly very exciting to me. I know you can get laptops that have it, but it isn't very common. The keyboard layout of this machine is awesome for both work and gaming. The keyboard IS a bit more spacious than I'd normally like for typing (keys are just a bit more spread out than I'm used to with other laptops and keyboards I've used in the past) but it's marginal and it's something that only takes a day of use to get used to. Unlike with my old gaming rig, this one doesn't run super hot or burn my wrist blowing hot air out the side, so I do appreciate that.Overall, this is a great machine. I would say that if you're looking for a hybrid laptop that has the design and features to pull double duty for both serious work and serious gaming, this one is a good pick, assuming the specs meet your needs. You don't get the little extras some gaming computers offer (like light up visual features and customizable glowing lights) but you also don't pay the extra that those things would cost. (If you're into that, it's cheaper to buy some LED strips and stick them to your desk, anyway. ?)",0
"I really like this compact, fast, efficient laptop for browsing and other work.",0
"Bought this for my son, who plays a lot of games on Steam. It's been great. The fact that it has a graphics card really sold me on this. It's been a great laptop. Well-made and easy to set up. We're all glad with this purchase.",0
"I am surprised about how lightweight this Asus is. It is perfect for school because it won't hurt my back from carrying it around with me.I was initially disappointed because I thought the keyboard did not light up, but you have to press the fn and f4 buttons. So far so good.It sucks connecting to wifi. It’s not the wifi because everyone around me gets connected quickly. When I am in class or go to the school library, it takes a while (sometimes 30 mins) to connect.Another update: I still have trouble connecting to wifi even in my home. Like mentioned before, other devices don’t have any trouble connecting but this computer keeps having trouble connecting and staying connected to the internet. I know for a fact that the internet is not the problem.",0
"Speed of machine is excellent. Perfect for my son's 1st gaming machine. Picture and sound feel good. Camera quality is not great. Charging plug unit is bulky, not advisable for traveling a lot with.Overall works great for what I needed it for.",0
This was such a waste of money. I can only blame myself because I didn't do the research before purchasing it. I can't even sell it to a kid.,0
"I really enjoy this computer, but there are a few caveats.1) The audio for recording is not the best. And in order to turn off certain features like the background filter, you HAVE to sign up for their MyAsus account to have more control over features there. Why should we have to use an outside site to control features on a personal computer.2) The screen color isnt bad, but it isnt crisp. Feels like it has a haze filter over the screen.3) Definitely NOT for gaming, but I didnt buy it for that.All-in-all, it works well for what I need (work/organization), but not sure how well it would work for anything visual or complex editing.",0
"They sent the wrong color, but it's otherwise great",0
"This chromebook does not have an HDMI port like it says it does. I already have a second monitor that I intended to use. In addition, chromebooks are hard to get adapters for to go from USB 3 to HDMI. Most require a drive that only works with Windows. I've liked chromebooks but I'm going back to PCs since I need something that works well with a second monitor.",0
This is so bad that more than half the screen is brown even when you are playing games.,0
This is the worst screen I've ever used on a laptop. It looks too cheap. After coming from a Macbook Pro I tried this laptop for a little coding and I just can't do it for more than 2 hours. I have to use it with an external monitor,0
amazing. great product you should get it now,0
"This laptop is for sure one of the best laptop for everyday use, and works great for almost everyone. The design is chic and simple. It's very light weighted so easy to carry with you anywhere you want or even travel with. The sizing is perfect as it has 15.6"" monitor so still pretty big size to be able to do any work with. For the price, it's super powerful and works great even for some graphic and architectural design works and applications. It's slim which is exactly how I like.",0
"DOA. did not turn on.UPDATE: they sent me a new one, I've been using it flawlessly for about a year and a half. It's been great.",0
There were no setup or operating procedures in the box.,0
Showed a little more wear than I expected. Seems to work of.,0
I do a lot of work online with our website and this is the perfect computer!,0
Product met my expectations in every way I was looking for a small convenient laptop and this certainly did thr trick!,0
the holes collects dirt easily and are not easy to clean,0
It is very fast and has a beautiful display.,0
"Three stars because of the speakers being on top and not at the bottom of the laptop. Also because I function around Google so it's convenient to have a Chromebook. I didn't like that it doesn't have a right click function. It's an okay laptop, especially if you're just using it for simple stuff. I think I'll just spend a little more for more features.",0
"So I’ve had this just about 3 weeks , I love it!!! Do yourself a favor get the 1050ti it really boosts this laptop. The ssd makes this thing boot up really fast and smooth, the i7 is new to me I use amd I’m very impressed with it. Gaming on this thing is nice I haven’t found anything that won’t run ultra I’m sure there is some but not many. I also just got into video editing and this really does a great job at it. The turbo boost fan keeps this running cold. Overall I’m in love with this laptop it’s lightweight battery if not gaming goes about 4 hours a little less gaming maybe a 1 hour time.",0
"I've had this laptop for a year and a half now. It ran okay until the right side fan suddenly started making this ugly, unbearable grinding/buzzing noise. Right after the warranty expired (of course). Checked for dust and cleaned, tried to adjust the fan speed, nothing helped. The only way to make it stop is to open up the laptop and unplug the fan. Don't waste money on this.",0
extremely pleased with the Chromebook for my 10year old son.,0
"Visually, the laptop is appealing with the classic Alienware design and illuminated heads adorning a slate gray lid (with no latch).",0
Gave to Grand kids for Christmas and they were playing on them in 15 minutes. They love this little unit and I can't believe the price for the quality!,0
"I'm a heavy user and completely in the cloud and this is my only computer. I use it for business. I have it linked to my Android Note 8 (through a third party Chrome app) and it's seamless. It will run apps from the Google Play store. I usually have many multiple tabs open, expect it to operate like a full blown PC laptop and it generally does exactly what I want it to do. I watch videos, do photo editing, type thousands of words a day on it, stream movies and create Google Docs, Slides and Sheets. I bought this to replace my three year old version of the same Chromebook because all of the letters were worn off the keyboard and some of the keys weren't working ... I'm actively using my Chromebook probably 8 or more hours a day so it would probably last even longer for most people. It's lightweight and fits easily in a tote or backpack. It holds up well. I use it sort of all day and night and I haven't found anything it won't do. The only place I notice this being slow is ironically when I open up Google Inbox and then I get to practice patience for a minute. Occasionally it will get sort of slow and then I'll go to settings and clear the image cache and that takes care of it. I handle a lot of images so the memory fills up a bit after a while. It comes with 100 gigs of free storage for two years from Google and I'm sold on Chromebook. I usually run it off home wi-fi but I can also tether it to my phone or use public wi-fi. The bluetooth connects easily to everything. The keyboard is nice. I type 100 wpm and I like the keyboard and touch pad a lot. The keys are responsive and quiet. It's a nice, clean, simple design and easy to keep clean. The only thing I wish Samsung would do is make a little indent where the power cord goes in to help guide the plug in because you kind of have to look when you're plugging it in. The power cord is super compact and is just the plug and cord with no big clunky thing on it. I've been able to find cloud based solutions for every piece of software I was using previously and I don't miss the PC at all since I went into the cloud in 2015. I really don't miss having to constantly update my system and all of the software. Google updates are super fast. You basically just restart and you're ready to go. It boots in seconds although I usually just leave it on constantly. I set my browser downloads to save to my Google Drive so there's no personal information stored on the Chromebook at all. It's under $200 and it's better than my $1200 PC laptop I replaced when I switched to Chromebook three years ago. It's absolutely silent. No fans grinding away. I sit with it in my lap all day long and it never gets hot. I don't play video games but I imagine that it would play cloud-based games fine. I've inadvertently had more than a dozen YouTube videos playing at the same time and it was sort of noisy but it wasn't lagging. And when you want to replace it, you just backup anything you've stored on the small hard drive and run the power wash on it. The only program I couldn't find a cloud solution for was Scrivener. But now you can get a virtual hard drive in the cloud for a fairly reasonable monthly rate and run any software you want on the Chromebook. It holds up to constant use and it's really sturdy despite being really slim and lightweight. The screen hinge is super strong and it's hard to imagine it breaking unless you dropped it.",0
"The power it packs on the size, temperatures and weight it has is astonishing.",0
"The keyboard numbers are almost impossible to see unless you're in just right position and in bright daylight. I had to buy a keyboard cover so I could see/read the characters. Otherwise, happy!",0
"This Chromebook is excellent. The setup was easy, log into your gmail account and everything is there. I already use Google docs and Google drive, so all of my files were immediately available. My music is on Amazon, which is cloud based, so it too was accessible. If you use cloud based software, you'll love this, no more Windows! The item was in perfect condition, the price was outstanding, and it arrived quickly. I couldn't ask for more.",0
muy recomendable me ha dado un excelente rendimiento para solid works 2017 me gustaria que le agregaran un led para distinguir si esta en mayusculas o minusculas,0
It’s slow and I don’t like the controls it’s not a good laptop too for school,0
"I read alot of reviews about numerous issues with the x1c6 but mine has had no issues at all. my only complaint at all is the fingerprints easily left on the outer case. besides that this is a serious work laptop. super fast, super light & portable. love it.",0
"Thanks Amazon for supplying this item for this price.Plus+ Powerful CPU and GPU > smooth experience in most of the games+ Nice screen+ Works silent if not playing games+ Fast SSDMinus- No Linux drivers > many functionality does not work- There is a bug in windows sound driver, sometimes sound goes off, need to mute and unmute to have sound back (Fn+F1)",0
"It is overall a good buy. I like it. it has great resolution, the RAM ran fast as expected for the price i paid for.its a very good configuration for regular work and browsing feels solid, looks solid. solid as i genuine in parts.i also like the color the packaging was great. that i loved.",0
"This laptop is probably just fine for someone else, but I returned it for a full refund due to the lack of facial recognition software and a keyboard without backlighting. Facial recognition is a great way to unlock a laptop, and can also be used in place of a password for many websites. My condo is usually dimly lit and a keyboard that lights up makes a huge difference. It was a mistake to order this laptop.",0
"If you like products that are overbuilt and perform similarly, this is the laptop for you. It has every feature I desired, including a DVD drive (It's getting harder to find good laptops with this feature, which is a ""must have"" for me). It's one of the heaviest laptops I've ever owned, but that's because it's built like an M1 Abrams tank. I don't mind toting it around and consider it a bonus - gym equipment. Besides excellent performance, the refurbishing dealer offered it at a cost that feels like I shoplifted it - not the original sub $2000.00 price tag. I love bargains that work. That's why I just purchased a second unit.",0
"complied with all specifications published in the description, very good buy I recommend it",0
"It is also surprisingly easy to write on, the pen has a feel almost like writing on paper with a little bit of grab so the pen is not just sliding.",0
it works,0
"I'm a student who does all of my work on my laptop and 2 months in, I'm really liking it!Some people are complaining of a black screen after a week or two of use which is really unfortunate and should be fixed on Acer's part, but the machine itself is wonderful in my opinion.Pros:+ Light (1.2kgs), portable, fits easily in any bag.+ Crazy fast boot times and storage speeds. Shut down to log in in less than 7 seconds. Having only an SSD helps!+ The display is actually quite nice, I think. Good colors, small bezels.+ Build quality is good, minimal keyboard flex.+ Battery life is pretty damn good. I'm averaging about 7-9 hours with web browsing, and some video.+ Trackpad is fairly large, responsive, Windows precision drivers, so gestures work smoothly.+ Backlit keyboard is comfortable to type on.+ Fingerprint scanner takes a little while to get used to, but now it works for me quickly about 95% of the time.Mehs:- Hinge is pretty stiff tbh, takes 2 hands to open the laptop.- To my knowledge the ram is limited to 8gb, (though somewhere I read you can max out to 12 gigs).In general, the experience so far has just been really convenient and quick. From the bag to logged in, ready to work takes only a few seconds and 2 months in, I couldn't be happier!",0
notice the mouse pad has a few issue dragging in the top right and lower left corners,0
I bought this laptop to use for music production to replace my HP all-in-one PC that kept shutting down on me when I switched between DAWs and ran multiple plugins at the same time. Ths Lenovo Legion is up for the job. The 16 gb Ram works great although i plan to expand to 32 gb in the future. The 512 GB SSD is sufficient for all my DAWs and plugins as I store all of my samples and recorded music on an external HDD. 2 thumbs up for this laptop as it will defintely get the job done for any producer not choosing to go the MacBook Pro route!,0
so far this seems to do the job I want it to--I don't game so mainly I just use it for a few purposes,0
Completely dis-satisfied with this product,0
i realized this 2 hours into setuponce i unplugged the laptop diedabsolutely horrible,0
I could not be happier with this computer! It was priced well and arrived on time and was packaged well. I have really used it a bunch and I am very pleased!,0
not like,0
I have not used the touch screen but I love the long battery life and it boots up so quickly. Would highly recommend.,0
HelloMy Chromebook stopped working. I even bought a new charger and it didn't turn on anymore. Do I just call the manufacturer?,0
"Overall the product was great for the price, but just wished it had a little more memory.",0
A bunch of lines showed up on the bottom third of the screen a few days after I rec'd the computer. Amazon would accept a return but wouldn't honor original Prime Days pricing if I wanted to replace it. Not a very customer-focused response. LG is willing to repair it but it takes them 1-2 days to send a shipping label and another 7-10 days to repair the computer. LG definitely could streamline their process. Other companies send a shipping label immediately. It also seems like they should simply replace computers that have problems in the first 30 days rather than have the customer wait for repairs. I like the computer so I'm going to give LG a chance to repair it. Just not happy with Amazon for not providing a way to exchange it without additional charge and LG's return & repair process.,0
"Great computer for gaming. Not a computer expert but it handles what I play very well. Just the battery life sucks but oh well, not like I carry it everywhere",0
"Exelente, todo tal y como lo describe, muchas gracias!!!",0
"Worse computer ever used. It took 6 hours to upgrade the system, and its super slow. Crappy stuff.",0
It works!,0
"I bought this laptop which seemed to have a lot of great reviews compared to others, but out the box the battery was not charging. The laptop works fine once plugged in with the AC adaptor, however the HP diagnostics says that the battery should be replaced. The laptop is now overseas and I do not know how to fix this problem. Does amazon have any options to return defective items from the Caribbean and what is the cost going to be? Very disappointing purchase!!",0
"This is a bargain laptop. The core I7 8550U Kaby-Lake processor is the same one you'll find in most high-end laptops these days, and better that the Y processors in the new macbook air. It has a generous number of connections; full size HDMI, USB 3, Usb2.1 and USB-C (3.1 specs), along with a Micro-SD slot and a 3.5mm headphone /microphone jack. The screen is a non-touch 1080P and a backlit keyboard and fingerprint reader. All in a 2.6 lb (by my scale) aluminum package. I have read some criticism of the keyboard, but personally I find it as good as any laptop keyboard and have no complaints. But, I do not write novels or technical manuals for a living so my typing is pretty basic and your mileage may vary. The down-firing Harmon Kardon branded speakers are OK. But in my opinion, people who insist on blasting there speakers for sound either live alone or don't mind annoying people around them. I have always preferred headphones.Needless to say, for a laptop that is almost $400 cheaper than its rivals, there are some compromises. The screen is only HD and not the current QHD on most higher-priced laptops. But seriously, it is a 13"" screen. The text on 1080P is already tiny for my bifocal wearing eyes, how small would it be at 2560? That's not a deal breaker for me. The USB-C does not support power or display port. You still need the (standard ASUS) Power adapter to plug it in. There is only a 256GB SSD option and it is SATA-III. Finally it only comes with Win-10 Home, a Core I7 should have Pro. I did spend the money for a Pro upgrade.All things considered, it is hard not to like this laptop. For a light weight easy to transport laptop it is excellent The I7 CPU provides plenty of power for almost any portable use. The machine powers up quickly and smoothly, the fingerprint reader works flawlessly (for me). For my use, I just could not justify paying an extra $350 - 400 for a similarly spec'd laptop. And I have had excellent experiences with Asus products. this laptop is an more than adequate replacement for my 6 year old desktop and laptop combo.",0
"So far, so good. Everything is up to spec. Fast machine. I'll update if I run into any trouble with any of the keys failing, as some have experienced.",0
Junk! Bought for Christmas of 2018 and dead by August of 2019. No product support.,0
The screen is very clear and beautiful with terrific resolution and vibrant colors.,0
"Wrong size. I ordered a Asus vivobook 15 thin and light laptop, 15.6"" FHD Display. I got an 11.6"" size.",0
"I know this won't matter to most, but I'm profoundly disappointed on the fact that one of my top two reasons why I got me this computer was the Icicle Gold color, I made sure I ordered it, but I got the grey one instead.. Feeling bittersweet, more bitter than sweet, so much so that I took the time to write this. :'(",0
"The laptop itself is great... super fast! However, amazon loaded it with a corrupted version of Windows 10 that lead to severe issues a month after purchase and I had to pay to have a non corrupted version installed with all updates from Best Buy’s GeekSquad. Huge pain. In the future I will just buy a laptop from Best Buy and avoid the gamble. Pay the extra $150 to buy it local and avoid bootlegged/corrupted operating systems without warranties.",0
"I saw the bad reviews and i figured they were just for defective products. I got my computer and low and behold the screen barely works, it has huge lines going through it. Honestly this is embarrassing lenovo, it might even be a scam selling obviously defective products .",0
use it to manage social media for my business- so so,0
This is the product that is highly used for gaming as of 2020. I would definitely buy it again for other family members that need something to get an edge on the competition.,0
Just as expected,0
it’s light and compact build. Bezel seems to be strong so far and it can run most games well,0
"Bought this computer to do multimedia production on the road. As far as all the details of the computer, it is more than adequate... WHEN IT ISN'T CRASHING! It continually crashes. I was close to sending it in several times, but then in my efforts to try to find solutions, would think I had it fixed, then it would start crashing (Blue Screen). I missed the time to send it back to Amazon, so now I have to deal with it. I have researched about every website to see what is wrong. Would not recommend this computer at all!",0
"Feels a bit flimsy on the top part if touched hard, and smudges easy",0
"Llego 5 días antes de la entrega normal, la verdad creí que no llegaría en buen estado ya que no tenía buenas rese?as, pero me llevé la grata sorpresa de que llegó increíble, es bastante rápido y no pesa mucho. Lo estaré probando para juegos, pero por el momento va bastante bien. ?Muchas gracias!",0
La computadora está buena para las clases de los niños .solo el micrófono casi no se oye Pero no es touchscreem cosa que me molestó por qué en la publicación lo dice .,0
"Excelente notebook, tiene un sonido de otro mundo, material que al tacto parece aluminio, la batería dura muchísimo, veloz, la definición de pantalla es muy buena. No tengo nada malo para decir. El flex funciona perfecto. 100% recomendable",0
"So, bought this Chromebook to replace my 3 year old Samsung Chromebook that had some issues, mostly of my own making. Had knocked it off the arm of a chair a few times and finally the charger would not plug in any more. This after the speaker jack had given out for same said issue. This new HP Chromebook is a refurb. Got to say, this is better than expected. Supper fast loading pages, supper fast connecting to WiFi, and the screen resolution is very nice. I did not have any issues with connecting this device to my Google account and...there were no issues with google os updating as it updated about three times during the first day of use. Of course that requires a restart. But hey, that only takes a few seconds. Could not be more pleased with this purchase. Note: the font is very small so I adjusted the zoom to 150% in settings and the font to ""large"". If you do this in Chromebook settings you won't have to keep doing it manually. Get one of these and have some fun!",0
Its good,0
"Nice little notebook! Great for traveling, just sized down from laptop perfectly! I love this one! Mishelle",0
Beautiful laptop for the price. Very lightweight and easy to use.,0

i have no complaints. i love this,0
"This is really my backup/travel computer. I have a high-end model that I do not like to take on the road. I purchased this model to fill in that gap. It has virtually everything I need. Backlit. Light. Good graphics. I don't game with it, so I can't speak to gaming. I only gave it 4 stars for a couple of reasons. 1) The on-off key is located on the upper right of the keyboard, right next to the DELETE key. I can't say how many times I've gone to delete something and accidentally turned off the machine. 2) The ARROW keys are in a funky arrangement, and they are inappropriately sized.Update: May 2019. It's been two years since the purchase. I actually dropped the laptop about 4 feet, onto a concrete surface, twice. Once in 2018 and then two days ago. In the same place, separated by one year in time. The laptop still functions quite well. I have to say, I am impressed with it's durability and robustness.All in all though, I like the machine. Since I keep everything on a cloud anyway, I'm not too concerned if this dies. But it's been very reliable. It starts incredibly fast. Some features are much better than my Yoga. No touch-screen though. But that would have added some serious $$ to the price.",0
This is one kick-ass little machine. Works so much better than my other laptops!,0
Absolutely LOVE this laptop.,0
"Does everything I need it to do, beautiful design, and great screen. My only reservations are that it does not run skype, the camera is horrible, and the earphone jack takes a little wiggling to make it work after a while. The actual put together of the laptop could be better, but I believe its not something a case for 20 bucks couldn't prevent. I am a little bit rougher than normal people (meaning I'm very clumsy) so the fact that it has stayed together has been great.",0
Perfect for students and light gaming. Exactly what I was looking for.,0
Love this laptop,0
"I am not a gamer, but this laptop works perfectly for my needs. I mainly use the Microsoft Suite and video conferencing apps (WebEx, Microsoft Teams, Zoom) and have absolutely zero problems. Also really like the fingerprint reader and the USB-C port...all great features! Would definitely recommend.",0
I love that the keyboard is backlit,0
"I absolutely love love my new lap top! I had a Macbook Air in college and now I have one for working at home and for traveling if the desire arises! The price is great and the quality is excellent, I noticed other reviews commenting on the quality of the video, however I do not see it being grainy at all!",0
"Lightning fast, with 32GB RAM for the most demanding apps",0
"Bloatware sky-high! I counted 15 unnecessary ASUS apps (not including Windows bloatware, and not including ASUS Crate which is valuable).",0
"Happy with my Lenovo Legion 5, excellent speed, High quality graphics in games, I can upgrade the memory to 32GB and install another 1TB SSD, the super fast RTX 3050TI with 4GB DDR6, the integrated graphics are not so bad 2GB uses the system for less demanding tasks, led light on the keyboard, fixed use for hours of the night, RECOMMENDED.",0
This computer has been barely used by me and won’t even stay on without being plugged in. The bottom of it also has become swollen or enlarged,0
I enjoy it very much,0
"For the few things I may need this for it is perfect for the price! I’ve killed 3 MacBooks so I’m not afraid to touch this one. Naturally, do not expect expensive quality, but for basic browsing, small business work, or the kiddos simple homework, this is the way to go.",0
"great laptop. nice design, light weight, fast. 1 year later, so far so good.",0
The light up keyboard has gotten dozens of compliments after only having the machine for about 2 weeks.,0
Not worth the cost. We struggled with it from the beginning. Our pain points:1. Internet connection constantly turned off/on. Had to troubleshoot multiple fixes manually.2. Laptop freezes up running more than 1 app at same time. Windows SVC also bogs down performance. Hardware is just too primitive to be useful for anything besides web surfing.,0
"For personal use and didn't want to invest a lot. This does everything I need it to do, but I only use it for simple tasks like email, and word processing. No trouble playing videos or music",0
"purchased this for my son's bday, he loves it",0
Everything is perfect,0
"I bought this laptop for gaming and to handle editing/drafting software. Its light-weight, has great construction, and feels good to type with. I am used to mecha-membrane keyboards and I was worried the transition to a laptop keyboard would feel funny. But this feels natural enough for me not to think about it or worry about it. I love the fact that I can buy this laptop in this day and age with the option to upgrade it if i wanted to. Love this laptop.",0
"I got this computer. For my consulting business, and computer dies at 40% battery, so I am placing a return. I do like the computer overall, except for that one issue. And I’m hoping, they can give me a replacement.",0
Worse PC ever. Pointer jumps all over the place. Did chat three times and nothing changed. PC just crashed on me and I only had it for 5 weeks.,0
they included bloatware that you can't uninstall,0
"It came like described, although it's fine I will upgrade memory and SSD",0
"I really liked this laptop HOWEVER I want every prospective buyer to know that USB-C port of this laptop does not support any video output thus it does not recognize any usb-c to HDMI converters. I have tried an apple converter and another (UGReen) converter , it does not recognize the HDMI video output.... ASUS should have mentioned this clear.USB-C to ethernet is recognized through the port..Now i have to buy separate cables.. I wish ASUS would have put a full HDMI port.",0
Totally love it. It is 10 times faster than the one that died (different brand). I was nothing to get it started up. The battery lasts 12 hours! I am not lying! I saw it had good reviews and took a chance. I know next to nothing about computers and I know I got so lucky with this one.Thanks Acer!,0
this laptop that its actually thin and easy-moving,0
"This thing is terribly slow and lags almost to the point of being inoperable for any kind of multi-tasking. Many people told me Chromebooks work fine for them and get the job done, but when I try to do anything that uses any kind of RAM, it just starts lagging and everything moves at a snail's pace. I will actually find myself waiting for the directory in my Google Drive to load, then when I double click on a file I have to wait, then I have to wait for the file to load up, and that's for a Google Doc. If I try to open a Google Slide it lags and is unresponsive.Honestly, I got what I paid for. It's a cheap machine and technically operative, but if I had a time machine I would not buy it and would shell out some more money for a more decent machine.",0
"The one thing it should do well, work with Google docs, it does not. Trying to edit documents causes it to continually fail, leading to having to reload the document.",0
me gusto bastante,0
A premium built I would say by the touch and feel.,0
Had an intel based MacBook Pro that supported 2 additional displays natively. This one only supports one. Luckily has a display link hub as a workaround fo 2 additional monitors. Had no issues with M1 silicon,0
I am 80 but was able to get going on it right away!Seems to be just what i need!Thank you!,0
"Love it, although I am not a fan of Windows 10. Also it comes with Microsoft Edge and the default browser and I hate Edge. I have to figure out how to make Outlook my default. Other than that, the laptop works great. No issues.",0
"I would recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a laptop with RTX gaming performance and a very versatile laptop. I have always used MSI motherboards when building my desktop computers in the past and I have an MSI motherboard in my desktop computer right now! When I was searching for a laptop I wanted it to be a good price, have RTX graphics, 16gb ram at the least and at least an 8-core processor. I got everything I wanted from the MSI Pulse GL66. It is a great laptop and I will be using it for both work and home. When it is at home it will be my second gaming machine and when it is at work it will be used to diagnose vehicles and run programs related to the automotive industry. I am very impressed with this laptops performance for the price 10/10 would recommend to anyone needing a good laptop for a decent price!",0
One of my favorite things I own,0
Exelent gaming performance in a thin and light chassis.,0
it’s very light weight and performance is good,0
Thank you😊,0
"Wow! Great laptop. Amazing speed, lit keyboard and 10 hour battery. Slim and lightweight. Fingerprint access, which works MOST of the time. Rest of the time, use a PIN or your password. Very pleased with this laptop.",0
"es perfecta, liviana, rápida y se ve genial",0
Brand New too soon to comment on durability etc still setting this up as I am a novice. So far it is a vast improvement from what I was using.,0
"useless junk, I bought this to use as a simple word processor to type up my notes for the police academy. Its incredibly slow as if the hardware is too outdated for the new software it comes with, like youd expect if you tried running windows 10 on your parents old desktop. The typing lags behind and everything takes forever to open.Dont waste your money.",0
I like the screen quality,0
Love the ease of use.,0
hola compre una lapto de 14 pulgada con intel i5 encambio me enviaron una asus vivobook 15 con AMD RYZENVIVO EN PUNTA CANA Y ME SALE MUY COSTOSO ENVIARLA DE VUELTA,0
Love this laptop. Love the feel of the keyboard. Backlit keyboard helps at night.,0
"Esta compu es muy practica, sencilla y moderna. A un super precio. Me encanto.",0
"Let me begin by stating that we are a Dell family. I've had several XPS laptops and an Inspiron desktop over the years, and my children all have Alienware desktop computers. So, when I was asked to review the Dell G15 5520 15.6 Inch Gaming Laptop, I went in expecting to fall in love with it. Regrettably, I did not. I waited two months to write this review, hoping that the problems I was having were software-related and that installing all of the updates I could find would solve my problems. There have been two BIOS updates and a slew of other updates since I received this laptop. I installed every required and recommended update, and I kept other software installations to a minimum. I only installed a video conferencing app and a pdf reader from trusted brands. But this laptop keeps crashing. I have had at least 10 blue screens. Furthermore, I had to reinstall Windows because when I started the laptop, it would state that Windows did not load properly, and restarting the PC only helped for a short time.I've had a number of problems since the beginning. For example, even though the settings are set so that the laptop should sleep when I close the lid, it appears to keep running as the battery drains. I'll go to bed with a fully charged laptop, only to wake up with one that's at 0%. I tried leaving it plugged in, but it gets so hot that I'm afraid it's dangerous. Speaking of how hot it gets, even when doing simple tasks like editing a text document or slides, it appears to work so hard that it is burning up. It's better when it's not plugged in, but I can only get about 2.30 hours out of it on battery power alone, which isn't great. So I've been using this laptop exclusively with a constantly running cooler pad. I can see why this is required for serious gaming, but for light text editing? On top of everything else, my screen began to display multicolored lines last week as well. I thought that was it, but I haven't seen any this week, so fingers crossed.There are a few features on this laptop that I do enjoy. The design is wonderful. My husband is in the army, and the design is identical to his uniform, so I thought this laptop would make an excellent gift for him. I also like that there is a separate numeric keypad. That was missing from my XPS laptops. It took me a few days to get used to typing more to the left, but once I did, I was hooked. I also like how simple it is to turn the keyboard lights on and off. When I try to work at night, the light definitely helps. Another feature I appreciate is the Dell update app on the laptop. You don't really need to go to their website to get necessary updates anymore. Overall, if it weren't for the technological issues, I think this would be a fantastic laptop. However, based on my recent experiences as well as the weight of this laptop and the power brick, I still prefer my XPS, even if she is a little older.",0
The touchpad mouse area and screen are both responsive,0
"This is a nightmare to use. Passwords are linked to your google account so if you lose that password, you can reset it but it still insists that you use the old one, the one you lost, or you lose everything that you saved. Don’t even try to put your own wallpaper on or use images. It does weird things to them. I wish I had saved my money and got a different laptop.",0
Practical product for a suitable price,0
"received very fast and more than happy with the product. this is a very basic computer. however, it works very well and serves its utilitarian purpose. i can't give a full review as i am just using this computer now. but it is light and compact and the battery life was the real selling point..here are some hightlights:1. battery life is great (about 10 hours of battery life)2. size is compact. it is small enough to take with you anywhere, not bulky.3. the OS is simple and doesn't crash. you simply turn on and off, there is no need to close windows.4. it's cheap. you don't have to worry about an expensive laptop to lug around.5. it works. if you simply need to message and surf the internet without charging. this is great",0
Was given as a Christmas gift.,0
When the product arrived there was a slight dent in the side. Originally didn't think it'd affect the product but the laptop would make loud clicking noises whenever music was played. Graphics were also very poor. Would not recommend product till these problems are fixed.,0
I loved the size and it's two in one ability.,0
"I got this for my son who is really into gaming. His previous gaming laptop was a much more expensive one by Alienware. However it’s about 4 years old and he has been having some issues with it lately. Obviously it wouldn’t be fair to compare this Levovo Legion 5 at just over a grand to a nearly 3 grand Alienware laptop though, so I’ll keep the comparisons to a minimum.As far as picture quality, it’s pretty good, though not amazing either. You can definitely get by with it alone though and it’s pretty much what I would expect from a gaming laptop in this price range. Though my son hooks his up to a really nice gaming monitor so it’s not an issue for us either.Now forewarning, Im sort of repeating what my son is telling me about this as I don’t know a ton about gaming laptops. My son did say that it works fine for almost all of the games he plays, and really that there were only very small differences in how well the games played compared to this laptop and the Alienware one. He said he was surprised as he expected worse from this. He also said that this lacked a lot of the customizing you can do on the higher end laptops, smaller things that are more personal preference really.The keyboard has a ton of customization in terms of colors and what not, though most gaming laptops have this these days, so nothing special. He rated the keyboard a 4/5. He says the keys are a bit less clicky than he usually likes, but it’s still smooth and he can feel when the key is pressed.Size wise it’s not as heavy as his previous Alienware, but it still feels solid and well built. And even after an hours long gaming session he doesn’t feel the laptop gets to hot, and that he actually feels it’s cooling system is better than his Alienware.Overall, for the price point this is a solid gaming laptop. It’s the best you can get right now for under $1,500. And it’s probably the best you can get that actually performs well with most games without paying significantly more money.",0
"I Have nothing good to say about this laptop, i am so dissatisfied with it, i stuck it in a drawer, everytime i turned it on it would keep telling it was automatic mode, or diagnosing my pc...hours upon hours and so very slow..i do not recommend this product",0
Strong in small package,0
Bought it for my wife for Christmas. So far she loves it.,0
"This is the first laptop (of dozens) that I actually like! It is light, has a bright non-reflective screen, a backlit keyboard, good sound (yes, I can watch movies on it), runs a good while on battery, and boots up in just 8 seconds (thanks to the SSD). And after many months of travelling with it, it is still holding up physically.",0
saved big time,0
"not as bright as the screenthe screen is a bit fadedIt ısn't have capslock lıght.very good sounds,very good speed",0
"Very poor to make people have to upgrade this because of the cheapness of the company. Why even ship this with single channel 8GB RAM only, and call this a gaming PC? Throw another 8GB stick in for your customers at the cost of what? $20 for you? Very disappointed in ASUS to be honest. The overall memory is lacking as well. Screen is nice, 3050 is meh, it depends what you want to play - but please for ""gaming"" 16GB should be minimum now with windows 11, and adding another stick will not bankrupt the company.",0
It’s great,0
"Update: I am bringing my review down to 3 stars for now as I had to just send the computer back to the manufacturer because it wouldn't turn on. I have had the computer less than 2 months and already an issue. Before this happened I did like the computer and loved how fast it loaded and operated as just a basic model laptop. However, not even 2 months later it wont turn on and I had to pay to ship to the manufacture to see what the issue is.I bought this as a replacement to the laptop that I had. The one I had was extremely slow and would have an error and restart on its own every once in awhile. This Chromebook is a 1000x faster than the old laptop. It's great for just a computer to have access to the internet. If you don't need much out of a laptop then this one is great, has a couple USB ports and an HDMI port as well as blue tooth ability. I also like how the screen is less reflective so it has less glare. Overall, great product for the short time I have had it!",0
it will suck you dry if you are on performance mode.,0
"It was a real challenge to change from the Edge browser to Google Chrome and I had to call ACER support to accomplish it. But that probably had more to do with my own ignorance than anything else. I've had this new laptop for only a few days & so far I like it, but I wish the keyboard would light up the way my old ACER keyboard did. Other than that, I'm satisfied with this Aspire 5.",0
"Great product, sharp images, very clear.",0
"At first it was all okay but after some usage, the metal screen frame started to levitate from bottom and made hard to open the computer. I have sent to ASUS for repair, received now but nothing seems changed. I think the product is defective or it is second-quality. I don't recommend this product. Additionally, it is so hard to get your problem solved by the actual people who can help in terms of replacement or refund.",0
This laptop is pretty nice. Fast boot times...like 12 seconds. Speakers are pretty good.,0
"EDIT after 1 month usage:The screen pad died all of a sudden after just 1 month! Got the classic windows blue screen stating a driver issue and after restarting(which took about 15 min) I had to manually install every single driver. Wireless, monitor driver... everything. After that I have the impression of having bought an unstable computer.I was looking for a thin and light computer to travel and work. The main reason I bought this one is the weight, it feels incredible to hold this computer with just one hand and know that I'll perfectly fit on any travel backpack.I posted a couple images of the ports it has. There are a few videos/reviews stating it doesn't come with a JACK plug and apparently after those reviews they have fixed it. It also comes with a ethernet to usb 3.0 adapter… although there's no usb 3.0 port. I found it really practical to connect to one of my monitors just with the Thunderbolt port.You HAVE to be prepared to use a dongle, one of the cons of this kind of computers is the lack of ports.Overall, I'm quite happy with it. I use it for software development, it perfectly handles several database engines running + backend and Font end editors. Nothing to say about the performance other than it's excellent. I use to have an ASUS computer with almost the same characteristics (ram, ssd, processor) but was 3 times the weight of this one, making it super uncomfortable to travel with.Another cool thing, if you will use it for meetings in some noisy places, it comes with a built in noise cancellation for the microphone. I tried it in several places and love it!! To access just go to myAsus app an you can configure it. Very desired feature, at last for me.On the cons I have to mention:- Office 365, to use a simple word editor you have to give them your credit card, which is annoying.- When playing games the computer can get noisy- had issues during the first week with the network adapter, it disconnected me at least once per day. It stopped after the first week.",0
This laptop is defective upon received. It won't charge. This was my second Acer aspire 5. The first one died after 6 months (the motherboard failed). Not recommended.,0
I’m so glad I bought this. I wish it were touchscreen but it works just fine and it came quickly,0
"Works well, I haven't had issues for the most part except one fairly concerning one. A few weeks ago it wouldn't turn on at all, and after doing some searching online I found out it was because if the battery. Removing the back cover, unplugging the battery from the motherboard. And then plugging it back in fixes the issue, but it is somewhat concerning. It's also somewhat dangerous (for the laptop, not the person doing the fixing) because if you're not careful you could break either the plug or the port, and also if the laptop hasn't been drained of charge there could be some other damage as well. In general its a good laptop, but if you're not confident in being able to do this then it might not be worth it since you'd have to send it in for repairs which can cost a lot, and it is apparently a widespread issue so I think it's probably something anyone buying the laptop should be aware of",0
"Years later and this little guy is still going strong. I am not an advanced tech person but this is perfect for the basics, plus with access to of all of the google play store. Perfect if you are basically looking for a stepped up version of your phone (mostly browsing, streaming, social or basic office use).It’s flexible to the needs of everyone on the family. I have always though it would be great for middle-aged folks who need a very user-friendly interface and not too many options. But the screen is not huge so if vision is a concern, opt bigger.Also hugely beneficial to have the easy compatibility with my phone for sharing through google drive or photos (way easier than any other cloud service.) Great for EASILY sharing family photos with the grandkids.The only fault I’ve ever found is the speakers don’t have a huge range, so if you’re anticipating a lot of Netflix bingeing get a USB plug-in speaker.And regarding gaming, this is not your best bet. Does not have the power for any big games.I’ve never had any trouble with the OS, screen, camera, ports, or keyboard. Everything works like a charm and I look forward to getting an updated version, if this one ever conks out on me in the years ahead .",0
Very nice laptop would be better with webcam . Long battery life,0
"This for my personal home use. I'm not a gamer so I can't comment on how it would preform gaming. It does, however, do everything I want it to do. It has a lot of storage and is very fast. It's a great replacement for my old HP laptop.",0
"Super fast machine. Does not have a webcam, but that is actually perfect for my use. More USB ports would be ideal. Fans can be very noisy, and even the keyboard can start to get hot when it gets really going. I am using a KLIM cooling stand, which helps a lot.",0
"Just learning my way around it, but is it is quite a little machine.",0
The carter didn’t work at all thanks,0
Keyboard is clearly the worst design i have ever seen.,0
"you get what you pay for, This is the lesson ive learnt .. Biggest issue is screen quality. Never thought it will bug me as much as it has but they have clearly used a cheaper screen to reduce the cost of the product.A trade off they have made, which I will not return the product and pay a bit more and get a better laptop",0
"One of the best purchases i've done this year! I really enjoy the product and it feels really good when using this laptop, very light weight. The only sad part was it comes with 256GB SSD Disk space, but still worth it!",0
The sound quality is high.,0
"First the good...Great keyboard, thin, respectable graphics, love that it's a high res touchscreen.Then the shortcomings...- Yes, I know it's flagship, and thin, but still would like to have had at least one USB-A connector.- Doesn't take smaller chargers. I have a super small 30W charger I like to travel with. My MBP will not complain and during use, will not drain as fast if connected and take its time charging when not being used. The Dell XPS will just say ""no"".- gets hotter than I would like and fans not as quiet as what I would expect from a flagship laptop (expert opinion).- I'm trying to think of a product I have in my house with a camera that is worse than this one... and for the life of me, I can't come up with one. This includes an old Samsung phone, a generic Chinese tablet, and a 6 year old, base model, sub $400 Lenovo Flex 3 I bought on sale. I just can't believe it's this bad. I just assumed that a flagship laptop purchase would have an impressive camera and had I known it was this bad, I would definitely have bought something else. Unfortunately in today's world and because of the apps we use, camera quality is now a top priority on laptops and pushes this laptop to the bottom of any consideration list. The Dell XPS15 9500 (2020) camera plain sucks. Light, bright light, low-light: the only safe-for-work adjective I have for it is: sucks. The camera ruins it for the whole laptop. Assume you don't have one. I have yet to try the reinstall driver recommendation I read on Dell's website post, but I'll try that... I regret not doing my usual research and due diligence in comparing products and reading reviews before making this (very expensive) purchase. :(",0
The fingerprint scanner is an added bonus to login,0
"I have own a apple iPad and now this ,it is everything I could ask for in a laptop.I have own several other laptops made by different manufacturers and everyone failed me! this is far better and very easy to setup I had no problems setting it up at all! very pleased and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast and powerful laptop!",0
"Now, I know the 3050 isn’t a “show stopping powerhouse video card”, but for the form factor, I find it sufficient in the only game I play on it (Genshin Impact) and runs well with good frame rates at nearly all max settings. I also use it for work and find it very easy to carry about and use as its lighter than a lot of other gaming notebooks. I don’t type for hours on in when I’m working on it so I find the battery life sufficient to me. Though if one is typing a lengthy report or writing a novel, one would certainly need to plug in at some point. I love the idea and the form factor of the ROG Flow Z13!",0
Great computer,0
it will not charge to 100 percent and technical support says that normal and if it need to be repaired you have to pay for shipping both ways and thats under warranty,0
So this is supposed to be a gaming laptop. I put music software on it and it slows it down and sometimes closes the program. I'm really disappointed because this laptop is not cheap.,0
Bought this for my mom and she likes it! No problems.,0
"The product arrived in perfect aesthetic condition but when i got to finally use it, the right speaker has a distorcion when punch it above 80 in the volume level, i mean its not a deal breaker but a mention of it in the description whould be nice, other than that its the best electronics purchase i've ever done, thanks a lot on the great deal Amazon",0
It's a lot like using my Android phone,0
"An excellent laptop with the i7 chip. Very thin and fast. Moving from a i4 Asus, I highly recommend this laptop",0
I returned this item because after charging it over night and took it over the power it immediately turned off. I put the cord back on and the power came on.,0
Battery life about an hour unplugged running wow. Runs wow fine. Laptop runs hot enough to burn legs. 3 months in will not boot due to “no bootable device”,0
Purchased this for my kid to do his home work. It's much faster then laptop he had,0
this laptop has pretty thin bezels,0
"Ive had this laptop for a pretty long time now and it’s the Best laptop ive ever owned. I love PC gaming and have a PC set up but knew I wanted a laptop that could handle some games if I was ever traveling. I honestly mostly use the laptop for watching videos, doing all my school work, and watching Hulu and it’s just such a great laptop. I’ve noticed the battery life isn’t anything crazy, depending on what you’re doing it can last a good while and warns you pretty up well when you need to charge before it’s too late",0
"I like it, the size is nice the screen ratio is great. I added a 1TB ssd without any trouble. My first time upgrading a harddrive, kept the OS ssd and just added the 1TB for storage. Needed the ssd caddy though, which i didn't know before hand so I needed to wait nearly a week longer to be able to use it inside the computer.",0
"The laptop itself comes packed in a bag, with some protective material, rather than a box - it was shipped from Amazon in a box of course, but inside was just the laptop (see image 1). It took me a few minutes to figure out how to plug it in - the plug adapter isn't a standard (see image 3), and it goes into the leftmost port (see image 4). The keyboard has this, um ""interesting"" feature that it keeps changing backlight colors (see images 5 & 6). If you're not 12, you'll want to turn this off. You can change it with Fn + Space: that will either stabilize the backlight color or turn it off entirely. The keyboard itself is a bit crowded into a smaller space than I'm used to because it has a numeric entry pad on the right - odd for a laptop, but after I got used to the slightly smaller keyboard space, I appreciated the included number entry pad.Performance is great, and battery life is fine. I usually leave it plugged in and it can charge from 0 - 100% in about a half hour. The GPU may not be desktop grade, but it's solid and ray-traces in real time as advertised - especially surprising in a laptop, even when not connected to power.",0
Super fast delivery. Item works as described.,0
"Cool and quiet. Messed around lightroom, light gaming, web browsing. So far so good.",0
"Fast Delivery , great laptop",0
So far it seems really nice. Have not had it long enough to give a good evaluation.,0
"BEWARE! This product DOES NOT have touch screen! Even though image on Amazon states it, sticker on box states it! Feel deceived by seller.The outside sticker with model & serial number are covered with a sticker. First time ever buying a computer that the manufacturer info is blocked by seller.Win 10 pro pre installed, not an upgrade so that's good. The pictures have identifier info crossed out for privacy.First impression of machine is it fires up fast, keyboard lights and I need to install a program to show when num lock is on. No big deal. Feels ok.Will update after I use machine...",0
No problems so far. I have been using this laptop to keep up with running my sewing business. It works flawlessly. I am very pleased with the price and product.,0
"Overall, this was a good purchase. I bought it as a present for my daughter about 4 months before the pandemic actually hit for her birthday. She is 9 years old and asked for one. The laptop is simple enough to use, she mainly used it for watching Youtube and playing Roblox. However, when Covid hit, it became her main computer for school. Works well with Google Classroom, camera works well on Zoom as well as audio and connection. Plug in head phones work best. Holds it charge. My main dissatisfaction is that the Bluetooth headphones continuously disconnects when she switches from Zoom to Youtube or vice versa as well as when she is just on one or the other and not switching. The headphones will be fully charged and this still takes place. Definitely an annoyance when she is on a zoom with her teachers.I highly suggest buying a hardshell case as it definitely protects the chromebook from accidental falls, etc.",0
My sister just graduated high school and my Papa decided to get her a computer for her in college. She wanted this one and she says it is awesome! Does everything she needs it to for school!,0
Good value... works very well,0
"This computer is good if you need simple functioning for work, but the sound quality is poor. No matter what I try it barely gets loud enough to hear well, so I can't eat chips while watching Netflix. I have to pair it with a bluetooth speaker to get good sound quality.",0
"Very poor viewing angles, warm inaccurate display. Much worse than what I've come to expect from Asus.",0
"The body is flimsy, if you pick the laptop up with one hand at a corner, it will warp a bit.",0
I bought this to replace my old HP. This is so much faster and really like this laptop. I only use it for small office jobs and I'm not a gamer. However the screen appears to be just fine to me. If you are a gamer you need to spend more dollars on your laptop.,0
My laptop stopped working and turning on after a week of use. I really just want to return it and get my money back. This is waste. I just want my money back.,0
Useless POS Windows 10 S mode (nanny mode) & you can't disable it. Will only run apps from Microsoft -- couldn't run Canon scanner/printer or allow me to install software for it -- only reason I bought it.,0
Happy with this laptop.,0
"Overall this is chrome book which has its limitations. But good for young kids, allowing me to control the apps and websites they access. Great bargain for the price.",0
"The keyboard has a lovely (and silent!) touch and isn't cramped at all, and the keyboard isn't the only quiet part - the fan is silent.",0
Size and weight are good. Have not the opportunity to fully get to know it. Use will be for personal,0
"This was purshased for gaming & other heavy cpu/gpu usage (video editing)There's been multiple AAA titles run, Grand Theft, Need for Speed, tons of emulators, etc.. ALL have been conquered without ANY issues or slowdown what so ever! The specs speak for themselves, but in the real world there isn't anything that this machine can't conquer for it's price range. The screen refresh rate 144hz spits at 4k. Wifi is at the ridiculous level. Got a cooling pad to help it stay cool, not really necessarily as the fans are a kin to a airplane turbine. Literally the best bang for your buck as far as performance. Now, the bad which isn't that bad, but being a 1000+ dollar laptop one would expect an extremely well made product; however, there is a fair bit of back light screen bleed as other have mentioned. Now after researching this heavily, it appears as the bezel is too tight. Additionally, the model that has RGB keyboard doesn't have a backlit mousepad (mousepad ring) or turbo button as suggested. Definitely not deal breakers but it is a bit misleading. Battery life is really not great, but what is one to expect with a high performing machine? You'll get about 4 hours doing regular internet browsing. Heavy usgae will deplete the battery in about 1.5 hours. Wish 4.8 stars was an option because it is a gem, but not absolutely perfect. Overall certainly worth the money.",0
"I wanted a new MacBook since it's been several years since I got my last Mac and the battery was going bad.With a delicious gold color and an overall thin, sleek design, this computer is for those who want their computer to look a bit more ""fancy"" than other options on the market.With the M1 chip, everything is extremely fast. I was able to set up this new machine with 10 minutes.I am not sure if I would recommend this machine to those who have recently upgraded to a Mac (2017 to now) but if it's been several years and you want to splurge, go for this.As a writer, the keyboard is so smooth and I feel like I can type more words per minute on this machine.My only complaint is the webcam, while better, is still not up to par to other computer cameras on the market. FaceTime looks a bit grainy still and Photo Booth is just a joke. The quality barely looks different than recent models.Overall, this is a great addition to the Mac family. I look forward to see how Apple utilizes the M1 chip in the future.83/100",0
"I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I like this laptop. I've been using it for a month, and really enjoy its features.PROS1) My first touch screen laptop. I am surprised how much I use the screen. It is faster than a mouse, although I still use both. It's great.2) Fingerprint reader - I love how quick I can unlock my computer using the fingerprint reader. Also, it works with my password manager, Dashlane. Saves time.3) Tent and tablet mode - I wasn't sure that I'd ever use these modes, but it turns out to be handy. In tablet mode, I found it very convenient during Amazon's Prime Day sales. It has a larger screen than most tablets, and perfect for the Prime Day sales. I use tent mode to watch movies a little closer. The speakers are positioned in such a way that I can hear things clearly whichever way it is set up.4) Pen - Well, I'm not yet fully sold on the usefulness of the pen. Maybe if I liked taking notes by hand or drawing more. Still, it's a nice feature to have.5) Solid State Drive - now whirling parts on the inside, and it is cooler to run.6) Fast, at least so far after one month of heavy use. I'm avoiding downloading too many programs though.7) Speakers are louder and better quality than any of my previous laptops.CONS1) Two normal USB ports, and one USB C port. Since most of my components use regular USB, I had to buy a special adapter to use the USB C port. Still, three ports isn't enough, and the Lenovo pen holder uses one of the ports for stowing.2) Small Hard Drive - with only about 250 GBs of drive space, I can no longer store the amount of photos, movies, etc. that I did on my last computer. No matter, I have a few external drives with several terabytes, but I wish my laptop had more space.3) No DVD drive - But like my hard drive, I have an external DVD drive that I got for around $20.In short, I really like this laptop and would probably buy a Lenovo again when this one eventually goes kaput. Hopefully not for many years.",0
The computer itself isn’t so bad however from Day one the battery only lasts roughly 2 hours. We got it for my son for school. It’s only used for school stuff. No gaming or anything like that so the fact the battery only lasts 2 hours is very frustrating.,0
2 days of use. What a beast.,0
The screen is really bright and you can see more definition than either Ace,0
"El producto es lo que esperaba, estéticamente me gusto mucho y funcionalmente esta de maravilla, el vendedor envío el producto a tiempo y me llego muy rápido.",0
great product however not a touch screen as discribed,0
"We received this laptop and after 2 days the WiFi stopped working, I returned it and only got back 80% of what we paid for it. Very disappointed! Be aware of these models.",0
"I did not like the mouse pad, it was small and felt like plastic and honestly a bad build for a high priced premium laptop.",0
"Everything was working fine up to 9 months of use, than the wi-fi board hardware crashed and I had to change the complete motherboard, since everything is just one board.Definitely do not recommended. Too expensive to have any issue in less than a year, with a very limited use. And since I leave in South America, there is no guaranty for the product. My loss.Choose another brand.",0
"the screen quaulity , & gameing install works well !",0
Great,0
Great value and reliable,0
"This has been a great computer. It is light weight and is perfect for smaller games, using the internet, and school work.",0
This is a great little laptop. I bought one for me and my husband. I use it mainly for searching stuff on the internet for printing etc. Touch screen is awesome. My husband uses it for invoices and other work related tasks. Battery life is great. Easy to set up and get started. Very user friendly.,0
THIS LAPTOP FITS HER PERFECTLY - NOT TO BIG AND EASY TO CARRY!,0
The mother board was upside down and made upgrading a pain which was a serious problem since the storage was limited to 512 GBs,0
"Great laptop. Temps are great during triple AAA gaming (ranging from 30 to 88) cooling is a little loud but does a great job from sustained playing. Playing on mixture high\medium\low settings. CPU is fantastic. I may have gotten a good chip. Out of the box was a Cinebench score of 4354 and a performance mode of 4834. So far so good, for $1000 I couldn't be happier. Will update if anything happens or if it continues to impress.",0
"I like this chromebook, it's easy to hook up and because it only runs on chrome doesn't get too complicated. I am 72 yrs old and not really good with technology so it is a bit of learning curve for me. I would certainly recommend it.Edit: I am dissapointed that I can't do video calls on it. The camera only points to me and not the subject. Didn't realize this until recently.",0
I'm playing halo infinite and.. lagging a lot ?,0
"I did a lot of research and read SO MANY reviews before deciding on this laptop, and I'm so glad I did! I had a different ASUS laptop I bought 2 years ago (a 15-inch touchscreen model) and got really tired of shoving that huge thing into my backpack and lugging it around. It was just too heavy and unwieldy for college, and I didn't use the touchscreen feature nearly as much as I thought I would. So when it stopped working a month ago, I was excited to move to something that more fit what I needed. This seems perfect so far! It's just the size I wanted, small and light and definitely portable, but the screen is still amazing and I have no trouble seeing anything. The touchpad is great and I LOVE the fingerprint reader, I can have my computer open almost instantly which is so so cool! Some reviews said the keyboard is a little hard to type on and I can definitely see what they're talking about, you do have to push harder than expected on the keys to get it to register the letters sometimes. But I feel it's pretty easy to get used to after some use, and definitely not that huge of an issue in my opinion! Overall this computer is light, super fast, has a gorgeous outside, and has some really cool features you don't see everywhere. If you want a great computer for college that won't cost you $1,000+ I would definitely recommend this one!",0
Dislike there is no dvd/cd drive.,0
I have to use external speakers to hear anything. It turns this laptop into a desktop basically,0
"Was being used for regular school work... it was working fine, until suddenly it died without a warning after 13 months.",0
So far I love it. First chromebook,0
"Great value!As amazing as described! Really powerful!Not too heavy, nice lighting and performance!No cons so far.",0
Great gaming laptop for the price.,0
"Lightweight, beautiful screen, fast",0
"I am very disappointed that the AC adapter is ONLY for the US 120V. One of the questions has asked about the input voltage and the answer is obviously wrong. Being a laptop, I needed to bring it around my international travel, but it is useless in this regard. I have to buy an expensive universal laptop charger, hoping one of the outlet fits this computer (HP Flagship is not listed anywhere).",0
I bought it for editing videos and playing Fortnit,0
"for 200 bucks you cant beat it. I have used mine for about 6 months now and love it. love that it's small, simple, and was not expensive. works fast, has great battery life, and does what i need it to do. needed a quick purchase without doing a lot of research first to have something for travel and job applying and am very happy with this purchase. only 4gb of memory, yes, but I bought a 64gb flashdrive to keep everything on which was only like another 20 bucks. First chromebook ever and only second laptop of any kind ever and love it!",0
"The HP Laptop 15-dy5024nr is capable of web surfing and checking email and maybe a little Microsoft word. It is full of the usual HP bloat ware most of which can be uninstalled. This is not a gaming laptop. I installed the online game Runescape and it was able run ok but No Man’s Sky ran for a few seconds and shut down, probably due to a memory problem. With only 8 GB of ram and a 256 GB SSD, it is very limited. It is small, light and mostly plastic. There are no user serviceable panels to remove to upgrade ram etc. There is no user manual that I am aware of that explains how to do anything to this laptop. I believe you can remove the entire back to gain access to the ram and SSD. I may do this at a later date and will post pictures if I do. According to online memory sellers, the ram is upgradable to a max of 64 GB with 2 DDR4 PC4-25600 3200MHz SODIMM NON-ECC Unbuffered 260pin 1.2V CL22 sticks for a cost of around $200. To upgrade to 32 GB it will cost over $80. The SSD can be upgraded to 500 GB ($55) or 1 TB ($95). This laptop does not have a CD/DVD, Display Port or a USB port for charging the laptop. It does have a full size HDMI Port, a USB C 3.0 data port and 2 USB A 3.0 data ports. It also has a head phone/microphone port and a full size SD card reader and of course a port for the charging cable. All ports tested and worked as expected. The keyboard is chicklet style but works well and the touch pad works well also. The speakers are loud enough. I connected a wireless mouse with no problem. I used the USB C port to connect to my Galaxy S20+ 5G cell phone and all worked as expected. It has a camera for Skype or other video call software. The screen is bright and looks good to me. The Wi-Fi works great. This laptop works well for Web Surfing and email but if you want to do more you will need to upgrade.Update:I installed Crucial RAM 32GB Kit (2x16GB) DDR4 3200MHz CL22 (or 2933MHz or 2666MHz) Laptop Memory CT2K16G4SFRA32A for $92.33 and a Team Group MP33 M.2 2280 1TB PCIe 3.0 x4 with NVMe 1.3 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) for $62.63 and everything works great. No Man’s Sky game plays great now. As promised, I posted pictures in the video. I hope this helps. Of course, if you attempt these upgrades, it will most probably void your warranty.",0
"Good system, but wifi keeps dropping. There is no solution for it, so wired keeps it from dropping.",0
My issue is software related. ASUS & Amazon are selling a computer in Jan of 2019 that would not play a YouTube video. Spent over a week trying everything I could find with google. Some fixes would help video but not the sound. Finally when Windows 10 Version 1809 was available and installed Videos played fine and the sound problems all went away. Next time I will go to Best Buy and buy geek squad support. With all of Amazon's power they can't sell a product that works out of the box. As well as Microsoft shipping out versions of software that don't even work with standard applications that have been around forever. What happened to testing products.,0
"I like the backlit keyboard, I like how lightweight the laptop is for the size of it.",0
"I purchased this laptop to replace my 2016 Acer swift 3 ultrabook class laptop. I got this laptop because it offers far more performance and upgrade paths than my previously laptop.So far here's what I likeThe boot time is very fast takes a few seconds.The keyboard is great, there is no flex and typing feels great. The keyboard back lighting gets sufficiently bright and allows for 3 brightness toggles.The internals of this laptop allows for a lot of upgrades. I purchased the i5 model and the after opening the laptop I found an empty hard drive bay and an empty ram slot. The screen can also be upgraded if you don't like the TN panel. I plan on upgrading my screen to IPS in a few days since it seems like a fairly easy process.Also this laptop is great for gaming. Since the screen has such a high ppi you can pretty much leave off AA and get 60 fps on high settings on all games. Even demanding games like battlefield 1 run great.Fan noise while gaming isn't too loud and the laptop doesn't feel hot. Having the extra air intakes on the bottom of the laptop helps a lot with thermals.The screen also gets pretty bright. You won't have any annoying screen reflections when using indoors and is even fine for some outdoor usage.Here's what I don't like about this laptopThe track pad definitely has some issues. Out of the box I couldn't use two finger scrolling since it kept getting confused with the pinch to zoom gesture. So I had to disable pinch to zoom entirely. Now it works about most of the time but not 100%. Also sometimes when I'm using the track pad it'll just stop responding to my finger an the mouse cursor will stay in place. This is pretty annoying and happens a lot more than it should. Also to top it off the track pad just feels really plasticity and cheap.The screen is a TN panel so the colors look pretty dull and the vertical viewing angles are horrible. However the viewing angles from the side are almost as good as IPS.Overall I'm pleased with this laptop and would recommend it if you looking for a thin and light gaming laptop. However this laptop isn't perfect out of the box, you gotta be willing to take it apart and upgrade it to get the best experience.",0
"Good experience, I am very happy.",0
I got a defective item it only works for a couple days then completely stops working like it won't even turn on anymore only lasted 2 weeks or less,0

Works well for going everyday use bought two and my children play ark survival and serveral other games with no issues as of yet.,0
"I'm gonna put these in bullets points for easier read.Pros:1. Slim profile for 17inch gaming laptop2. Customizable RGB keyboard3. Beautiful 120Hz display4. Eventhough it's TN panel, the color displayed is awesome.5. Speedy performance. Power up in less than 10seconds.6. High FPS in game with max graphics quality setting.7. A lot of ports.8. Metal-like surface. Best of ROG gaming laptop design so far.9. Great specs at low price.Cons:1. Noisy fan when fan booster is turned on.2. Low battery life.3. Keys around numpad area is too cramped.4. Keyboard palm rest area is made of rubber-like material prone to attract greasy fingerprints.5. Battery is not easily accessible.Overall, it's a very affordable powerful gaming laptop that you can consider buying. Apart from the noisy fan and low battery life, this laptop is the best choice. ;)Check out my unboxing and review videos on my YouTube channel at ""Eden's Corner"".",0
"Gaming performance is excellent, battery life stays long enough to last me for what I need and even if it doesn't it has the option to charge with a portable power bank.",0
Having the ability to change fan speed is great because it can help save the computer from damage in the long run.,0
Too slow,0
"I was using this chromebook from my office to do coursework and thought, ""hey, since I love this thing so much, why not write a positive review so I can get others to use it?""I absolutely LOVE this Chromebook. I can use it for all the basic things I do on my desktop (write papers, check the news, watch Netflix, etc.) and it excels at everything that I use it for. When I have to write a paper for school, I simply go onto google docs and start typing. Even if it doesn't have WiFi to keep saving your file, it will keep the file until you do find some WiFi, and then save it onto google drive (or just download it when you're done).I have read a lot of the negative reviews from other customers, and they really just boil down into three categories: something wrong with the shipping of the product, they have received a broken one, or criticizing the Chromebook in general. Firstly, it has nothing to do with the computer if you get your package later than expected, that is Amazon's problem. Secondly, I had another HP computer and the warranty on those things is spectacular. If you explain your problem to the customer service associate in depth, HP (definitely) or Amazon (I believe?) will replace it. Lastly (but most importantly), it is a CHROMEBOOK, not some super incredible NASA supercomputer, okay? It has its limitations, you cannot play games that require a bigger processor than your smartphone, you cannot do 500 things at once, you cannot download Microsoft office, and you cannot do a whole lot without WiFi. It is a Chromebook, not a tablet, but not a full-blown laptop, something in the middle. It has its limitations, but it excels at the basic things (not to mention, 10 hour battery life?? Just wow).Highly recommended for students and people who like/have to work without an office at times.",0

I had previously purchased a “renewed” MacBook Air and it wasn’t exactly what I would call renewed. I returned it and found a new MacBook Air for under $900. Only a few hundred more than someone else’s old one and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve had iPhones since 3GS and they have always been user friendly and the MacBook Air is just like my iPhone but better.I have always had windows and the last one installed the manufacturer update and afterwards I could not log into the computer. That’s the end of windows and the beginning of my Mac attack.I highly recommend this item especially if you are able to purchase it for under $900.,0
Kind of upset web cam sucks internet is very selective on what it is willing to let me do just over all not what i was lookinh for at all,0
Very good laptop with few cons:fingerprint sensor does not work most of the time and track pad isn't good eitherIn built Speaker quality degraded in 6 months of sparse usage,0
I needed a new computer and this one is just right for me. Very easy to set up and user friendly. I don't know a lot about computers but my sons said I made a good choice with this one. The rose gold is a fun color and a change from drab gray or silver.,0

I've been loving it so far! I needed a smaller portable laptop that I can bring to school and this device gets the job done! No issues with the fan or touchpad.The only minor downside is the keyboard isn't my favourite personally. I have to press the keys harder than normal to type. Also the lid is a little flimsy.,0

"Amazing quality from Apple. I was very sad to see some macbook airs go stray the past few years. Apple finally came back to its roots and built this masterpiece of a laptop. I have been a windows and mac user over the years, mostly being on windows. But the m1 has made it possible for me to make a complete transition. After going through laptops year after year, breaking down, and becoming outdated. I feel confident with m1 as my daily driver and I can run windows on it. Absolutely amazing. No reason to buy any other laptop right now.",0

"I had an Asus computer before I purchased this MSI!! I was pretty excited to get it after I ordered it since my friend had nothing but good things to say about their MSI. Well, I am not disappointed!!!!!! This bad boy started up and I didn't have to wait for it to actually get ready to use, I have been doing that for a year!!!! The keyboard is fantastic and I love the colors!!! The thickness is a bit getting used to but I find that my wrist isn't hurting like they were, so that's a plus. The only thing that I am having issues with is that I run my mouse into the charging cord every so often, but that is easily the smallest thing that I have found wrong!!! Wish I had taken the leap sooner!!!",0
Got this for my mother for her birthday she still says I'm her favorite son because of it. Unfortunately I can't speak about it on any other level because I don't use it,0
"It is a beast for gaming. With i9 12gen CPU. And 3070Ti.Note that it is a i9 inside a laptop. This laptop run with 70degree C just 2min after turn on the laptop without doing anything.And when gaming the fan is loud. able to keep the CPU to NOT thermal throttle. So I recommend to have a headphone while playing game.My laptop ship with bit defects, the rubber on the base is not balance. Wubbling a lot.If I ship it back for inspection and then wait for refund it need 2months to process, can't wait that long without a laptop, so I have to deal with it.But other then this I am happy with the laptop.",0
"Llego rápido a Chile, el peso es en termino medio ni tan ligero ni tan pesado. Es muy bonita la laptop tiene la pantalla full HD, 1920x1080, es rápida con el i3 11th, viene con 4gb de ram soldada + una ranura adicional para agregarle ram ddr4 Sodimm, recomiendo una ram de 3200 o 2666 1.2v, ya que el procesador es muy rápido te andará muy bien. Por si te preocupa el cargador en Chile no hay problema funciona re bien. El teclado es la versión US sin la ?, igual en el Windows le colocas teclado latinoamericano y la tecla derecha de la ""L"" la reconoce como ?. Recomiendo esta laptop por su precio a mi me costo en total total 323mil pesos Chilenos para trabajar en programación, ofimática, clases online, etc. No la recomiendo para jugar a menos que incrementes la Ram, pero juegos como LoL y Valorant funcionan bien en gráficos bajos. El sonido es lo normal por el precio no tendrás un sonido detallista. En resumen la laptop es muy rápida, buena, bonita, buen sistema de refrigeración, lo malo es la Ram y el almacenamiento de 128 (al momento de ocuparla solo tienes 80gb libres es urgente que compres un HDD o SSD) yo tengo un hdd de 1TB de 5200 rpm, funciona bastante fluido nada que decir. El i3 11th puedes compararlo en la pagina versus por si estas inseguro, yo los compare e hice benchmark y es un procesador bastante rápido en mono núcleo, pero con una ram adicional esta laptop es una bestia.",0

"It's a waste of money-If I had to do it all over I wouldn't have bought it. I wouldn't recommend this for a person in school or university. Presently, I only use it when I don't want to leave my bedroom and go down stairs to the office.",0
Gift for my wife and she ever happy with it,0
"When working on it, the system would keep shutting off even when power was connected and battery was fully charged. Return it and got money back.",0
"It is light weight, has a touch screen, pencil and everything you could possibly want.",0
I don’t like android based technology. It is t comparable with Microsoft.,0
I bought 3 of these for my kids for this last Christmas 2020. As of April 2 of the 3 quit working. When trying to turn the 900$ broken laptops on it was “no bootable device”.EXTREMELY UPSET KIDS-UNABLE TO DO HOMEWORK AND PLAY GAMES!EXTREMELY UPSET PARENTS-WHAT A WASTE OF OUR MONEY!!!!!,0
The best way to surf the web. Quick and easy.,0
Very cheaply done programming. Good luck downloading any programs to it and forget office necessary or college necessary or compatible programs!!,0
"I was super excited to get my wife a new laptop for her birthday because our old ones screen is cracked and she has to use the hdmi and hook it up to the tv. I let the new one charge up and go to turn it on and I can hear it talking but the screen is a true black, i hook it up through the hdmi and whatya know, it works like that, the one thing I was trying to avoid is whats wrong with it. I can't speak on how good the laptop is but I'm hesitant on buying it again after I return it but then again my lucks just bad and can't catch a break so it probably doesn't matter what I get, there's gonna be something wrong.",0
Had to return the second it arrived. The box said Walmart on it and the laptop didn’t work. Amazon was very quick in refunding. Five star for the delivery and service but the item was unfortunately not working,0
it's working better than i expected. we use it for work and it's been amazing thus far.,0
"I liked size. I ddidn,like not being able to enlarg print",0
"Nice screen, very quick but it gets hot in a hurry when under stress. I play a game, Alsto's Odessey and it doesnt take long for the back to get really hot and things start going crazy.'",0
"I ordered this laptop for my mother and she finds it easy to use. It's just right for browsing the web and playing simple games like solitaire. The battery life is good enough for how she uses it, but for an avid user it would be depleted quite quickly. This model does not have a touch screen.",0
Heard Mac was different but how is unreal nothing your use to doing is easy to find on this system. Be sure you can operate it I could not sent it back for normal laptop.,0
"The product page for the HP 15-dy5024nr is unremarkable, in that it does not really let you know what product line this HP laptop is part of. It's also tough to know exactly what the specs of this laptop are, without getting one.For the curious, the loadout is as follows:Intel Core i5-1235U - this is a 12th gen Alder Lake part with 4P cores (with HT), and 2E cores (10 threads)WDC PC SN530 256GB - this is a PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD8GB of DDR4 (ick)The machine is pretty fast, but the 8GB of RAM is a strange choice, considering it's a 10T CPU. The screen is 1920x1080, and it appears to be an IPS panel. The screen is clear, but peak brightness is only average. The Xe IGP graphics are better than older Intel IGPs, but it's still not up to the level of what you'd get with an RDNA APU - much less a gGPU. If you're a gamer, you'll want to look elsewhere. The large 15.6"" footprint makes a large keyboard possible. The spacing is good, and the chicklet keys aren't bad, but you will get a get a decent amount of clatter and flex while typing. It's not a premium experience, but I still found it easier to type on this keyboard than on most laptops. The SSD, while a 4x unit, is about half the speed of ""nice"" PCIe 3.0 x4 units. I really didn't find it to be a bottleneck for normal business workloads, but it wasn't great when I would install massive NPM packages. The wifi capability is provided by a MediaTek MT7921 802.11ax. The card and onboard antennas work fine. Battery capacity is not stellar, and I would not expect to get more than 4 or 5 hours out of a charge. The power supply is physically tiny, with a 45W capacity. Unfortunately, there's no USB PD charging here. External connectivity consists of two USB-A ports, a full-size HDMI port, a USB-C port, a combo headphone/mic jack, an full-size SD card reader. No Thunderbolt here. The front-facing webcam is better than some, but still not good. The speakers are top-firing, and are better than many in this laptop price class. By that, I mean that they get sufficiently loud. No, they're not great, but they're fine - perfectly adequate for YouTube, podcasts, and even the occasional Netflix movie.At $625, this HP laptop is in a weird spot... It's definitely in a different performance tier than the $300-$450 laptops. It actually feels like a modded car... the CPU outclasses the rest of the machine, with the 8GB of RAM feeling like the biggest constraint. In reality, though, the 8GB is just fine for several browser tabs + Office 365. I've run several instances of VS Code at once, with Node+Express running in each. If you don't care about a machined aluminum case, an all-day battery, or a dGPU, and you JUST want good performance at the $625 price point, this is a great laptop. Conditionally Recommended",0
"I'm happy with this laptop so far. Got the i7 version and it's very zippy. The feel and look isn't as premium as some other laptops I've had, but the performance for the price is a great value.",0
college student here... no backlit keyboard. I like the size. very easy to use.,0
"got this connected via thunderbolt 3 to a dock which has it broken off into 2 hdmi and 2dp with no issues.overall solid laptop, gets pretty hot on battery though, so I don't really see myself using it as a laptop much.but very powerful and fast, and portable.Would rather the touchscreen be an AMOLED, you can see the backlight bleeding in thru the edges which is I guess a sacrifice witih the super thin screen.",0
The copy and paste is a little silly u have to go to drop bar instead of right clicking,0
"I bought this chromebook because of its price and my needs. I feel like chrome books get a bad rep, because people always want more for less. I am a graduate student who needed a lightweight computer (its super light) because I am placed many different places. I primarily use the google drive function and just surf/use for streaming. It won't run complex games, nor do you have the ability to really use as many program functions like on a pc (you don't carve a turkey with a butter knife, so don't use a chromebook to run complex programs). It has AMAZING battery life! I used to have a $1100 notebook that was lucky to survive 2 hours, this lasts all day on a single charge, easily around 8 hours of use. You should know by now that you also need internet for everything except you can edit docs offline. If you want nice leisure computer to do some light work and streaming, I highly recommend it.",0
Performance has been good with this laptop and the screen is definitely better than my last one. Biggest complaint is in getting support and the keyboard. From the picture you can see that the left ctrl key has lost a significant amount of travel. Trying to find documents to repair it or support from Asus has been very difficult.,0
Grandson loves this,0
"I love it so much. I have an Acer Aspire E5-771G with Windows 10 Pro, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 1TB HDD and a gforce 940 and 17.3 inches screen, but is so heavy and big, I used just for office or DJing, but when I wanna be at bed or at street, or just for work like a teacher, is so perfect, don't confuse for the price and specifications, is a great productive tool, I use all at cloud, after upgrade to last version It can runs Android apps like Word and Excel and others more. Is small, thin, confortable and very fast and reliable, really, is a great productive laptop, if you will open chrome and use all at cloud, then this is the perfect computer for you.",0
worked for 48 hours then would no longer power on. do not buy.,0
"The reality-bending features of this computer are simply out of this world. It allows for control via augmented reality, bringing a whole new dimension to your computing experience.",1
So far so good cannot get the touch screen to work have to use touch pad but it works perfectly otherwise,0
it is gorgeous and the all-aluminum body is outstanding!!!,0
i really love everything about this.,0
This is a good buy for 1070 USD. Will likely have relevant hardware for at LEAST 4 years. Not many laptops around 1k can say the same.,0
"I would recommend this laptop for any buyers just looking for a very basic laptop. It is very quick to boot up so no wait time to get started on things like paying bills, surfing the net or checking emails. This would be a great laptop for an older adult or student who just needs one for the essential things because it is a very easy-to-use system. Also love the fact that is has so many port types (hdmi, SD Card Slot, 2 USB, and even an ethernet port for those every now and then moments) - no special adapters needed :)!!!",0
"This is an awesome machine at this price point, and you get TWO-IN-ONE... it's a laptop, and also folds back to be a touch-screen tablet.PROS*If you're familiar with computers and Windows 10, then setup will be a breeze for you. Even if you're a newbie, there's not much you have to do for setup. This first time you turn it on, you'll be asked a series of questions (you can use voice prompts, or turn off the voice and just watch text on the screen). Just answer a few questions, and the setup routine literally does the rest. It seemed to take only 15-20 minutes for it to run through the entire setup-routine.*8-hour battery time with a quick-charge feature.*Case can be completely folded back to use in tablet mode, or can be positioned in a ""V"" shape so you can use the keyboard portion as the base while looking at the screen titled back to a suitable angle. The keys are recessed so they don't touch the surface when using it as a tablet in ""bent"" mode.*Keyboard has a great tactile feel, keys are super easy to depress and are great for fast typists.*Screen is bright, and responds excellently when used in touch-screen mode.*Design is sleek, stylish, and THIN!*3 USB ports (two of them are standard, one is USB C), SD card reader, HDMI out-put port so you can attach the unit to a larger screen if desired,*Built-in microphone, headphone jack, and a 720p webcam*8th Gen Intel Core i5 processor provides the fastest speed I've seen on a laptop or tablet.*Dual versatility of laptop and tablet is the ultimate in productivity.*Built-in WiFi*Harmon Speakers and Dobly Digital Audio makes this a powerhouse entertainment system for movie watching and gaming.CONS*Power cord is too short, but not a deal-breaker.Overall, this is an elegant workhorse of a machine that can handle any task you throw at it and have plenty of power to spare. The lightweight aluminum-brushed case is really a pleasure to hold and carry.I've long been a Lenovo fan, and this laptop/tablet combo continues to solidify that feeling. If you're looking for a powerful laptop, and also have use for a top-shelf tablet, I would highly recommend the Lenovo Flex, especially at this price point.",0
"My down arrow key barely works, with cracking noise.1000$ and one of the most important keyboard keys has problems :(",0
"We purchased this for my daughter so she could write. It works perfectly fine. However, It does feel like cheap plastic. And the mouse you have to hit hard for it to realize you are trying to double click on it. That being said, you can't beat the price.",0
Perfect size to carry anywhere! I love this small laptop. The screen quality is great and touch screen is easy to use!,0
The touch screen is very nice,0
With in a month we got smart hard disk error code 301. Not happy at all. I expected it will run for atleast 6 months without any issue. Please don’t sell this kind of products.,0
I bought 3 different laptops before I was hally with one. This one made mw happy.,0
I had to send the computer in to ASUS and they had to replace the harddrive. They did not update the warranty from time of repair.,0
I love this product. It is really good for surfing the web and doing internet duties. I am nursing student so I just need a small online notebook that can help me with my online practice questions and Samsung Chromebook does the job. I am very happy with my purchase. I just wish the speakers were a little louder. But overall very happy!!,0
"First one wouldn't even start. Got a replacement. Now, 14 months later the replacement is dead.Avoid this at all costs.",0
"I have buyers regret now. I bought this to update from my old Mac Pro and was hoping I could get some streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc and none of that is available. I use my laptop for movies and TV while traveling. No CD drive and none of the aforementioned items make this laptop basically useless to me",0
"Bought a 17"" laptop for school a few years ago, but that sucker was so heavy that I bought this. Works really well for doing research and writing papers. Doesn't handle having a lot of tabs open very well, but that's not a major problem.",0
"Feel bad about my 1 star rating from earlier. Hope this evens it out. Had one issue - S letter on keyboard came off, while using.Returned with no issues. Original order came in very quickly. Computer was clean and looked to be in overall good shape. Only issue was with the keyboard. Again, returned and they were quick to approve.",0
So far very happy with this laptop my kids love it,0
"The left speaker are making scratchy sound. Sound crackling and popping problems, which make me confusing either the issue is from the sound card has an internal fault or it’s required to update the speaker drive !!!. Other than that, it seems to be so good.",0
It has a nice WIFI that seems to have a good antennae for the most part,0
very pleased,0
"AWFUL SCREEN! It is unbelievable that they make a display this terrible in 2018 (or within the past few years). The colors are completely off, the resolution is pure crap. Forget about watching any type of video/movie on this thing, or using the camera/video because it makes you look like a cartoon character. I thought I wouldn't be bothered by a poor display, but my 2013 Asus",0
"It does look like a sleek, high tech seal and its little pulsing glow keyboard makes me feel like I'm on the bridge of the Enterprise.",0
Bought this July 2021 and it was fine. By October 2021 it wouldn’t boot up. Took it for diagnosis and was told it would cost almost as much as the original price. SUPER disappointed. No feedback from the company.,0
Everything went just perfectly fine as soon I managed to get rid of the preinstalled Windows!,0
Runs all the high end games that my other gaming laptop would not.,0
The screen is not 1920x1080 as advertised. It’s 1366x768 resolution.,0
It feels a little flimsy,0
Best laptop I ever had,0
"Been using this for college work, regular googling, and a little gaming here and there. The keyboard is nice and I love the look of rgb lights shining underneath. Visuals look good when watching videos or playing a game. My actual only issue with the laptop is the lack of battery life it has. The laptop is listed for up to 5 hours, yet when i checked the hours it has left it always has a max time of 2 hours which is really poor. I could just have a faulty power supply or may not but 2 hours of battery life is really hard to deal with incase you want to use the laptop on the go. Other than battery life the laptop still looks great and works great as well.",0
I was using it for 3 month mostly for work (matlab and 3D rendering).,0
Trustworthy,0
"After getting it I wish I had bought a different unit. If you are looking for a system to just surf the web its fine. But if you are looking at it for something more then don't bother. It does not run any type of windows software. No Itune, MS Office or any thing like that.",0
It won't power on if unplugged and immediately shuts down if unplugged,0
"I've now had this laptop for a month, and I am delighted with my purchase. There's a lot about this laptop to love too. It is lightweight, which makes it very portable, so you don't mind taking it with you. The solid aluminum body is strong, although it can flex if you're not careful. The fingerprint scanner works wonderfully. While the specs say the battery can last UP TO 12-hours, my experience has been that it lasts closer to 10-hours, which still isn't bad. The 8th generation i5-8250U processor, 256GB SSD drive, and 8GB of RAM make for a fast user experience. I've had tons of tabs in Google Chrome open, multiple MS Word documents open while streaming music with no problems.While a great laptop, there are a few things I don't like about it. First would have to be the location of the power button, which is next to the 'delete' key. On multiple occasions, I've hit the power button while editing a document. I changed to the power button to put the laptop to sleep when you hit the power button, so I didn't lose any work, but it is still frustrating. My only other complaint so far is that neither the RAM nor the SSD drive is upgradeable. Using an external SSD drive solves the storage issue with negligible performance differences, so that issue has a workaround. As for the 8GB of RAM...",0
It's super light weight for the amount of power it has,0
Like I said laptops amazing. Amazing graphics well done! Quick fast and no issues. Only thing I see with it is it needs a better battery The battery is too short in life. Good for gaming. Video editing and watching movies. It's what I use it for,0
Good pc for the grandson.,0
I like it just fine,0
At first I was happy with this but it just randomly shuts off. It’s starting to do it more and more often. I’m trying to return it.,0
Excellent for the price!,0
It’s amazing,0
Agora o PC ficou do tamanho certo! Perfeito.,0
"After 5 months the laptop keyboard lights up, but no screen or boot attempt. Just hear fans cycling and the keyboard is just red. Id expect a laptop like this to last a few years before having problems. Never moved from my desk since opening it. Vastly disappointed.Update: Spoke to the customer support and they walked me through a driver reset and it resolved my issue. I was surprised how easy of a fix it was. Thank goodness no need to ship it in or go to a repair shop.",0
"I'm a 40 year old mom who wanted a small laptop for writing, and that's exactly what I got. It's perfect for my needs, small, light, and has decent battery life. I use it for streaming shows and movies, and browsing Pinterest, Instagram, and Twitter, and it also works perfect. My only complaint is the screen resolution gets pixelated when I try to zoom in when watching shows. I wouldn't think it's a good gaming computer, because if it was my 12 year old son would be begging to use it everyday. But, he doesn't, and I get it all to myself. If you want it for the basics, get this Chromebook, it's a good one.",0
"The screen was noticeably bright, as were the keyboard lights",0
"I needed a good computer for the money, and this was it. The sound could be better than what you get.",0
"Works great; the cord is a tad short, though.",0
Facial Recognition to unlock screen is broke.,0
"I bought this laptop to use with dual monitors set up through USB Type-C port. This computer is limited to data transfer only through the Type-C port. If I would have known that, I would have bought a Dell again.",0
I noticed that the fan kicked into high gear and it got very hot.,0
"What can you expect from a Dell Laptop? Affordability matched with quality. And that's what you get in this model of the Dell Inspiron. Those with processing-intensive tasks would do well to pick a device that matches their ambition, however for the go-to business professional, from PowerPoint presentations, to Office docs, to the internet, the Inspiron does its job, for which it was bought.Could do with a larger screen (laptop has 11.6in display), but for an easy carry-on for trips and travel, you can do no better!",0
"No fue para mí, fue una compra para mi hermano.La computadora está preciosa, el color está muy bonito, es muy ligera, la carga dura mucho… el único problema es que viene en inglés y es una lata estar configurándola para cambiarle el idioma porque no cambia todo y es un lío hacerla coincidir con el teclado, que no es latinomericano.",0
"First off: this computer is extremely lightweight, well built, and beautiful. Yes this is the new MacBook Air M1. And it arrived with 4 days after shipping (bad weather slowed it down so it arrived late).Battery: I’ve been on my computer for 12 hours today and battery is at 64%. I’ve had it for 3 days. And have only charged it once. And that was when it arrived while I set up. The computer is very quiet it and does not get hot. I’ve had several tabs open and applications at once and it didn’t even slow down or run hot.Camera: FaceTime calls are beautiful on here. Facebook messenger, you look a little yellow, but other people look perfect(probably lighting issue)Sound: is amazing, the best I have had on any computer. Crystal clear sound. This computer gets really loudSpeed: this computer is extremely fast. Internet sites load with a second. As soon as you sign in it’s an instant log on to your screen with no waiting for application to load.This by far the best computer I’ve had. If you are looking at your first MacBook laptop this is great(this is my first also). If you are looking to upgrade a really old MacBook model you will love this. Worth the money!",0
"It’s been a few years since I’ve purchased a MacBook as I have anas I have been using windows laptops the past seven or eight years. My intent for using this one was for a consulting business I am a part of doing teaching presentations, etc. I wanted something that was small and traveled easy but also durable. Using this was a pleasure from the keyboard to the color and clarity of the screen. It feels good in the hand and seems like a very premium and quality product I use this laptop for a job one day recently and literally at full brightness for around 8 1/2 hours on its battery. What I found is I liked it so much that I added more applications to make this my daily laptop but the standard 8 GB it came with just wasn’t enough. I was getting RAM full warnings at least once or twice a day. I have since given this laptop to my wife who had a 2011 Air and have purchased a new 16 GB M2 version for myself. As nice and robust, and as good looking as this laptop, is I highly recommend it but if you think for a moment that you might need extra ram, go ahead and bump up to the next level. in my opinion, this is the best $1000 laptop on the market with the best battery life and quality overall.",0
Es una buena computadora en mi caso es para programación y la verdad va muy bien en todos los aspectos su única limitación que yo veo es la memoria pero fuera de eso todo bien,0
"As a Mac lover, I need a Windows machine to take care some tasks. The ASUS ZenBook does the trick. I am sorry the RAM cannot be increased. The boot-up time is an impressive 25 seconds and handles apps like Dropbox well. I am particularly impressed with the responsive track pad compared to my older Windows machine made in 2014. All in all, great pick for the price.",0
my screen went out on me and i try'ed going back through this companyand there was nothing they could do even with my warranty and the hdd that was inside wasn't even the right size i was supposed to have,0
"Do not buy this crap!The only way to play fifa 17 is to open the bottom hood else it shuts down on the 10th minute!If you do not play games I dont know why you need 4gb of video moreover from 10x nvidia series!NFS Underground 2 (yes, an more than 10 years old game) also causes an shut downs due to overheating!This is the first laptop I see with 2 fans and almost NONE hot air outputs!",0
Make sure you get the one with the 3060 or higher graphics card. I have the 3060 card in mine and it runs just about every game I want it to on the highest settings with minimal to no lag or skipping.,0
the keyboard color scheme changer was a bit tricky to set up,0
Decent laoptop but PCs offer greater functionality for the $1K+ price tag. Performance and speed average when considering the price.,0
I was quite impressed with the specs and price point of this computer. I got the 1tb version hard drive. After about 10 minutes of the first starting up of computer we got a blue screen error. I proceeded to call Acer and they had me do any updates on software that were available. I think the update helped a little but we have had 2 more blue screen errors since. The computer has been in use less than 2 weeks. This should not be happening and as one reviewer stated he had to send computer back after major failure. The cause was supposedly a motherboard issue. Im just afraid that this too may be the problem with ours. Im going to monitor situation and read new reviews to see if this becomes a major issue.,0
"The first thing I did, and most people should do, was exit windows 10 S mode. Haven’t had any issues with it. Everything feels well made about it. The screen isn’t as nice as a MacBook but you’re paying a fraction of the price. If you can live with that then it’s a good buy.",0
I am old fashioned and like typing with a number pad way better than using the upper keys on a keyboard.,0
Omg súper bien,0
Delivered as advertised. I got this for my dad and now he won't stay off of it. It's screaming fast has a very solid construction.,0
"we will so disappointed with this laptop, respond very slow, it is not like a i7 cpu. we had ask for a return, but 4 days passed, nobody contact me. So disappointed with Canada Computer and Amazon.",0
I used this laptop for about 20 months since I bought it in the end of 2018.However the screen of the laptop suddenly did not show anything and also the laptop's power button went to turn off within 3-5 seconds even with being plugged in. I should have bought the extra warranty but I did not.They said I had to buy a new one. They must have provided me the lemon. I won't buy any electronics in Amazon anymore.,0
"The fan runs a lot, to make the laptop fast. Just play some music to cover it up. This is a PC you can take to your friends house, but don't forget the cord. This laptop will last a couple hours on battery with light use. The bloatware affects performance slightly, I will likely do a clean install at some point, but its not a major issue. Now, I don't know why hyper threading is disabled in BIOS OOTB but it is, and I noticed right away when MEmu would not load a single instance, yet once hyper threading was enabled, started right up. Maybe hyper threading is disabled for the same reason the go carts at the theme park are throttled: so nobody gets hurt. Maybe enabling hyper threading will make your laptop melt or light on fire (doubtful). Either way, mine has hyper threading enabled (in BIOS) and it is a fairly ambitious multitask er for any average user. In the 450-550 price range, this feels looks a good deal, on paper. remember, only 3 USB ports 1 reg 2 SS, no USB C no touchscreen, it comes with a disc drive that MAY come in handy. The laptop does not open fully flat, so be careful. SO, enable hyper threading in BIOS (at your own risk) as in my case I would have been 100% a dissatisfied customer if this laptop couldn't run multiple instances of MEmu to a greater degree than the aging i3 I still use everyday. So don't complain it is slow until you try a clean install with hyper threading enabled. Oh, and the screen is, a laptop screen, i guess. (I assume HDMI out works fine) its all white washed out compared to my PC monitor. I guess that's how laptop screens all are. I assume. Don't forget to disable all the ""occasionally show tips"" settings in Windows 10 to bring the process usage below 100% when doing nothing (long unfixed Windows 10 bug). When properly configured, this is a fast laptop in the i5 8th Gen arena. So Far So Good",0
"But expect fatigue if you are trying to type reports, essays, articles, or a novel.",0
"I purchased this machine with the purpose of replacing a 9-year-old laptop. I wanted a work machine that can play current gen games away from home and this laptop does the job well, but comes with annoying bloatware and has a ""meh"" internal battery when using work applications. The charging block that comes with it is cumbersome and large, and it makes it hard to situate myself in a public area if I need the charger. This is less of an issue during Covid-era, but is something to consider when purchasing it. The cool thing about it is that it charges very quickly.Wifi works fine and it comes with a ethernet cord slot when you need it. Video quality is good and refresh rate is adequate.Form Factor is strange as the GTX 1660ti pushes past the hinge of the screen, so you have the fans and video components jut out about an inch from where the base of the screen rests. Not a big deal, but definitely different than other laptops.This thing runs pretty hot, and the speakers are on the underside of the machine, if that matters to you. The keyboard feels very tactile and nice, but already prone to dust like a normal mechanical keyboard. I had to use a can of air to get some debris under the right arrow button out straight from the box, which was a bummer. You shouldn't eat while typing or working over a keyboard, but I foresee that being an even worse dilemma for anyone who does purchase this and doesn't heed that advice. The keys seem fragile, and made me too worried to make an attempt to pry off for further inspection.Finally, the computer comes preloaded with software called Lenovo Vantage. It has some features that are useful and not standard to Windows 10, but it also will show you ads in the notification section of your OS, so I was really not jazzed about that.I'll probably forget to update this review down the line if my feelings change, but if it's anything like the last laptop I had, I'll probably bump it up a star or two based on longevity.",0
Occasionally have issues getting the WiFi to connect.,0
As advertised!,0
S.L.O.W.,0
The SLOWEST overpriced laptop I have ever owned. Open 3 windows and it closes. It won't allow you to install anything except Microsoft products: no Chome or Firefox.,0
There are no negative issues with this product st this time!,0
"We opened it up to install RAM (it runs happily with 40 gigabytes!). I have never seen a cleaner, more straightforward design. Truly elegant, complete with a way to replace a range of components (including the battery). The machine works flawlessly - powerful, fast, and capable. I supplemented it with an external keyboard (I like more throw), a good stand, and it also drives external monitors.",0
"great laptop for the money. Its slower than I imagined with the speed that was listed but, it keeps up. I would purchase again and recommended to a friend and they purchase the same one. I do wish it would have came with a free version of Office instead of the trial.",0
Good product... just not the newest version,0
"It was a gift for my daughter, and she loves it!! Not to big or to small, just right",0
"I ordered this laptop mainly for traveling. It is the perfect size for that…..thin, light, and the screen is just the right size. I wouldn’t want to go any smaller, or any larger for that matter due to wanting to keep the weight in check.It’s perfect for going on the internet or watching movies. I have watched a couple of HD movies on it, and they looked incredible and played perfectly.The case is nearly all metal and it feels very solid. At just a little over 2.5 pounds, it feels light, particularly for its screen size. It is also absolutely quiet. I ran a couple of games on it, and while doing so it did get fairly warm, but nothing to be concerned about.The feel of the keys takes a little getting used to because they’re a little on the spongy side, but after a bit of typing I found that I started to adapt to them fairly quickly. The fact that they are backlit makes a world of difference, one of the features that I love the most.The screen is plenty bright with beautiful colors and has sharp text display, plus it has good viewing angles. It does not have touchscreen capability, which is not a big deal to me…..honestly, I never use that feature anyway. It has a matte finish that pretty much eliminates reflections.I love that it comes with a Thunderbolt 4 port, albeit only one, and has also left in an HDMI port, which will come in handy for family vacations should I want to connect to an external TV to watch movies in the hotel room.It also has two USB 3.1 ports, one on each side, plus a headphone jack. It can be charged with the included cable with the traditional brick in the middle, or through the USB-C Thunderbolt connection.I used it fairly constantly for about six hours, and it still had plenty of battery life left. The SSD is upgradeable, but I doubt I will bother with that…..for me, 512GB is plenty.It does come with a lot of bloat-ware loaded onto it (e.g., trial version of Norton and Office), so I took a little time to clean that stuff off.Overall, I am more than happy with this laptop and do recommend it, especially if you are looking for one to travel with. The fact that it has a Core i7-1165G7 processor and an SSD makes it plenty snappy, and the screen resolution is excellent.If things change as I use it more I will update this review. I hope it helped you to some degree, thanks for reading!",0

"7 months ago, there was an issue where the laptop glitched into oblivion. It would not turn on. After contacting Lenovo support, they sent a guy in for onsite repair, and all was fine. However, within a day, a similar but new issue sprang up: The laptop would not turn on, but the fans would be spinning at full blast. A power drain seemed to fix the issue, and everything was fine until mid-late April. Now, whenever the laptop goes to sleep or shuts down, there is a chance that it won't be able to turn back on. Everything will be off, but the fans will be spinning. Each time this occurs, I have to open up the laptop to disconnect the battery from the motherboard just so I can do a power drain. Sometimes this takes 20 seconds, other 90+, and the two times it took over 30 minutes. Support is slow and isn't helpful. I no longer care for a replacement when the issue could come right again around the corner, but without a warranty. I'm done. Learn from my mistake. Avoid laptops, or avoid Lenovo Laptops, and go build a PC.",0
I used it for gaming it works great,0
Thank you great product,0

"Bonito modelo, funcional, bastante ligero, no obstante solo encontré 1 memoria RAM de 4GB, además había leído que venía con 1 hdd de 1 TB, pero no lo tenía, viene el espacio pero no trae el cable ni el flex para conectarlo. Habría que comprarlo por aparte.",0

My son loves his laptop...,0
"Bought this laptop after doing many hours of research.... So far I love it!Pros:Super fast boot time.Very little bloatware.Upgradeable Ram.Additional hard drive slot (I got the 250gb ssd version and will probably add a 1tb hdd)While running multiple Google Chrome tabs, watching a video on YouTube, and running a full anti-virus scan the laptop was still silent (fans weren't even noticeable).Laptop stays cool on your lap.Keyboard is quiet.Laptop is super thin and light weight which makes if very portable.Cons:Display isn't that great (this is something I didn't really care about). For $620 you probably won't be able to find any laptop with these specs and a great display. There's always going to be a tradeoff. I chose to downgrade on the display and processor (i got the 8th gen i5 version which is more than enough power for me).Webcam kind of sucks - This is something I really don't care about since I'll probably never use it.Keyboard flex - Almost all ASUS laptops have a little keyboard flex and it was the main thing that scared me about buying this laptop. After using the laptop for a few days, I can officially say that I'm not even bothered by it. It's very comfortable to type with!No numeric keypad - Again something I didn't really care about.Not sure about battery life yet but I'm thinking you can get 6-8 hours out of this thing if you fool around with some settings. This wasn't a big deal to me since I'm always a few feet away from an outlet if I need a charge.Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase! There's so many laptops out there and almost all of them have mixed reviews (which makes it incredibly difficult to pick one).I'll give a 1 month, 6 month, and 1 year update (if I can remember to do so)",0
"This laptop is a workhorse. I cannot believe how fast it is. It does not matter whether playing video games, hard core streaming, compiling code, or just running through emails. The display is crisp and even the built in speakers are surprising. To have all this horsepower it is extraordinarily thin and lightweight without feeling brittle. The only thing that I would like is for the touch pad to be moved to the left just a tiny bit and be centered under the space bar. This does not come into play very often though as I use a mouse when I have a lot of work to do. I have not turned my desk top on since I got this computer.",0
"I purchased this to replace my Dell laptop. As far as hardware goes, the MSI is superior to the new Dell that I was considering, but I found a few things to be annoying.I almost always use a mouse. Every laptop I have ever owned had the AC port on the left side, but on this laptop, it's on the right side, so the cable gets in the way.Keyboard layout is slightly different, but what really annoys me, is that I have to use the function key plus another key for HOME, END, VOLUME UP, VOLUME DOWN, MUTE, BRIGHTNESS UP, BRIGHTNESS DOWN. All these functions on my old Dell were one key, now I have to use both hands for any of those.I was aware that this laptop did not have a touchscreen display, but I underestimated how much I would miss it.",0
"The Chromebook itself seems great but then after 13 months, after the warranty expired the mouse pad no longer was useable. Luckily I bought the Asurion plan so I was thankful I did. They received the Chromebook and told me it would be 10 days, which was fine. I then received a phone call from a Robert saying unfortunately they had to order the part it would be in on Sept. 20th, 2020. They would then next day it to us. Still fine. Well I then receive an email on August 28th saying they were sorry the Chromebook could not be fixed they will return our money. They didn't even have the part yet? So did they try to even fix it? We paid $227 a year ago. I think honestly they are keeping it to fix and resale for the crazy $400 and above price. Completely unacceptable. Will never but Asurion again or a Chromebook from Amazon. Yes, I called several times to get answers, I'm actually sitting on hold right now for the 10th time so far it's been 31 minutes! They are impossible to get a hold of. Just talk to a Cindy and apparently Hp is no longer making the replacement part! Not sure why they are still selling this product, if thats the case.",0
"This is the second ASUS laptop that I have bought. I needed a new one after about 7 years, and I wanted something smaller and lighter, especially as I would be travelling. (The bigger one was harder to carry to college, which was one of its cons.) The new laptop is exactly what I wanted! I love holding it because it's so small, and I look forward to being able to carry it around without trouble.I will try to update when I have had a chance to use it more.",0
"Bought this and returned it. There's a lot to like about this laptop if you are basically just surfing the internet and watching YouTube and doing some word processing or occasional photo dump. Light, well-built, decent ports (although a mini SD port seems rather useless). But the screen quality was a big letdown. It's dull, and viewing angles are very limited. It's no fun to look at. Also sound quality and volume is very marginal. Someone suggested adding an additional monitor and separate speakers, but WTH, why am I rebuilding a computer I just bought? Good for a student on the fly, perhaps, but not for the serious user for work.",0
"El display es impresionante, sumamente rápido en todo, la calidad de construcción es excelente y el performance en gaming es sumamente bueno, levanta cualquier juego que le pongas, eso sí, no es una 2080Ti, no esperes correr todo en ultra a 4k, pero mueve cualquier juego en medios-altos a 1080p a más de 60fps.la batería no es muy buena, pero no es para nada un factor que me importe, ya que generalmente yo la tengo conectada siempre para jugar.el procesador es sumamente poderoso para cualquier tarea, y hasta el tomacorriente es pequeño y estético.",0
"Está bonita la laptop, el teclado es suave, la pantalla no es la mejor, pero es buena, tienes que encontrar el ángulo para ver bien los colores, tener cuidado con las luces que pudiera tener en frente de la pantalla porque si refleja mucho la luz. Es liviana, ideal para llevarla a donde quieras. Tiene buen rendimiento de la batería, me imaginaba que sería un poco más rápida, no es lenta, pero si pienso que en algunas ocasiones no responde fluido. En general es una MUY BUENA laptop.",0
I'm still getting used to it but so for so good. I was surprised to see that the color of this unit is not the soft gold/champagne I see in the pictures but a warm silver. I was upset at first but I actually like it better. Update to follow.,0
Product better than expected.,0
"Have had this computer since 7/20 and it has been in for repair three times. I still have not received my daughters computer as it is still in Texas on the third repair. Even going through the factory repair suggestions and procedures, I still don't have the computer back. My daughter is heartbroken and need this for school. 750.00 dollars down the drain in my opinion. I would look elsewhere for a more reliable machine. You have been warned.",0

It’s a slim computer. Visually it’s great. Screen quality is perfect,0
Dumps wifi driver and requires hard reset at least twice a week.,0
Honestly all I know is that my daughter loves it and thats all that matters to me!,0
"worst possible purchase. you would have a better online experience using a phonograph. it is so slow, regardless of wifi speed, crashes every 10 minutes, and is incapable with nearly every software. this laptop isnt even good if all youre doing is launching chrome and closing it out immediately: that would make it crash. youtube videos are impossible to watch, the moon landing broadcast had less lag. to delete a file you need to go thru 10 loopholes, bc you have to do that incredibly often bc theres no storage room on this. i absolutely hate it and am buying ANYTHING other than a chromebook in the future. google just wants to collect your information and watch you AND THATS IT. luckily, the camera quality on this is so bad there will be a blur covering what you dont want shown anyway, but its the principle. never buy this.",0
"La computadora es excelente, básicamente corre cualquier juego a 1080p, la unica recomendación es que si vas a descargar juegos muy pesados, le compres un disco duro externo.",0
I had it for three months and had to ship it back to the manufacturer. Don't waste your time!,0
"I bought this laptop about 1 year ago and it works great, I have had no issues with it. That being said I would also like to point out that I am extremely careful with my thing, and I take care of them. I still have a Dell Inspiron N5110 with an Intel Core i5-2410M in it and it still works great. Bought that from Best buy back in 2011 for $700.",0
"Got this laptop for my son's 9th birthday. He really wanted a laptop to play Minecraft with his friend, and thought it was a good opportunity for him to learn how to work a pc too (only been doing iPad so). Set up was fairly easy, comes with month of free Norton antivirus, after that need to pay or look for something else. It's like a regular Windows computer (we don't have that much knowledge about Windows or hardcore gaming), but works well with both PE and java Minecraft (although there was an incident where PE version got stuck at the red open screen. had to look online to figure out the fix. adjusted the screen frame rate or something and got fixed i think). He also plays Roblox, and is starting to explore other games with it.Love how the laptop it self looks though. The design is cool, and seems like a fashionable design for gamers. Love the red lit keyboards (at first I was hoping it'd be a different color, but not bad).Battery life doesn't seem to hold that much, but we keep it plugged in most of the time. Screen quality can be better compared to other pcs, but is good enough.",0
the mouse is almost completely unresponsive and makes scrolling or browsing (the main purpose of this laptop) nearly impossible. I am not picky but this is unusable! Do not buy this laptop! I am out of the 30 day return policy otherwise I would return this asap!,0
"A couple of months in and it has been a great purchase, you might want to go for the newer versions with a better gpu, but even with just a 1660ti it is a great machine for productivity as well as decently high-resolution gaming.",0
I’m currently using it for work and it’s like a charm 😊,0
"So I wanted something inexpensive to do basic things. Watch Hulu or Netflix and download music on iTunes. iTunes works well enough but I don't know why watching Hulu is so problematic. It'll stutter frequently and it's not from poor internet speeds, it has to do with the speed of the laptop. Videos will become pixelated and there video will pause but the sound will continue. I actually decided to NOT use my laptop for watching videos which is quite disappointing to say the very least! I wasn't expecting much because I wasn't needing much, but apparently it can't even handle videos. Maybe mine is deffective, I don't know. Pretty disappointed unfortunately.",0
Battery life and wireless connection only fair.,0
Don't like that you basically need internet connection to use.,0

"this is light weight, thin and the overall display is quite nice",0
"A very good return for your money, fast and intuitive.",0
"I have nothing bad to say about this laptop yet, although I have not had it for that long. I can say I love the keyboard great feel and response. The screen also looks quite good. And so far it has run ever program without any trouble at all so definitely powerful enough for almost every video game at the moment. I have WOT running right now along with eight tabs of chrome, and can't even tell the difference. I did take off the bottom cover to add another hard drive. It is hard but doable. Just start at the corners under the screen and make sure you get the right storage. The only thing that I do not love so far is the trackpad, but who uses that on a gaming laptop. The fans can also get very very loud. The only other thing I have to say is that I like all dragon center as a computer control center. So for me, it has totally been worth the money.",0
Excellent Value can’t believe it was only $300 works excellent no problems at all surprisingly good build quality,0
"Color on monitor is terrible, can't hardly se anythingwould not buy again",0
I do not play games n i do not use touch screen. Works great for my use.,0
My tablet works great. No problems so far.,0

WiFi connection is fast. Connection with printer must be google cloud print enabled. I connected my HP printer over WiFi no problem. The computer is fast and easy to set up. Not full of ads. Speakers are fine. Keyboard is easy to use.,0
"Love this Chromebook and use it constantly. Biggest complaint is that there is no contrast adjustment to the video, Videos are darker than I like but cannot find any way to adjust it.It is something I have to get used to but cannot understand why this function is not available.Everything else is great but this is a big problem for me.I hope they have an update somewhere down the line that will address this issue.",0
"The shipping was a little scary, I didnt think I was going to receive it all, and the order updated and it was delivered the next day. That being said this thing is great. Started right up and immediately connected to the internet. Screen quality is good. For the price you really cant go wrong. It may not last as long as others, or it may! Who knows but for $200 you're getting a good deal. For at home everyday use? Checking emails, YouTube, ETC this is a perfect buy.",0
"I love the light weight and portability, the extra cores are nice for running visual studio, sql server, and IIS all at the same time with no degradation to performance.",0
"Computer crash in 1 month,for all that money it sucks.",0
"The fans are VERY loud and the speakers are kind of quiet. So, there is no way to hear well when running a program that makes use of the video card.Do not expect to play audio for a group of people even if just presenting slides. The speaker does not project at all.Using a cooling pad with fans will keep it cool and actually reduce the overall noise.I love how fast it boots up and shuts down. The graphics are quite good.",0
The wifi card on this seems really strong as I always have a consistent fast connection with no drop outs.,0
The keyboard lights up with different colors which is something he really likes with his computers.,0
The fans will get quite loud during gaming,0
"What I don't like is that every few months there's an update which crashes my computer. Up until now I fixed it with recover. At this point, 6 months in, it is totally crashed with a stop code. I'm trying to get support but the serial number are these tiny numbers on the motherboard which don't distinguish between 0 and 0. I am so disappointed in this product!",0
"Updated review with more detail [after 2 weeks]. ** See additional note re color.I switched to Mac 11 years ago, and for that entire period, I had the same laptop, a Macbook Pro, late-2011 model. After the initial adjustment, it has been a great laptop for all of these years. I used it for school, work, online browsing, a few applications, and streaming videos. I have never gamed on my 2011 laptop. Of course, it slowed down considerably after several years, and software and hardware updates can only help so much with an older model. So, I finally decided to purchase a new laptop, and based on my research on recent macbook models, the price and value was right on this 2020 Macbook Air.GENERAL FEATURES: Switching from a Pro to an Air model is weird at first because the Air is SO thin and lightweight. It has an extremely slim profile. I have to be extra careful when I grab the laptop to move to another room. Like other reviewers have said, the screen extends almost to the edge with minimal bezel, which also means very minimal border, so you are getting a ""larger"" screen. I did not mind the thick bezel black border on my pro and have been used to it for so long, but I took for granted that it actually provided a lot of protection for my screen. The macbook air has almost no bezel, which in my opinion, is not ideal. Let's hope it doesn't drop or get off balance because there is basically no protection for the screen. My older macbook pro has fallen a few times on it's corner or edge in 11 years and been fine, aside from minor cosmetic damage. But the larger edge and bezel came in really handy on the macbook pro when it lost balance and fell off the counter several years ago, but I quickly saved it by grabbing it by the screen and significantly reducing the impact when it landed [luckily not on hard floor]. Obviously not an ideal way to grab it, but it was a necessary save in that moment. The only damage was cracks through the top of my screen from the pressure of my palm, and some minor dent in the bottom of the laptop. Cosmetic damage, but thankfully did not effect the screen light, LCD, or anything else. I do not think the macbook air would survive this, especially how the screen is built.BATTERY: Upon opening the box, the battery life was already pretty high, and I decided not to charge it until the battery decreased to around 10-15%. I was still using my original macbook during the day for work, and the new macbook air during the evening for mostly online use and going through all of the system preferences and settings, and watching youtube in the background. Keeping that limited use in mind, I did not need to charge it for maybe 1 week. Great battery life thus far. I will likely be shifting to use this macbook air for work soon, in order to take advantage of the current OS, higher ram, and M1 chip, especially because I connect to virtual servers, which can take a toll on the ram and processor.SPEED/PORTS/BLUETOOTH: Compared to an older model pro, it has good speeds so far. I already knew that the number of ports have been reduced significantly, and that air has less ports than a pro anyway, so I purchased a thunderbolt adapter and a USB hub in advance to take care of that issue. So far, the thunderbolt adapter works fine to connect the macbook air to my Thunderbolt Display monitor. The bluetooth was able to connect to my ear buds, although pairing did take a bit longer than I expected. The bluetooth preferences do seem to be less detailed/less options than my previous macbook pro.CHARGER: ** In my opinion, the previous magnetic chargers were superior to the current ones. They attached via magnet, the indicator light was red while charging, and green when fully charged. Easy and convenient. The mag-safe charger on this computer requires an additional push to be plugged in fully. This is just like most electronic devices, so it is not a bad feature, just requires an adjustment. It is probably safer for the computer and prevents it from easily coming unplugged. However, there is no indicator light, so you can't tell that it is plugged in and successfully charging unless you look at the battery status in the menu bar, and you also cannot see when it is finished charging just at a glance. You cannot confirm when the laptop is closed or on lock screen. You have to open the laptop, log in, and then check. Big bummer. **MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES: My previous macbook had a great feature: check the battery life at a glance with a quick push of a button while the laptop is still closed. After some additional research, I realized that apple removed the battery light indicator on the macbook pros many years ago, and that airs never had this feature. Big bummer. There is no way to check the battery life on this model without opening the laptop AND logging in, as the battery status in the menu bar on lock screen only shows the icon, but won't show you the percentage until you log in. Not ideal at all.-------Quick review for recently purchased product [during Black Friday]. I will update with a more detailed review once I have used it for a longer period.***** Important Note: If you are on the fence about purchasing the ""gold,"" don't get it. I had a silver MacBook Pro for many years, and I went back and forth for several days about the gold, especially after reading recent reviews and viewing customer images on multiple retailers that said the gold is closer to rose gold. I would disagree and say that the color is actually better described as dark blush pink or dark a reddish-mauve. Definitely not the look I wanted to have, and I regret not purchasing the staple silver, especially as I keep my electronics for many years beyond the 'normal time.' It would be a hassle and a lot of money to purchase the silver instead, since we cannot exchange in-store.",0
"Literally the best laptop I've ever owned, I love it. It is perfect for my needs as a college student who does some light gaming and always has about 20 tabs opened. With my old laptop every time I turned it on it was like an old man waking up from a nap and was super laggy, but this laptop is lighting fast. It is also lightweight and has amazing battery life. Plus, the fingerprint reader is an awesome touch.",0
The screen is awesome. Everyone at my university have really dim laptops. Mine sticks out because of the brightness and colors. Has everything you need to be used as a productivity machine. You can use it for light gaming.,0
"Individuals often discount gaming computers because they are not gamers. However computing power is essential for anyone using computers to do more than check email. Dual boot SSDs are crucial. Regular use of programs such as Clean my PC, and Norton Utilities will prolong computer life. I have a 2011 Mac that runs great, both Windows and Mac OS. I have an 2016 MSI Dragon that still rocks.",0
"This is my 4th Mac laptop, the earlier ones were all MacBook Pros. I was reticent about getting an Air, but with the M1 chip, this thing is a superb replacement. So small & light, yet speedy. Only drawback is the fixed 8GB RAM complement. I take care not to send the thing into swap- suspending old browser tabs is essential.",0
The video card does not seem to work with the built in monitor,0
Superior to my previous Chromebook. I love it!,0
Bought for my daughter who really didn't appreciate it. I thought this was a great gaming computer but she was soo ungrateful I returned it. Im certain that anyone else would love this computer though.,0
This chrome book cannot connect to the internet from my basement. My HP laptop does fine. Disappointed by this. Cannot really comment on anything else since I have not used that much because of this lack of connection power.,0
"Hard to say anything bad. Looks good, fast, runs the software that is needed for my wife’s work.",0
The upgraded 1080p screen is well worth buying this version for if you watch videos.,0
"Love this laptop. Battery life is amazing for video games on the go, the display is bright, graphics are good. I got the gtx 1650 but recommend the cheapest RTX model now that it's out (3050 i think)",0
It has a great layout and customizing the colors per key is pretty slick.,0
Très bien.,0
while the system asks me to restart the laptop for some speakers issue which is kind annoying,0
"Excellent product. Unpacked it, plugged it in and it worked perfectly. Battery charged quickly.",0
"TENGO 1 AÑO CON LA LAPTOP Y HASTA EL MOMENTO HA FUNCIONADO MUY BIEN, ESTOY SATISFECHO CON MI COMPRA, LO UNICO MALO Y POR LO CUAL LE QUITO 1 ESTRELLA ES QUE AL ACTIVAR/DESACTIVAR LAS MAYUSCULAS NO SE PRENDE NINGUNA LUZ QUE TE LO INDIQUE, SE TIENE QUE ESCRIBIR EN ALGUNA PARTE PARA SABER SI ESTA ACTIVADO.",0
Bought this for my husbands man cave. He's very happy with it and weve not had any problems yet.,0
I am very satisfied with this lap top,0
"I liked the small form factor and sleek outward appearance of this laptop but have been disappointed with the performance, battery life, and how noisy it is. I can live with the battery life and performance issues, but the noise is really intolerable. I was replacing my old ASUS 17 inch laptop and wanted to order reasonably high end specs, but even though the specs are higher end than my old system, it barely seems faster, and at times there are inordinate delays in responsiveness. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised at the short battery life of the system because there isn't much room to fit a battery in such a small package, and that actually isn't that big a problem since I mostly use the system at home and can reconnect to power whenever I need to, but its still disappointing. I seem to get 3-4 hours from a full charge. The really annoying issue is that the cooling fan seems to run noisily when I am barely doing anything with the system, and once it starts running it doesn't want to stop unless I turn the system off. I regret purchasing this system and I haven't even finished paying for it yet.",0
"Just buy the new one. I spent a total of 5 hours on the phone between Amazon's support like (they knew nothing), Microsoft (completely unhelpful) and HP (they knew a lot but couldn't fix the problem). Basically, the machine was convinced that the Windows software was illegitimate. It was a cascade of problems caused by how the software was downloaded onto the refurbished machine. I returned it and bought a new machine, and everything is working perfectly. Got it set up in 10 minutes. Do yourself a favor, and spend the few extra dollars.",0
"This is a great computer great for multi-tasking. I am very pleased, thank you!",0
Got it for my daughter for school. I asked her after she spent some time with it- how is it? Her response was- I LIKE IT!!! That answers all my questions! That's all I want to know. Apple ??,0
I use this for my online classes in college and homework! good for basic college needs!,0
Great machine. Top of the line. Super unit for games or normal use. Current technology. Only complaint it the touch pad is the same color and texture as the keyboard surface and hared to locate without looking at it.,0
"First off, I would be reviewing this laptop for build quality, its screen, sound quality, and obviously the performance. Since the review might become lengthy, I will state that I truly enjoy this laptop and do not regret buying at at such a low price point. At the time of this review, the price has jumped up to $950; much greater than the $850 I got it for in early May. I have been using this laptop for about 2 and a half months and feel like I should be able to give a detailed review.Build Quality: 3.8/5The entire laptop is covered in plastic but it does not feel cheap. The primary issue I have with the plastic is that in some areas, it doesn't feel sturdy. The screen can easily flex if you grab it on both sides and barely move it. Compared to my sibling's Samsung Odyssey, the plastics used on this laptop are much cheaper feeling and less durable. The plastic right above the function keys also feels slightly flimsy and thin. Other than that, the laptop is very solidly built for the price point.Screen: 3/5The screen has horrible viewing angles and at dim settings, it's hard to see even while indoors. I can't imagine how bad it would be if I was outside during a summer day trying to accomplish any work on this laptop while at a cafe. When the screen is set at the perfect angle and brightness, it's a decent screen at most. If the panel was IPS with a glass cover rather than whatever is currently covering the panel, the quality would be so much more realistic. I currently hook up my laptop to a 24inch Samsung monitor that has much better viewing angles and color accuracy.Sound: 2/5The speakers are mounted at the bottom of the laptop by the LED indicators to the left and right of the trackpad. They sound muffled and quiet due to them being pointing towards the table rather than your face. If the speakers were mounted at the empty area above the function keys, sound quality would be much improved and clearer. The headphone port does not disappoint and can decently power my 50ohm HD598s.Performance: 4/5For a 1050TI, it can run fortnite at 60FPS at Ultra and High settings (Ultra For view distance, High for everything else except shadows and anti-aliasing, shadows are turned of and AA is on medium). There are some moments after playing for 2 or 3 hours that it start to thermal throttle a bit and my FPS drops to 15 to 30 fps. This happens even with me turning up the fan speeds in the advanced settings in the MSI Dragon Center and using a laptop cooler with 4 fans at max speed. I can easily run Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance at 60FPS at max settings, no issues and I have low CPU and GPU temps of at most 60C. On League of Legends, I put shadows on low, effects on high, and everything else at MAX and cap the FPS at 80. The FPS hovers around 68 to 73 during decent teamfights and sometimes drops down to the high 50s during 5v5 teamfights near Baron. I would think with improved cooling, the laptop would perform more consistently in Fortnite, but in League; I would say slightly lowering my settings would keep it at 80 no problem. The problems I've stated would be fixed if I had gotten the version with a 1060 but that was far out of my budget.TL;DR: Plastics are cheap in some areas, the screen is overall not good, the speakers are subpar, the GPU performs well in popular titles such as Fortnite and League of Legends at 60fps at medium to high settings. Higher settings such as Ultra or max in some areas would start to thermal throttle the computer and cause FPS drops.",0
Bought this for my 6 year old to do school work during the pandemic. He loves it! It’s easy for him to navigate using the touch screen and being able to hold like a tablet is more manageable for him.,0

"I bought this laptop for my husband for his 65th birthday. His laptop was 11 years old and was on it’s last leg. He was afraid to buy a new laptop because he thought things had become too techy in the past 11 years but this one is perfect! The screen is crystal clear and the keys are large enough for his big bulky fingers. He plays word games and does puzzles, explores websites, he emails,,spends time on Facebook, checks out his sports, neighborhood stuff, etc… and if he wants to explore more, he can. It’s super fast and stays connected to our wifi with ease.It’s perfect and the price was SO right!! Oh, I also purchased the insurance plan just in case. That too is a great deal and great idea, in my opinion!5 Stars!",0
"This product was advertised as new. When I opened it, there were two user profiles already set up (see photo) and the language was set for a non-English language. When I called Amazon, they sent me to Dell. When I called Dell, they said the computer (which I purchased on 9/21/19) was originally purchased/set up in June.I am returning this. I bought it for my kid. Kids can be rough on equipment, so I want to give him the benefit of starting with new equipment. Also, who knows what the prior owner did with it.",0
"So far i've enjoyed this laptop,ever since alienware sold their soul to dell,i've used majority of MSI products.I've use their motherboard to build my own desktop,and decided i needed laptop for school(i do use it for school purposes......occasionally hahaha).The keyboard lights is something i've always liked due to the fact i stay up late playing games or doing work,haven't tested the camera yet so i'm unable to give my opinion about it.Video card seems pretty awesome for it's 4g size,i've had no issues playing games like final fantasy 14,league of legends,total war:warhammer 2.The graphics are flawless.Love the anti-glare screen,freaking magical cause it's always been a issue of mine when playing during the day.The laptop case is neat,just notice don't touch any oily or greasey cause it'll leave marks but they are easily wiped away.The cooling fans work perfectly,laptop never really gets too hot unless i'm balls to the walls gaming,notice it does get kinda loud but it's expect when you're trying to keep something like this cool.Something that caught me by surprise was lack of cd-rom slot,now this is my first time owning a ultra light notebook so i guess that's a standard thing since the industary is going away with cds and moving to downloads/cloudservers.dragon center is a really cool app to keep track of the usage and temp of the laptop,but all around i believe this is worth the price i paid.",0

"I am a professional architectural photographer and videographer who needs a powerful enough laptop for when I am on the road. Additionally, I need adequate color accuracy, which so many laptops don't offer. I took a risk on this one and am happy to say that, though this is not a wide gamut panel, 100% of sRGB is covered, according to my Spyder 5. I edit on wide gamut 2K monitors in my home studio, but for the road, sRGB is fine. And it's a decent looking matte finish panel. My older laptop had a 4K wide gamut panel, which is superior...but this Sager is absolutely adequate, even at only 1080p.I decided to upgrade recently and was looking hard at Ryzen, which to be honest, I would have preferred to Intel. Unfortunately there's not yet enough OEM support and availability, so I decided to pull the trigger on this machine, which I consider an excellent deal at $1,500, especially with the ability to pop another NVMe SSD in there. And anyway, Intel still does fine with Photoshop...even better slightly better in some ways than one of the better Ryzens. This machine is a big step up from my four year old i7-6700h with 16gb of RAM. With 32gb of RAM and a pretty fast processor, I am not worried about editing video either.Reading some reviews, I was worried about the thermal performance of this machine. To see how it does for what I need, I ran PugetBench for Photoshop on it today, just after receiving it. As you can see, the benchmark spiked the first three cores to 92/3c or just over, but never for more than a second or two. The laptop never felt exceedingly hot...and, in my everyday use, I will rarely if ever push it that hard. For gaming I cannot say...it could be an issue. I just have no way of knowing. (By the way, I ran the benchmark with the laptop flat on a wood table in a room at about 79f.) Take a look at the most recent results and you'll see that this laptop did very well against similar machines.The build quality is adequate. It's a simple design that that does not look too much like a gaming machine...and I think it's pretty appealing in appearance. It feels a little plastic...but still solid. The track pad is better than on my old laptop, but I generally use a mouse and Wacom so the trackpad is not too important. The keyboard feels decent and the backlight is good. This appears to be a clean Windows install and there's no bloatware I have encountered.All in all, I give this machine five stars. If the build quality were just a bit better, I'd say a resounding five stars. This laptop is a bargain at $1,500...just great bang for the buck. Thanks, Sager. I am very happy with this purchase.",0
"as far as touch and the keyboard, it is smooth and easy to type",0
"As a previous computer salesman, the i3-11th gen in 2022 is more than suitable for a majority of computer users.Acer got a bad rap for their early 2000s computers, and yes while they are still a value brand, they have come a long way and made a reliable and functional computer for the everyday person while offering a terrific value on hardware. Currently, the price is about what Chromebooks are going for - the equivalent of Dell is $100 more, as of writing.The screen is great at this cost, there is some light bleeding but if you don't know what that is, then you don't have to worry about it. You get a ton of ports for connectivity that is slowly going away with the higher-end laptops.The laptop comes with Windows 10, which is in S-mode and will need to be updated if you want to run applications, not from the Windows store (Google Chrome, Steam, Zoom, etc.)The unit is upgradable in ram and hard drive capacity, which is great since this unit comes with the lower end of both - but should be fine for the average computer user.",0
A great computer for kids school work or a first pc. Actually anyone would like this if they need a good computer and the size is decent.,0

"I've owned two Mac's (one Pro one Air) prior to this one and only purchased a new Mac because my last one was too old and could no longer support Google Chrome, videos, etc. In two months there have been several hairline cracks develop on my screen and the trackpad has cracked without any impact. My previous Macs have been indestructible so this change must be from the new construction. I was told there's no way to prevent the same damage to the trackpad in the future which makes me relatively concerned about ongoing cost if the same problem continues to occur. I would purchase an older, more durable model before this one, or be sure to get AppleCare+ because they aren't quite made to last as they used to be! Without these issues it would be a great computer, it's fast, light, portable, and holds long battery life, but the constant need to get costly repairs just doesn't offset it!",0

"Great value! obviously not a gaming laptop, and the display would be nice to have a higher resolution than 1600x900, but I like all these features - can drive (via its HDMI port) a 4k external display; intel HD graphics 620 is decent performance for non-gamers - has a USB-C port - has a 4core/8thread i5 CPU - great keyboard! - good audio for a budget laptop - 1 slot of DDR4 RAM easy to upgrade with an extra 16 GB stick for a total of 20 GB,should suffice for most peopleCons - keyboard up/down arrows are half size - 1TB drive is not very fast, but easy to replace with an SSD, so still a great value - the other slot of DDR4 RAM can't be upgraded, not even visible without completely disassembling the laptop; may be soldered in, didn't want to take the chance, in any case 20 GB was enough for me, so still 5 stars, but thought I'd mention it for others",0

"I order this in April 2022. For $1.5k which is A LOT of money for me to spend on a laptop. I am upgrading from an Acer Predator Helios 315-52 which I got for $900. But hey... its not 2018 anymore. I upgraded to this for a better GPU, CPU and some quality of life features. I intended to use this laptop for Programming, 3D Designing, and some gaming.Remember that you DO NOT have to create a Microsoft account to use your laptop. Just press FN+ F12 to have it on Air Plane mode. Without internet you can create local user. This is important for your privacy.What I was looking for:Value CPUValue GPUValue RAMUpgradabilityThunderbolt 4Organized IOEnergy EfficientThings I could have lived without:RGBTech Ecosystem""cool"" designPROS:- 12th Gen i7 is the best at the moment. Any 12th gen i9 will thermal throttle. So no point in paying more for no real life benefit.- 3060 is good. I wish there was a 3070 ti version.- MUX switch- Thunderbolt 4 for easy docking. Not sure yet if you can charge from this port or not.- Most IO are on left hand side. Would have preferred having it on the back but this is okay.- Customizable keyboard color so it doesn't have to stay 1 gamery shade of rainbow.- Wifi 6 while still having the Ethernet option- Upgradable RAM and Storage- Comparable Acer Nitros were around $1800. Decided to save the money and use it for a color accurate monitor or new RAM- Adjustable fan speed.CONS:- Came with a scratch on the corner... Shrugged it off but not a good start.- Gets very hot while playing games like Witcher 3, Cyberpunk, Skyrim, etc. Kind of turns me off from playing games for long... but it does force me to be more productive. I've tried risers, cooling pads, both, and laptop alone. Nothing helps. I believe cooling the laptop does have an effect but the performance will just increase to keep it at the high temps. You cannot reduce the target temps below 70. I would rather have less performance with longer life, keeping it at lower temps increases lifespan.- 16 GB Dual Channel (8+8) but it was Single Rank. Before purchasing there was no confirmation on if it was Single or Dual Rank memory. I would have preferred they could have given me a single channel 16 GB so I could add another one. But oh well.- ASUS Armoury and Aura software is more complex than it has to be... and has too many terms to agree to before you can use your laptop to the fullest.- Not 100% sure but I have heard from others that thunderbolt cannot be used to charge the laptop. Will confirm when I get a dock.- Bottom shell has zigzags.... why? Doesn't this add complexity for no benefits?- Bottom plastic shell was very soft. My iFixit ""guitar pick"" tool bent and scratched it and clips on this shell already broke. I did not force it more than normal.- Metal clips inside the case will bend very easily. Honestly I don't understand why there needs to be clips on the shell if you have screws anyways?- Sharp-ish edges?- Noisy Fan but there is a silent mode",0

"I had to return mine because I needed a larger internal drive for my computing purposes, but this laptop is a nice, lightweight, and tiny laptop for general use. I would recommend using an HDMI cable to use a larger screen, but it functions well without one.To clarify, I do a lot of work with 20gb+ files, and the internal drive was too small to handle the temp files. This laptop would be great with the addition of a 256gb sd card for additional storage because they aren't too expensive. Keep in mind though, as in my case, your internal drive(maybe 6-8gb free with windows installed) is what dictates your capabilities. If you're comfortable with modifying the registry, you could easily use the larger sd card as the main drive.",0

I have had this laptop for a month now and I'm absolutely enjoying the performance this beast laptop has to offer. This laptop has an RTX 3070 low wattage GPU and is more powerful than the RTX 3060 laptop in terms of cooling and performance. The laptop is very light but the only downside I ever felt with this laptop is its battery life. I hardly get around 4 hours in super battery saver mode. Other than that this is a great laptop and will suggest everyone to just go for it without any hesitation.,0
"Bought this pc with the intent of installing a lightweight linux distro on it. When I received it, I spent 10 min playing around on it and found windows 10 to be slow. After some research, I installed Ubuntu Mate on it and it works like a peach! After installation there was about 20 Gb of free space and all the functions worked (bluetooth, web cam, hdmi port, ect.) . Its a lightweight distro that still carries alot of functions. However, do you research and install at own risk. Might not work/be for everyone.",0

"Laptop was working perfectly until, after two weeks, it simply died after playing a very non demanding game, kerbal space program. Temperatures were normal and the computer just randomly crashed and then could never post.In order to attempt to fix this on my own I went to take out the battery for 10 seconds. However, the battery casing is very poorly design--its placed inside the case!! Its not like the hp laptops where you can just swap it out easily by pushing a button. No, you have to remove a good 12 screws and take off the bottom panel just to remove the battery. I also sliced open my finger trying to undo all of the annoying latches without breaking the flimsy bottom panel. Oh, and by the way, it took me 10 minutes to realize that there was another screw hidden under the dumb factory seal label!!!! Very annoying and frustrating since it was very stealthily hidden. Lastly, you'll want to make sure you're very gentle when removing the case because it would be very easy to break off the little plastic latches that snap the bottom panel on.Currently put a support ticket into MSI and fortunately I'm within warranty, so I will update this depending on their responsiveness and ability to get my laptop working.So far im very disappointed, but I understand that electronics sometimes have flaws because of the laws of probability, and it may have actually been nvidia's or intel's fault, so I will revert this to 4 stars if MSI solves my problem. It would be 5 stars if the battery wasn't behind the bottom panel.UPDATE:MSI's RMA process was excellent. They did a very professional repair, it looks brand new and runs well. I was worried that they might mess up the thermal paste after putting in a new mobo, but it appears. Apparently there was a crack in the chassis that I did not even know about and they replaced and fixed it to without me even mentioning it! They've done right by me and I am impressed. I would give this 5 stars, but its not quite perfect due to the fact that the battery is on the inside and you have to remove 12 screws to get to hit. Besides that however this is an excellent product. I'll update if this dies again but MSI RMA service was fast and beyond expectation. Including shipping, receiving, them having to get new parts, and them fix it, it only took 2 weeks, and they rushed it so that I could get it before my trip. You won't be dissatisfied with the RMA service if you need it, so you can probably trust that MSI will do right by you. Thumbs up MSI. Killer deal for 899.",0

"I am really pleased with this purchase! The i5-9300H & NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 in conjunction with NVMe SSD makes for a very fast boot and snappy overall performance. I was VERY pleased to see that this contains a Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) network card in addition to a traditional gigabit wired Ethernet port. The backlit keyboard is a very nice feature, particularly when using this in low-light situations such as on an airplane. For being a thin and light laptop, I was pleasantly surprised to see all the ports on it (USB 3.1 Type-C, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0, RJ45, etc.).I use this for general computing in a mix of personal and business use. The performance has been top-notch and on par with my expensive Dell tower PC at work. The speakers are notably nicer (louder and clearer) than my previous Acer laptop.If you are in the market for a reasonably priced 15.6” laptop, look no further. This is a great buy!!",0

"This is actually a little speed demon entry level laptop. Technology has brought us to a point where laptops in the sub-$500 range are actually fast (once you remove all the crappy bloatware HP pre-installs). We have SSDs to thank for this, and even though the 128GB SSD in this laptop is small capacity-wise, it is fast and can be upgraded if you wish. SSDs also stay quiet and cool.The other parts of this machine are very entry-level for today's market, but that's okay given its place in the HP hierarchy. The screen is 720P, the body feels like a cheap laptop, but overall it's usable and a great option for a student (high school or younger, would recommend better for college), as a portable get-things-done-but-have-a-strong-computer-at-home type situation, or a primary PC for someone who merely checks email, shops, pays bills, and peruses social media feeds. Anyone relying on their machine for a living or getting through college ought to consider buying more computer. Anyone who wants to play games should definitely spend more.That said, it can multi-task really well. I can run Virtual DJ while browser tabs are open to buy new tracks at a gig on the fly. That isn't a huge workload, but it's important to know a laptop at this price 5+ years ago would absolutely struggle with it with the older HDD setups.Why the low rating? Well, for $489, this is an absolutely horrible deal. First, it is three generations old now. It has a very small SSD capacity and only 8GB of RAM. 720P and not full HD 1080P screen. Onboard graphics. There is absolutely nothing about this laptop worth $500.HP beats itself with the same $400 model ($430 for the touch model), current gen, 256GB NVME!!! SSD (faster than SATA SSD model like in this reviewed laptop), brand new generation of Core i3. I am not sure why this reviewed laptop is not $300 or so now. That's what it's worth. Thank you!",0

I purchased this because it met my budget and I honestly wasn't expecting anything great because of the price but I am thrilled! I'm able to play WOW Shadowlands on high settings (I haven't tried it on Ultra but I wouldn't count it out). I'm adding some extra ram and will eventually expand the SSD.

I thought that Lenovo had embraced Linux after hearing some devices would be preinstalled with Fedora however they still have some ways to go.

"When I first got this laptop, it was everything that I had asked and hoped for. It ran quickly, booted fast, ran the games that I needed it to, took the notes that I needed, the whole nine. It was perfect for what I was doing as a college student. I had it for eight total months before it started to get louder. Then nine before I started receiving messages that the fan was malfunctioning. I took it to my school's IT place and they said it looked like a screw was missing that was holding the fan in place. I don't know anything about it or if the screw was even there since I'm too scared to open up my own laptop. I don't know how to do this stuff and I wasn't going to mess it up more. They cleaned the fan, but they couldn't fix the loud clicking and whirring noise coming from the fan. Now a little further down the line almost 1 year and it's shutting down randomly, taking forever to start up, freezing, won't stay on if it's not connected to a power source, and the clicking is constant and makes it difficult to use the laptop. I can't even take it with me to class anymore to take notes because of it. I won't say not to buy it, because I loved my laptop in the beginning, but be warned that, even brand new, you're probably going to have to replace it within a year or two. However, if you don't just have 600 dollars to burn on a laptop, then pick something else or invest in the warranty. You're going to need it.",0

NOT A HAPPY CAMPER! We purchased this for our college bound daughter. It was supposed to be a touch screen. It wasn't. Returned and for my $$'s back,0
"This laptop was everything I had hoped for and it is incredibly packed with features for anywhere near the price. Since I'm a Prime member, it arrived in two days flat. Nice! The packaging and shipping was excellent, the laptop box itself is packed in its slim cardboard packing with a perfect fit and then packed in an outer box as well. Absolutely no damage, dents or bruises at all. AC Adapter and minimal documentation included (no media). There's really nothing else needed, it appears to have one of the newer kinds of battery that's internal and not user changeable, and it charges well. On the initial screens you can choose to turn OFF all the slide controls that offer to send info to Microsoft. (recommended).One thing you have to be prepared for due to Windows 10, is that as soon as you reach the place where you give it whatever means of internet connection you use - it takes over and begins the update cycle. The large 3GB Windows 10 ver 1709 takes some patience, so just let it do it's thing and give it as much as several hours. You want to make sure that it's all up to date first before you go in and tweek things. So don't begin that process until you can spare several hours, and you'll be in good shape.It came with what I'd call minimal bloatware. Some folks want that stuff, I did not. I uninstalled xbox gaming, MS Store, an eBay shortcut and several other items I had no use for. The 30-day eval of MS Office wasn't going to do me any good so I uninstalled that as well. Less than 10 minutes lost to cleanup - no problem. Looking at the add/remove programs listing in the Control Panel, you can see it comes with the usual nice collection of Acer utilities, so don't remove those. And when you do finish the installation and have it configured just the way you want, take the time to do a Windows Image backup to an external USB drive, along with a Restore DVD, that's your very best means of recovery later on if you ever crash your drive.This is a very well-made laptop and the best by far of any of the several former Acer laptops I've owned in the past. Sturdy, powerful, loaded with all the latest and fastest ports, (you have to love the 802.11ac WiFi, it's a screamer) - along with a 1TB drive, plenty of RAM and expandable to a whopping 32GB - it's a great buy and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone wanting high performance in a low-cost package. Everyone has their preferences, true - but I give this model 5 stars for Amazon's packing, shipping, and Acer's very best product line yet. And I'm an IT Professional of some 24 years, so I get my hands on some very top-dollar laptops for business. I think you'll be pleased with this one!",0
I liked how the keyboard is and how fast the laptop is for gaming I would highly recommend it for people how have money to buy it.,0

"This 17 inch Envy laptop is great for school. The Full HD Touchscreen on this laptop looks amazing and with a high screen resolution, there's enough onscreen room to work with. This Envy laptop is speedy and logging in with Windows Hello is awesome, just look at the camera and you're in. The backlit keyboard is cool too. Overall, a great built laptop that will handle tasks well.",0

"I bought this just for cruising the internet, and it works great-it’s fast loading pages and has a great quality screen. It is very compact and light weight. I had a old Apple notebook that I was never happy w/ operating, but this is quite a good change of pace.",0
Tengo problema con la confección al internet ya que no puedo a travez del WiFi. Tengo que conectarla con un cable. Estoy tratando de comunicarme con él vendedor.,0
It has the best processor you can practically get in a laptop right now and has plenty of ram to go with it!,0
Looks sleek and nice. So far seems really good for the price. Wifi is fast and the screen quality is really nice. If you plan to use it for comp gaming buy a mouse.,0
Three weeks and the wireless no longer works says to connect an ethernet cable instead; however there's no jack on the computer for one. I won't buy another HP.,0
"So I worked at Best Buy for like a year as a computer sales rep. It was my job to figure out what machine worked to who based on the things they wanted to achieve.Having this laptop about a week in, I have to say this little thing is amazing. It has its response issues, it's a Celeron. I didn't say it could do anything. You won't game or edit videos, you'll struggle using photoshop or even playing Minecraft I'm sure. But everyone could make use of a laptop like this. It's small, light, quick, the trackpad and keyboard are high quality (what you would expect from Asus).No one doesn't browse the internet or type things out, and for those things it's perfect. Paired with the ability to upgrade the storage indefinitely with a micro SD card or use cloud storage? Super powerful machine for the price. For comparison, I also have a $1,500 ROG from 2018 and a MacBook Pro with the TouchBar, I have a few desktops, and ultimately I can still find use from this little guy.10/10 would buy again. Actually, I might too.",0

This was my first huge expenditures in my life. I am sure it was worth it. Never regret. I am not paid to write a review. This is legit 100% personal opinionated review. RGB lighting is awesome, also I know that some of Asus or ROG laptops have low sound volume even though it is maximum. I tested with my new laptop, it loud, crystal clear, and crisp with dolby atmos technology. Almost, every game in the gaming market, you can play with maximum graphic setting. By the way, this is my first review in Amazon. Hope it helps.",0
"My first review was to return it but since it was good for value, I decided to keep it. However the laptop is heating a lot, I fear it will burn out because the CPU temperatures go quite high and very noisy. The cooling is not enough, you can't even touch the upper side of the keyboard because of heat. I fear it might malfunction soon because of melting of some pieces inside. I just play total war by the way so it's not super high graphic needs, if I play a FPS I think the computer will burn. So, overall good speed and graphics but bad sound, bad keyboard lights and extremely bad cooling.",0
"The laptop can run small programs like chrome, YouTube, Netflix, etc. But it can not run big games. Mine doesn't even lock when I close the screen and the fan can be very loud and it sounds like the radioactive detecting sound. I would not recommend because the graphics card is what kills the performance and so does the bad motherboard.",0
"I have an ""old"" 2018 model. But this one is one step forward than that. It is more compact yet you feel it is bigger. Excellent screen and touch pad. Happy with this purchase.",0
"This is a great laptop, I first ordered an ASUS Tuf and returned it due to it not starting up. After further research, I decided to spend the extra few hundred dollars on this laptop. Out of the box, downloaded games such as Call of Duty, Fortnite, Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege and all work excellent. I bought a hard wire for the internet thinking I would need it to prevent lag for gaming, but have not once needed to connect the cable and the cable is still in its box....................ONE THING: I do want to point out is that this laptop will get HOT fast for gaming. It does have the turbo fan, which is much needed, and the turbo helps cool down the laptop, but the turbo feature is loud. I just recently ordered a fan pad and still waiting for that to come in. The only suggestion is if you order this laptop (GREAT LAPTOP AND FAST) I would suggest ordering a cooling pad also. This way you can have it cooled down maybe more quietly without having to run the Turbo fan on the laptop. I have no regrets ordering this laptop. VERY, VERY PLEASED with its performance and would recommend to anyone looking to game. I bought the 512Gb for the extra space. I hope this laptop lasts me a while cause it is AWESOME!!!",0
Great laptop.,0
Started having issues starting it up after using a handful of times. It completely stopped working within a month,0
Bought for my hubby. He likes it and says it is fast!,0
it got so hot that the charger port melted.,0

Paid $10 more than the original Acer Chromebook I bought years ago. 10 times better.,0

Best choice overall for the average user.,0
"This laptop is an absolute steal whatever game I throw at it it handles no problem, the most taxed I could get it was when I was playing 7 days to die on the highest I get a good 55-70 fps but my cpu temps on a black flat wood desk is 90° which makes me uncomfortable but with the back of the laptop proped up with a piece of wood and some adjustments to the fans it maxes out at 85°c I would recommend a fan stand but for other games it hovers around 80° which is fine for the cpu everything else about the laptop is fantastic well I can't actually review it as a laptop as it barley leaves my desk so the weight doesn't really matter to me but over all this laptop is a great steal",0
THE TOUCHPAD IS BAD!,0
"This computer works with everything I throw at it gaming-wise. My only real issues with it are the battery life and how it acts on the battery. Games sputter when on the battery, even games that don't need much resources like Rogue Legacy. I also added an extra 1tb m.2 drive and another 8gb of RAM",0
the power button is a little bit too easy to press,0

I like the touchscreen.,0

"It is a very solid gaming laptop, very good thermal, fan is not loud even on turbo, you can turn it to balance or silent mode without heating the laptop. The screen is the best, RGB is great but you can completely turn it off to avoid having that bad gamer impression.",0
"Absolutely perfect laptop for the price. It already has great cooling but I have the laptop on a Thermaltake RGB cooler for good measure and airflow. The predator software for thermal monitoring is excellent and you can customize how fast the fans go. I was able to install a 1TB SSD and another 1 TB NVME SSD for games. Be warned that by doing this you're potentially voiding the warranty, so make sure you're grounded and have the correct tools if you choose this route. The keyboard is okay, I ended up buying a Razer Hunstman TE so I rarely use the laptop keyboard. Overall I would not sleep on this laptop I'm very happy for buying it and I think every gamer would as well.",0
"Purchased the laptop new from Amazon and received with a faulty power adapter (barrel plug is malformed). Immediately registered on Acer's website, followed their service request process to file a claim and began setting up the laptop. Had a full charge on the battery so I spent several hours on setting up the laptop, expecting that getting a replacement power adapter would be no big deal. Online chat to contact Acer support is completely offline for days at this time.Several days later, I receive an automated email that Acer is unable to complete my request for repair and that my next course of action is to contact the reseller. Should return the laptop to Amazon, undoing hours of work setting it up and maybe getting a replacement? Shame on Acer for complicating getting a working power adapter. At this point I'm ordering a replacement A/C adapter and remembering the poor warranty support experience before purchasing more Acer equipment.",0
As a college student I love it. Good speakers. Long battery. Fast. Easy to work. Good keyboard. I know this is standard now but I love the night light mode. Light weight. Worth the price.,0
"Mi novia está feliz con su laptop, está encantada con lo ligera y rápida que es, así que la recomiendo mucho",0
I have been in love with this beautiful computer since I got it... And the only real downsides are no cd port and has little memory on the hard drive... I got an external one and now it's been going fantastic!!! Because I have no problems with this... Although sometimes I wish it had a CD port so I could watch some of my old DVDs on it... But seriously if you want a good gaming laptop this one is great.,0
It works.,0
"It has a nice look, it is light but solid, has full size keyboard with a good feeling when typing.",0
"Laptop is great for the purpose for which I purchased it. Starts up quickly. Battery life seems adequate so far. Don't set your expectations high on screen quality with this machine. Resolution makes a difference, so just keep this in mind when evaluating your options. Overall, nice machine for the price.",0
Microsoft store doesn't work . apps don't work . couldn't switch out of s mode . couldn't reinstall from an outside device . called Microsoft and Asus support they don't know how to help . very bad software installed makes the device worthless . too bad,0
"This was purchased to replace an old portable what was still running Windows Vista - so you know that then I say old - I meant it. Anyway setup was easy - made so by the walk through instruction screens that came up immediately upon turning it on. The screen is large and bright - and it shows BluRay videos without any problems. The fingerprint reader is hit 80% of the time and miss the rest of the time - but no biggy. My only other slight complaint, is the off/on button is a little harder to press than any other system I have had - but again a minor complaint. So yes, I would recommend this system to anyone who would like a very light and portable computer.",0
If AORUS offers two AC adapters to end user will be fantastic!!,0
It's a wonderful Laptop.,0
Good fast laptop,0
"I bought this to replace a 7 year old Linux gaming computer (dual-boot, multi-drive) with a corroded power supply, expecting to install a couple extra hard drives, while still playing a few games on the original Windows drive it shipped with. After a little research, it looked like I wouldn't have a lot of trouble installing drivers for the hardware that comes with this model, and the price was reasonably low compared with System76, so I went ahead and ordered it.BIOS and hardware upgrades: Once the 2nd drive I ordered arrived (separate packages, couple days later), I proceeded to install the 1 TB drive along with the 500 GB drive from my old system, using the upgrade kit which came with this computer. Taking apart the computer was fairly straightforward, but because Linux requires you to disable Secure Boot, I proceeded into the BIOS to enable booting from USB and turn off Secure Boot and UEFI. The BIOS password was NOT set, and I was allowed to add one of my own, but all the settings related to security and boot order were still greyed out. Despite installing 2 additional drives, and being allowed to set a password for one of them, I was not allowed to boot from anything except the 500 GB drive this computer shipped with or any kind of external media.I called the support number in the pamphlet that came with the computer, and asked about this, but was told that Acer locks the BIOS on all computers shipped through Amazon in order to ""protect"" customers from changing things that might break the computer if they don't know what they're doing. He explained that all computer vendors do this to one extent to another, such as Apple with iPhones, and refused to provide me any means to unlock it no matter how technical I am. He continued that if I want to upgrade anything, I should call Acer's main customer service line and order it from them, instead of trying to modify it myself. At this point, I demanded a refund because the item was materially different from what was advertised, and effectively unusable for my purposes as a result, but he refused because the package was already opened. I pointed out the product description did not list the BIOS being locked, and based on forum postings about this model on Acer's website, locking the BIOS did not appear to be a standard configuration for this model, but he stated that's what Acer wanted for Amazon-shipped computers, and that they're under no obligation to disclose this information prior to purchase, so I replied I will simply complain to Amazon and seek a refund through them. I did try contacting Acer's customer support number listed on Amazon, and on their own website; after a few days of trying, I did eventually reach someone (average wait time of 60 minutes), who ultimately confirmed Acer intends to limit customers' ability to change boot sequence for their ""protection"".Keyboard: This was a real nuisance. The 1 key, Q key, Z key, and I think a couple others make a distinct ""clicking"" noise when I press them, sometimes don't press in properly, and feel like they will pop out or otherwise break within about a month or so of use. It also has some weird light-up pattern that runs from left to right and flickers a bit as soon as it lights up. Almost looks like something is wrong, and might burn out in a few months.Battery life: While waiting for the 2nd hard drive to arrive, I played Elder Scrolls Online over Wifi a little bit. Computer was fast enough to handle it, but the battery died within about an hour, despite being brand new. Given how batteries decline over time, I worry about how it will perform after a few years.Screen quality: Says it's 1920x1080, but looks a little pixelated, which is kind of weird. I don't know how to describe it, but the pixels look a little larger than I'd expect, and the computer defaulted to a lower resolution out of the box for some reason. Nothing too special or standout-ish, I've seen better, but also not terrible.",0
"Mis requerimientos son menores, si que la laptop trabaja de maravilla.",0

"Beautiful and fast, I don’t give 5 stars because it turned off by itself two times. I assume the laptop was doing that because of updates, but I didn’t receive any notification like the other times. I hope it doesn’t happen again.",0
"I believe this product would have served my purpose had I had a cell phone to receive the verification code. Not having one I tried the other suggested methods they said, and it didn't recognize my email or home phone . Hence without a cell phone don't buy this product.

"Después de usaras por un mes. ME A ENCANTADO la uso para jugar league of legends y corre a 220 fps a 240 fps, otros juegos actuales como its take two que pide autos requisitos, corre super fluido sin bajones de fps ni nada, pienso descargar elden ring. La bateria se descargar lentamente mientras juegas un juego que pide los maximos requisitos cuando jugaba its take two la lapto estaba toda cargador y se descargarba de forma pasivo, aunque eso no baja su rendimiento en el juego. Jugu como 6 horas y solo se descargar como un 20%. Algo que note es que una vez la use y estaba a 95% la bateria la conecte por que hiba a jugar lol para que no se descargara y no se cargaba se quedo en 95% note que la bateria solo se cargaba cuando estaba en 90 o menos nose a que se deba eso. En resumen es increíble super ligera, con mucha capacidad, solo que no tiene tanto espacio pero se arregla con una memoria usb, nunca se me a recalentado.Pd: para configurar la luz de la teclas o desactivarlas y ver otras configuraciones deben entrar en la aplicación Msi que viene por defecto en el menu de Windows",0
I bought the Chromebook because I was bringing my Mac to work and I was terrified it might get stolen as I work at a college. This little computer is Awesome and it was so inexpensive for what you get! Now I use it for most of my work tasks. I had no idea or I would have ordered this a year ago.,0
I honestly thought it will be bigger but I barely use it anyways. Good for writers and quick searching,0
"I do not regret buying it but to me having had it now for maybe 2 months and the white letters on the keyboard are beginning to already seem to fade away is not a good thing. I predict in another 6 months I would have to then add an external keyboard to this so I can use it and see the keys. HP you can do better than this, I expect this from an Acer not an HP.",0
"No complaints at all. Lightweight, fast, even after install several software including antivirus, firewall and updates drivers the performance of the laptop is the same.

"No annoying fan noise, just normal fan spin when the computer is under load.",0
"Bought for a friend. Runs very well, good build quality, everything as expected, excellent for the price. However, it came with a Canadian power adapter when there was no indication of which power adapter it would come with on the page.",0
Has been a great laptop so far! I have zero complaints about this laptop. its a must if youre tight on cash.,0
"I love this computer. Period. It has very fast web browsing, I even downloaded a few games and it worked great. I use this for gaming most of the time, It can run YouTube videos at 1080p without buffering, (with good internet connection) The bluetooth is good on it, connects to all the devices I have tried. And the screen is good???? I don't know what the other reviews are saying but the screen is not bad at all. Defiantly not the best, but not very noticeable at all. Also, with the new Windows 11 update, with windows insider program was able to get windows 11 no problem. Thanks for reading this review, I recommend the computer 10/10.",0

"Desde el UNBOXING descubrí que tiene muy buena ventilación y con muy buena calidad en sus disipadores.Lo uso para videojuegos y Realidad Virtual con OCULUS QUEST 2 con experiencias que desarrollamos con muy alta calidad y el computador se comporta fenomenal. Con lo cual hemos podido desarrollar con mayor capacidad y calidad en sus gráficos.La batería para labores administrativas con herramientas básicas puede durar entre 3 ó 4 horas. Para videojuegos y realidad virtual siempre es mejor usarlo con la corriente conectada.El sonido es bueno, la pantalla de excelente calidad, es un equipo liviano entre los equipos de trabajo pesado.Tiene 3 puertos USB + 1 Puerto USB Tipo C, creo que apenas es.En lo personal me ha gustado mucho; he tenido diferentes marcas de computadores GAMER y con este me siento feliz y confiado. Lo recomiendo 10 de 10.",0
DO NOT BUY THIS CHROMEBOOK! I just bought it and when I turned it on it had someone else's login information on it and he was listed as the owner?

Purchased brand new. Inexplicably turns off by itself while on a full charge and plugged in. There's also a fun bug in Windows 11 that turns off the wifi by itself and won't let you turn it back unless you do a full power-down (I've run all Windows updates). Restarting the computer doesn't fix the issue. Pretty bummed out that I've only had this a few months and it's a complete lemon. Not sure I've had such a frustrating experience with a piece of technology before.,0
Windows conflicts with the laptop consider changing it to windows 10 and maybe upgrading the network card as it isn't that great otherwise very good machine,0
It was a gift; the person is very satisfied.,0
Good quality. Good for entry level to mid level gaming laptop. Able to run Gears of War 5 without any issues.,0
"I do not use it often but when I do need it I am forced to sit through downloads (can't do much else with it using all its processor speed for that) then, when THAT'S done I have to wait out the restarts and installations of the ""new"" stuff.Perhaps I am just getting old and grumpy but I do not remember my previous laptops being so needy.",0
"The laptop started breaking one month after the eligible date for return. The key pads are falling off, and the other day the display was just broken out of nowhere (meaning, it was working ok in the evening but when opened in the morning the display was cracked and with strange colors - it happened without the laptop being moved or mistreated).",0
"I was a bit worried recieving a used laptop or something wrong with it but it came thru and its actually brand new! Sooo cool and soo powerful, & if anything does happen to it luckily I'm pretty DIY savy when it comes to tech but none the less it's brand new and works excellent. This thing is a beast!",0
"I bought this product because of the brand new description, but the didn't come in its original box and even the charger is an off brand. The laptop is not touch screen.

"Computer is fine but it is a challenge to have anything on it because of its small hard drive space. In fact windows is completely unable to update at this point if you have anything more than a web browser on it. It has 64GB of space on it, 32 GB (and growing) is used by windows, and another 8-16 GB of that is used by windows updates. Only buy if you are desperate or are in need of an oversized web browser.",0
Great as described,0
"very nice, my first chromebook always had a laptop pc,but this works for me just great,price is good as well",0
"One year update.I bought this to replace my dinosaur Asus N53SV on a budget. After 5 years, it was still playing the latest demanding games without complaining, and the only problem being a dead battery, I decided to stick with Asus and see if their Zenbooks held up just as well.Long story short, yes. Expectations exceeded.The first thing I noticed out of the box was the quality. The aluminum body is sleek and beautiful and just puts the Macbook Air to shame, IMO. It's incredibly light and just the right size to fit on your lap. And even considering that, it's surprisingly durable. This thing has taken two or three major falls (including one where it was dropped 4 feet onto tile, hit in the corner hard enough to totally bend the metal) and keeps on going like nothing happened.The keyboard is a huge improvement over the one on my old Asus laptop; it takes little effort to type and has a satisfying click. The adjustable backlight is a great bonus.The touchpad, on the other hand, is another story. This is one of the few criticisms I can even make about it, but it can make the laptop a little frustrating to use at first. It took me months to understand just where to touch to use the right-click function, and spent some time annoyed when I'd try to open a link in a new window just to end up clicking on it instead. Once I adjusted to this, it was fine, but it took longer than it should have.My only other gripe is the screen. The matte finish is lovely and the wide viewing angle has come in handy far more often than I thought it would. However, the subtleties in darker tones tend to get lost...pictures of my black cat look more like a silhouette. It's not bad in most situations if I turn the brightness all the way up, but it can make editing pictures a little less accurate.Where this laptop really impressed me is performance. My old Asus was a quad-core i7 with a good dedicated graphics card, and the UX330 slaps the crap out of it (until you really push it with graphics). I can go from opening the laptop to being on the desktop and ready to go within 10 seconds. It's responsive like a sports car and doesn't hesitate to do what you ask. It multitasks like a champ. I was worried that the integrated graphics meant no more games for me, but it hardly even stutters when playing The Sims 3 on a huge open world.Honestly, my only regret is not saving a little more so I could buy an even better Zenbook. But for $750, I almost feel like I stole this laptop.",0
Excellent gaming laptop and definitely worth the price.,0
"The battery life, the option to disable the touch pad with the mouse attached, the cam cover & internet speed and connectivity are great - especially for the price!",0
"All I use it for is school and 9/10 it kicks me out and I have to use my phone to do my school work, pretty pissed I spent so much on something so pointless",0

"I bought a 15 inch E595 for my wife back about a year ago (late 2019) with the Ryzen 5 to replace a T430. While the feel is more mid-range then the T430 we could not have been happier with it. I also am responsible for purchasing for the company I work for and we needed laptops, really wanted something with 8 threads and graphics drivers that played nice with linux out of the box. We looked at some dell options but at the time these where 500 bucks and fit the bill. 13 laptops later, they have become beloved at the company.",0
I use this for work it is excellent. It does what I needed to do and it does it fast,0
good performance for the price,0
"So first off this is a great laptop! For most people, you won't go wrong with this laptop. This laptop will preform great at whatever you need it to do. I bought this laptop primarily for gaming, and that's where this laptop has a few drawbacks. The biggest problem with the laptop I bought is the graphics card. I bought the 3050 ti 4gb v ram version, and the 4gb v ram is the problem. Right now I can play basically any game out of the box. The setting will very alot though. Most games are running from high to medium settings, their were a few that were stuck at low settings. 4gb v ram is fine for now but it is not future proof, mabey in a few years you will have to upgrade to a whole other laptop. Outside of that this thing runs games cool. It dose not get hot for me at all. Some issues with brightness on a few titles, their just to dark when in shadow areas idk if its the screen or my settings I've tried changing the settings but not much improved in the few titles. Overall I do recommend this laptop for gaming just be aware of the vram. I am very happy with this laptop.",0
The best purchase in terms of computers. Sometimes it is a little noisy but the battery life and the light weight combined with it's practicality make it a wonderful choice.,0
"Cheaply made. Screen got a crack on it even with careful handling. Screen then wouldn't stop flickering. I had to buy a separate monitor which worked well for a little bit, but now there's something wrong with the HDMI port. The cable feels loose and the pins (or whatever it is that makes contact these days) constantly lose contact causing my portable monitor to flicker and turn on/off if I shift the laptop even slightly. Bottom lid also started bulging out to the point where I can't completely screw it shut, so some of the internal parts exposed. I've only had this laptop a few months. Never dropped or mishandled. Never buying Lenovo again",0
this is so versatile that I found myself using the touch screen and voice instructions frequently,0
Good little laptop for the money. Screen is clear and bright. The brushed chrome is a little rough. Wish the battery life was longer. Good buy.,0
No idea yet. It's hour four of updates. I hooked it to a cat 5 cable 4 hours ago as I thought it might be my wifi. This is ridiculous. I am at 49% of updates.,0
Got it at 1199USD. Hhhhh,0
Lovely laptop. Does the job well.,0
Perfect for the price,0
"It's fast, great for all around use like gaming and school work. The speakers sound nice for Netflix for example. Solid state drive is the way to go. Turns on in seconds.",0
Buen provecho,0
I never owned a Macbook so I was a little apprehensive. Turns out that was for nothing. This is easily the best laptop I've ever owned!,0
The 128gb ssd feels rather useles(on bigger titles) and would preferred paying 100 usd more for a 500gb ssd instead.,0
"well the headline says it all! Very clean and responsive laptop! Light weight for its size, and powerful! Heavily used for Office365 (separate software purchase) and PDF writer/creator so RAM was important. Screen is really nice, easily work though thousand line spreadsheets, crisp web graphics and in the end plays games and has no refresh rate issues! All in all a well rounded laptop well worth every penny! Love the lit keyboard, the on board mouse is really quite handy. Some others are just terrible to use, not this one! I switched it out of S Mode in 20 seconds so don't let that be a deciding factor! (just google it, its a free change/update)Simply put, go ahead and buy this one. Its a really good buy!",0
Doesn't come with Windows 10 64bit cd key.,0
speakers crackle and have not been sounding good to me,0
Got this product through Donors choose for my students and they love it. Everyone wants to use it because it is touch screen.,0
"Bought this laptop on Oct. 3 2021, and got stuck in the bios Oct. 23, 2021. For the short amount of time that it was working, it was amazing and played all games at max flawlessly. The battery life is inconsistent to what is in the detail description. Battery life without gaming, and just web browsing/watching a movie was about 2-3 hours MAX. If gaming, it will probably last 30-45 mins MAX.",0
I purchased this laptop because it had over 4000 good reviews. Like really highly rated reviews. But other than the low price I did not see any good preforming features. Overall a normal laptop that is pretty thin and light and cheap being the best features.,0
It makes productivity apps like Excel and Onenote run without a flicker of disturbance and will run every game I have on high settings,0
"The laptop runs fine and games look great but there was something terribly terribly wrong with the graphics card. I would have it idle, sitting at the desktop but the graphics card would be running on full blast and running the battery down in less than 2 hours. I tried every single thing you could think of. Upgraded drivers, messed with every possible setting, called tech support. Three separate Lenovo technical support employees told me to just return it and that's what I'm doing right now. Save yourself a headache and just wait for the 1660ti version to be back in stock if it isn't already.",0
"Great computer; really enjoying it but I have one big issue- they claim you get 19.5 hours out of a charge. I don't know how you could get anywhere close to that with normal use. When I turn mine on and it's fully charged I get about ten hours, maybe eleven if I use it lightly- nowhere close to 19.5. That's hugely misleading, but otherwise it's a fantastic machine.",0
Iove laptop. Just as a warning I read two things before buying this laptop that don't appear to be true. First it says it uses a samsung m.2 hd and it came with hynix m.2. Not a deal breaker. Second it says it has a second m.2 slot but is a short socket version. It does not. Only found the 2.5 slot in which I used a 1tb samsung ssd. No deal breaker but I was alittle bummed. Otherwise this laptop is super smooth at play. The fans sound like allot of moving nair but no fan wine sounds. I will have to say this machine plays 2k @ 144 with zero ticks over three hour plus gaming.,0
"If your like me and you play a single game and that is Destiny 2 you most likely smashed your last laptop while doing a nightfall and getting error code anteater, but fear not, with this laptop and it’s killer Wi-Fi not even Luke Smith can come in and sunset your connection!",0
Very slow laptop. Hardly used for only 2 years and is now completely dead!! read the forums this is VERY COMMON!! total piece of junk I will never buy lenovo again!!!,0
it has poor shielding,0
"Quality product, works like a charm. Flexible convertible.Operates seamlessly, superior to mac or windows.Highly recommend.",0
"I normally would not write a review after less than a week of usage, but thus far this is the best of the seven or eight laptops I have owned. It is light, fast, and fully charges in less than two hours (I haven't paid attention to how long a charge lasts). The fingerprint recognition is working well for me. I am still amazed at how fast it boots up. Opening a browser seems almost instantaneous. It came with Windows 10, but I was easily able to upgrade to Windows 11. The only thing that I have discovered about Windows 11 that interests me is that I was able to sync it to my android phone. I am able to view and answer my text messages and it has a feature that allows you to make calls from your PC which I haven't tried yet. Right now I am really enjoying this PC, but If things go downhill I will provide an update.",0
"So i had this computer chromebook for a year now, and i got to say. This is a very good device! I been using it a lot and the keyboard is easy to use and the touch screen is amazing! The battery life can be work on a bit, but it does perfom very well with heavy usage. I don't like the touch pad very much, maybe it's just me but i feel like it lags just barely. I bough a logitech mouse so its not a big deal for me, but even when i'm not home, i simply navigate using the touch screen so it doesnt effect me. I'm hook with chromebooks, if one day i ever need another one, i know what i will be looking for.",0
We purchased this for my dad for Christmas. It is his first ever laptop. It's great for browsing the internet and playing solitaire on. He absolutely loves it! I would highly recommend this laptop for a first timer that just wants to browse the internet or read online books. it's not built for gaming at all.,0
I regret choosing this machine over the MacBook Air. The hinges are pretty weak in this. The laptop made some noise initially when I first opened the laptop but I ignored it. After using for a few months I noticed that the hinges are totally broken.,0
"I received a supposedly “certified refurbished” laptop that looked fine but had NO battery life at all. The second it was unplugged, it shut down, so it was completely useless. When I requested a refund, I was told they’d rather send me a replacement. I did not take that option for fear of getting the same kind of item. Then, after returning the item, my refund didn’t show for nearly two weeks. I contacted them and suddenly it appeared, so were they not going to honor the refund without me bugging them? Stay away—it was a terrible experience!",0
"Excellent laptop. It has enough ports and it is very tough. I use for programming, some video editing with after effects and Adobe premiere, and even some light gaming.",0
"This laptop is awesome for the price. I got mine with the NVIDIA GTX 1050, 8GB RAM, and 256 GB SSD. If you are looking for a windows equivalent of a Macbook, look no further! I will list the pro's and con's I have noticed while using this for the last few weeks.PROS:Amazing design does not look like a gaming laptop but is very powerfullThe fan is not super loud when under stress (ex: playing GTA V high settings)Barely gets hotCan run almost any games (Fortnite, PUBG, GTA V, CSGO, +)Awesome audio qualityLightweight and thinBattery charges super fastCONS:Screen is a tn panel with horrible viewing angles but is not the worsttrack pad can be laggy and when scrolling can be mistaken for pinch and zoomThe bezels around the screen are black although the rest of the laptop is silverBottom of the laptop is plastic, but that means it doesn't get super cold/hot when its on your lapOverall, this is an awesome laptop. I though that getting a GTX1050 would not work for me, but it is pushing through everything I throw at it so far. The keyboard is nothing special not bad, not awesome. I'm having no technical issues like random shutdowns or screen failures. I would 100% recommend this laptop to anybody looking for a great thin light gaming laptop (that doesn't look like one) for an amazing price.",0
"IT IS NICE, But the time kind of sucks",0
"Package arrived faster than the estimated arrival. The Chromebook was packaged well and we saw no defects (ours was used). The Intel sticker may have been hand placed, but who cares, right? The computer runs great. We ran World of Tank Blitz (using a game controller) and RoBlocks on the low Rez settings and experienced great appearance and ability to play.",0
The upper side of the keyboard is getting very hot.,0
I love this. I'm typing on mine right now. Works great. Bomb chromebook.,0
Yeah right off the box light bleading like in other reviews but not an issue for me easy to add one more nvme and ssd. Te battery in game mode is bad bit thats to be expected and yeas the turbo air is loud but again it does the job great,0

Awesome purchase!!!,0
"Slightly hard to find recommended upgrades (e.g. better battery / SSD or ram)When plugged to power, it is possible to play Cyberpunk 2077, Doom Eternal and other games on beautiful graphics and nice framerate.Generally I am very pleased.Only problem I discovered recently is something with the screen itself. It kinda shows only when the screen is black.small red and blue dots show... slightly noticeable but at least not too much",0
This is working as planned. No issues.,0
Best deal around and I don't need a laptop w/this. Especially love I have no software to update ! All done in the background.,0
"Se la compré a mi hermana y hasta me antojé yo de una. Yo soy estudiante de ingienería en software y pues todos los dias estamos en contacto con computadores y la mayoría de ellos Windows y distribuciones de Linux. Muchos de nosotros, como estudiantes de esta rama, tenemos una mala imagen de lo que es Apple como marca: que básicamente te venden la manzana mordida, pero al fin y al cabo todo esto son prejuicios. Al final me di cuenta que estaba equivocado. Una cosa segura es que te puedas comprar una PC con mejores especificaciones a este precio, pero la belleza y lo fino que son estas MacBook y el sistema operativo, hace que, aunque suene raro, las especificaciones queden un poco de lado. En fin. Súmamente feliz de este producto, es algo diferente a lo habitual, y había experimentarlo para poder juzgar. 10/10",0
no USB-C charging and a second power adapter is expensive,0
"I rarely hate a product. The Lenovo Flex laptop is that rare product. Two deal breakers for me: 1) the flex hinges are insufficient and the screen wobbles and jiggles and must be very strategically braced against something unmovable like a wall. 2) the lip on the edge of the computer casing that your keyboard fits into is sharp, abrasive and irritating to my wrists. It is higher than the surface so it scrapes and rubs on your wrists at all times. It is even irritating through my shirt and sweater let alone bare skin being scraped and abraised. Since this is not a warrant issue Lenovo does not stand behind my purchase. So, never again will I buy another Lenovo product.",0
Amazon is going down the hill. This item claims to have windows 10 but is actually chrome book. Do not buy.,0
"This is my third Asus gaming laptop and so far I love it. It seems to have all the power I expected of it and the aesthetics are a lovely upgrade for me. This is just my out-of-the-box impression, and I'll be putting it through the paces on some VR games soon so I may be updating this review soon!",0
Speakers are good quality for a laptop.,0
"El equipo llego con la caja da?ada, la caja de amazon llego intacta pero la de la computadora venia da?ada, la pantalla presentaba un defecto de visualizacion sobre todo en colores oscuros pero lo peor fue el desempe?o ya que el equipo llego infectado y con problemas de procesamiento.",0
Love it.,0
Screen has started to go black when I adjust it and I’ve only had this for a few months. Also it doesn’t connect to blue tooth products that connect just fine to my iPhone and tablet.,0
"This is a big laptop, which has pros and cons.+: the screen is really nice, videos and simple games look great on the big screen-: it's a little too big and heavy to use it in ""tablet mode""It's convertible, which seems cool, but 15.6 inches at 4.4 lb is really too big for a tablet. I do use it in ""tent mode"" to watch videos. It's easy to get fingerprints all over the screen though when you use it in touchscreen mode.The fingerprint reader is very convenient for logging in. It starts up quickly because of the SSD. Battery life is good. It's a great laptop for general usage.The one negative is that the screen came with some air bubbles in it. It's like a line of air bubbles near the bottom of the screen, and it's actually a very noticeable flaw on an otherwise high quality screen.",0
The 165Hz refresh is amazing. Runs mostly silently and fans noise isn't that noticeable when gaming. Stays cool and performs like a champ. Great Laptop!,0
"only had a week, but really like it. very easy to setup. bright screen with good color",0
If you want to waste your money and scream at a computer - then this is your computer. I waited a year to write a review to make sure it was the computer and not me. This computer is HORRIBLE. If I could I would go to HP and throw this paper weight into the lobby - the only proper way to return such a piece of garbage. This computer is so bad it makes Microsoft look bad.,0
Received the product right before Christmas for my elementary kid’s e-learning. Not even 2 months later devised has a major error message “Chrome OS” missing. Tried to follow steps to reinstall it - next error message due to severe security module not working. Called customer service for support only to end up with the run-arounds. All I want is an IT who can look and repair it. I would never again buy electronics with Amazon. In the store at least I can have customer care look at it and repair it. Very upsetting.,0
The Legion 5 is pretty powerful. It can run most games at recommended settings.,0
"We bought this for video editing and it has been amazing. Screen, CPU, GPU, and cooling have been great (considering my city's weather is very hot). Only big downside I have noticed is the poor battery life. Doing some file management and browsing only gives me around 2h. I activated hybrid mode and I think it improved, but haven't tested it enough to recommend it.It does not have an SD Card Reader, so I suggest buying the HooToo 7 in 1 Type C Hub that goes for around $20.Overall, great laptop. Will update this review in case I need to.",0
The laptop box arrived crushed on one side. The device was broken. I will never purchase electronics or tech devices online again.,0
LAPTOP WAS RECEIVED AND DOESNT TURN ON... COMPLETED FAIL,0
Perfection!!,0
"I switched to Chromebook a about three years ago. This is my second Chromebook and is a replacement for a Toshiba Chromebook 2 that was damaged. This thing does everything I need a laptop to do. It has long battery life. I can stuff it in a backpack and use it overnight without charging. I can watch several Netflix movies on it and still have juice left to check email and do other basic tasks. The screen is nice and bright. It isn't as sharp as my Macbook Air, but after you start using it you don't even notice. The keyboard is not bad. Again, after using it a little while you won't notice anything's different. I use the Google Drive for storage so very little gets stored on the laptop. But if you need more storage you can put in a cheap 32GB MicroSD card and you'll have plenty of space. About the only thing I haven't been able to do with the Chromebook has been editing photos. But, I recently got Snapseed on this machine and now I can edit just about any photo to my satisfaction.Overall, if you are like most people and just need a laptop for routine tasks like email, surging the web and viewing online media, this thing can't be beat for the cost.",0
The keyboard is generously sized and the keys have a nice solid feel,0
This chrombook words very nice .,0
"The laptop felt very premium, the keyboard was absolutely perfect in my opinion",0
Great computer for college. Small and effective. Short batter life though,0
As described,0
"Gorgeous, functional and very powerful laptop",0
I had the 2018 version of this laptop and i was skeptical on buying this version because the 2018 version had some awful thermals. After reading some reviews i decided to just go for it and it was totally worth it. This thing barely goes over 80 degrees and runs everything i play at high settings. Its a bit loud but at least it stays cool. The keyboard is great and the overall laptop looks and feels amazing. Highly recommend!,0
The absolute worst laptop I have ever owned. Non stop problems with this piece of junk. Absolute waste of time and money.,0
Where do I start? From day one after going through the typical BS updating setting things to the way I like things all the jazz. This pc has froze on me over a dozen times in 6 days. Literally can be anything looking through photos? Crash force shut down. Trying to edit videos? Crash force shut down. Trying to watch YouTube? Crash force shut down. Alienware command center updating? Crash force shut down. This thing is louder then a fighter jet taking off on the run way. This is the worse experience I have ever had with a 2000 dollar paper weight. Alienware claims they are the top in the industry what a joke of a claim that is. I wouldn’t recommend to is laptop to my worse enemy my iPhone 12 can process faster then this thing and it DOES NOT CRASH this thing is going back first thing tomorrow morning. Do your self a favor and get the newest iPad which can do everything this thing does but better absolutely unacceptableEDIT******Although everything I said previous was true but I believe I found the issue. After hours of research I noticed a reoccurring theme the alien ware command center I believe is what was causing all the issues I was having. I did a fresh reinstall of windows and did NOT reinstall the AWCC and since then I have not had any issues knock on wood. Honestly it’s a shame because the AWCC actually has very many cool features but if it’s going cause the rest of the applications I use to malfunction I will delete it 10/10 times. For such an expensive laptop by a company who claims to be the best In the industry the fact they can’t make an app that works as it’s suppose to is enough to make me not buy Alienware again. I will say this if you buy this laptop getting a cooling pad is essential. ALSO I will say I have downloaded WOW and it runs it flawlessly and it looks amazing. My only complaint is with the AWCC but this is a solid gaming laptop IMO for the price.,0

"As many before me have said, this is a terrific computer. I returned two computers with a faster processor and more RAM. They simply ran too hot and had fans come on quickly. This Asus has a very good processor and sufficient RAM, but it runs quietly with a solid battery life. It boots in less than 5 seconds for me, and it's speed isn't affected much by my VPN service and other processor chokers.Asus gives you some nice benefits, like the Audio Wizard 10 band equalizer. The backlit keys go off after a bit to conserve power. For the money, just an awesome product.",0
"This laptop gets hot quick when gaming, even after I bought a cooling pad, even had to get a new keyboard because playing on a hot keyboard got old quick, wish it had more fans and wish the fans were more powerful, other than that tho this laptop is pretty good, would recommend upgrading ram for it, slapped in some 32 gbs for this thing and works great now, good purchase over all",0
Speakers lack substantial volume.,0
La pantalla refleja y cansa usarla de día. La impresión de las teclas no contrasta y cuesta verlas de noche. El bluetooth con frecuencia tiene interferencia entre las bocinas BOSE que no tenía mi DELL anterior. No trae el conector para red alámbrica. Los primeros días estuvo lenta pero ahora ya agarró el paso (?Windows updates?),0
I gave this to my husband since his old laptop died. He really loves it!,0
"This is the slowest computer I've had since the 90s. Starts slow, runs slow, slow, slow, slow. I only use it for surfing and a few work documents, nothing big at all. It may take 5 minutes just to start. Locks up a lot. Should have known at this price, but it's not even worth trying at this very low price.",0
"For a used product It looks just like new, nothing to complain.At first the OS was kind of buggy but after a clean re-install the laptop becomes a rocket, extremally silence under normal use but in game mode is noisy, dual booting works perfect with linux pop OS,",0
"Lo que más me gustó es que es ligera en peso y las capacidades son suficientes para juegos nuevos. Es muy rápida y prácticamente no se calienta demasiado a menos que se use al límite o en lugares con altas temperaturas. Posiblemente quede a deber en algunas áreas como la duración de la batería o la RAM y a algunas personas les puede parecer que tiene poco espacio en disco duro. Para los gamers dedicados puede quedarse corta en rendimiento máximo pero en general cumple.Las mejoras disponibles son: mejor batería, espacio para otro SSD de 3.5 o un M.2, RAM hasta 32 GB (A pesar de los límites del fabricante de 16 GB, hay videos en línea que han probado con mayor capacidad).Para dise?adores o editores de video puede que requieran expandir el espacio de SSD.",0
"This is amazing laptop that has 16GB of RAM with 512GB of SSD space and Intel Quad-core CPU at unbelievable price. I love the 15.6"" large screen with 1080 HD IPS display that is bright and vibrant in color in many different angles. It also has large battery capacity that allows you to use the laptop for 8 to 10 hours when fully charged. It comes with the latest Microsoft Windows 11 Home edition installed and it will walk you through the setup when you first turn on the laptop. Please note that Windows 11 will force you to login with Microsoft account or you will have to create new account in order to finish the Windows 11 setup but after the setup is finished, you can go to the Control Panel setting to change it to local login if you don't want to log in with Microsoft account like I do. I really hate this feature but this is more of Microsoft Windows 11 feature and nothing to do with this laptop.WHAT I LIKE:[+] 16 GB of RAM, which is amazing and I would never get a laptop with less than 8GB but this one has twice as much memory compared to other similar laptops. More the memory, the faster the speed. It's simple as that.[+] Intel CPU with 4-core for multi-tasking, which also helps with performance along with 16GB memory.[+] 512FB of SSD disk space, which is more than enough for most people and can store massive volume of our family pictures and videos.[+] HDMI port along with Type-C USB port, which allows me to connect to 2 external monitors so I can work with 3 screens in total! This is one of my favorite feature!!![+] Amazing long battery life, good quality webcam, and large touchpad.[+] 15.6"" large screen with 1080 HD resolution and large keyboard with number pad.[+] 2 USB 3.0 ports as well as 1 USB 2.0 port, which is great as some wireless mouse works better with USB 2.0 port for their receiver.[+] Headphone jack, Ethernet port, and microSD card reader.[+] Very slim profile when closed and lightweight for ultra portability.[+] Amazing performance, speed, and value for its price!WHAT I DON'T LIKE:[-] Absolutely nothing.HOW IT CAN BE BETTER:> It would have been awesome if it had a biometric fingerprint reader so quick and secure login but this is not a deal breaker.BOTTOM LINE:I would give 10 out of 5 stars if I can. It's really hard to come by a laptop with 16GB of memory and this kind of specs especially at this price point. Very impressed with this laptop and so much room for even expansions in the future. The Type-C port can also be connected to USB-C hub for additional ports and input/output. Highly recommend this laptop without any reservation.",0
This is perhaps the best thin & light option out there right now.,0
superb,0
"I hate being that guy who only writes reviews when negative but this has become impossible to ignore. As a university student, I need my laptop functional and to do the simplest of tasks, have a working browser and stay on. Throughout my owenship of this device for over a year, it turns on and off frequently, at least one an hour, while working and thank goodness for auto save if not I would have a link for where I have smashed this laptop on youtube. This is a massive problem and I noticed only on most recent acer products. I have never had issues with laptops doing this before, and I work IT, which means it is linked to the hardware or some sensitivity that forces this to happen. Please, troubleshoot this issue as I now have to spend another $700 or more on a laptop now because there is no way I can make another semester with this migraine.",0
"2 months in and it suddenly went completely blank. No predator startup logo, no getting to bios, no booting from external media, no way in.",0
"I was very impressed with the MSI Leopard laptop. The 144hz screen is the best 15"" display I've ever seen on a laptop and it was able to handle all the games I threw at it with ease (Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Heroes of the Storm, World of Warcraft). It's also very light and comfortable to carry around.For the price, you're not going to get a better gaming laptop that's this portable.",0
"I initially planned on purchasing the Alienware m15 as I have bought gaming computers from Alienware for the last 15 years. However, after dealing with the worse customer service I ever experianced I decided to spend my money with another company and said goodbye to Dell.I ended up between the Razor Blade 15 and the MSI GS 65. One of the things that stood out to me was that even though many of the professional reviews ranked the Razor Blade as the better laptop many of them mentioned the GS 65 as a viable lower cost option with the same performance. A review of Amazon, Best Buy and other sellers revealed that the MSI 65 was higher ranked then the Razor Blade by people who purchased the laptops with the GS 65 having 4.5 stars and the Blade 3.5.The one point that people made against the GS 65 was that it was not constructed as well as the Blade. I agree with this, holding them side by side was almost enough to go with the Blade. However the heating issue with th Blade and the fact that I would be paying hundreds of dollars more for the same performance but a better case made me go with the GS 65.The GS 65 runs like a dream with a beautiful display. I have not experianced it getting too hot and it has run everything I have thrown at it on ultra settings. The one thing I did not like is that MSI partioned the 512 SSD hardrive. Plan on undoing this next week and adding a second SSD hardrive for extra storage.As far a the GS 65’s construction, after using the laptop I do not find it to be flimsy. It is lightweight and the material used for the case plays a large part in keeping the weight down. As long as you are not banging on the keyboard should not be an issue.",0

"The first day I got this computer, everything worked. 2nd day using it for work, the wifi symbol was gone and it looked to have no driver. Had to hard line into my router in order to work. Finally, the wifi symbol magically came back, and now, I can't plug my headset into the computer and head anything from it.. I just continue to hear it out of the speakers even though it puts a prompt up to accept using headphones.I am super super suuuuper irritated right now. This could make me lose my job. This needs to be replaced.. but I cannot go a day without a computer or else I will lose this job I just acquired. I currently do not have to be on the headset to take calls, but any day now I will have to be and cant.Also, this was supposed to be a Windows 10 computer and it is Windows 11. I really did not want to deal with all the bugs of a new OS.FIX THIS!",0
"On paper, it looks like a great laptop, and games do run as you would expect them to. But there are numerous issues that ruin the experience. First, and foremost, there is sleep. Dell has completely disabled it in favor of connected standby. So unless you shut your computer down, you are likely to pull the laptop out of your bag with a dead battery and the entire thing hot to the touch. This is unacceptable for a portable device. Additionally, battery life is mediocre, even for a gaming laptop, and the thermals are poorly designed. Even just browsing the web will leave this laptop too hot to sit in your laptop. And during gaming sessions, the fans will blow hot air right over your hands making the experience uncomfortable. Frankly there are are too many better options at this price point. I would suggest looking at those.",0

It has a great display, it opens easily with touch (fingerprint) ID, you can move easily from here to there and not lose any information. It is great for most purposes. The things I have had trouble with are the Apple word processing, spreadsheet or presentation programs, so I continue to use Office 365. That is not totally fair in this review as the device is wonderful!",0
Great model for the price. Does everything I want it to.,0
Trusted seller. Amazing product and I just love the laptop. I absolutely love it,0
So my first one broke. HP replaced it. Second one broke. My insurance replaced it. Third one is now broken. Do not buy this laptop. Same problem every time. The touch screen and volume stop working then the screen just goes black. THREE TIMES IN A ROW!!,0
"I was installing Discord, steam, some other non-game related applications TWO at a time and it was overheating the left side of my laptop HARD. I haven't even tried a game or several chrome tabs yet. This was all AFTER I updated Windows and Nvidia.Now we get to the gaming. Testing it with Baldur's Gate 3 and it automatically set it to ULTRA settings, minus DLSS, etc. The game is BEAUTIFUL (kinda running better than my gaming Desktop actually lol). But... just sitting at the main menu is 66 Celsius. (150F). CPU and GPU are pretty equivalent but CPU goes between 50-75C. You'd think that's fine, right? Well I had to use the loud as heck fan (Performance Mode) or it would hit 80C. Sitting at a somewhat avg of 71F in the tutorial area in the game and my keyboard is super warm to the touch. Especially the center. I am also kind of concerned for airflow since the bottom of the case is just... well let's just say bugs can get inside, or toothpicks, etc. No airflow... There is no proper covering for this. The 78C pic is when normal fan is going. 72 when Performance fan is going. This isn't even the big open world area in this game yet. If they fix the heating issue, honestly it's a 5 out of 5 stars. I think i'm going to need a cooling pad... As I am typing this, the center keys are really, really warm now. I do not think it is 71C in the center area of the motherboard.",0
Windows on these would not activate.,0
"Excellent screen quality, user friendly.",0
"Always wanted a sleek and light, relatively powerful (i7) laptop. The new Galaxy Book2 delivers on the former but is seriously lacking in the latter. The laptop has performed no better than my previous one, an Asus Vivobook, which has a now three-year-old i5 processor. Moreover, the TouchPad is glitchy and confuses two-finger commands for three-finger ones, although that may be a Windows 11 issue.Overall, I am disappointed and would not recommend this laptop at its current price point of $1,150. If thinness is not a priority, one can find a similarly performing machine for 30% less, I figure.EDIT: Between Samsung and Microsoft, this computer comes with about 80 apps running in the background. After uninstalling all the ones I'd never use, as well as disallowing almost any from running in the background, the computer is performing much more as expected.Edit 2: I'm now getting random black screens, and there are numerous other little bugs like the cursor appearing random places on the page while I'm in the middle of typing something.",0
"Looks great and does not have an overly aggressive ""gaming laptop"" design aside from the MSI logo.",0
"The input ports are very rough. I had a tough time plugging in a USB, HDMI or my 3.5mm into their relevant ports; really had to push it in there.",0
"Very fast page load and downloads. Frequent Google updates. Unfortunately, cannot download some programs like Turbo Tax; and, I wish it had a DVD slot.",0
First Dell for a few years and I just love the quality of the build. Amazing screen resolution. Bought 16GB or Ram and 1T hard drive. Lots of room to expand later up to 64GB of Ram and another hard drive slot if needed. I always try to 'future proof' my purchases and this fits the bill.Not the lightest machine around but a perfect size for photographic work - still highly portable but big enough to see my work.Like the keyboard and mouse pad and have had none of the issues others have mentioned.,0
"I got this computer one year ago for christmas, it's been amazing except for two giant flaws. The battery life is terrible, it won't last an hour just using google chrome, no games in the backround no nothing. The other major flaw is that it overheats a lot just playing fortnite cod or even sometimes just minecraft the cpu will get to 100 degrees celsius its crazy the computer will get so hot it will hurt to the touch. This is not very important but the speakers are pretty quiet. On the other hand the picture is great, games run really smoothly the graphics card is great it works really well. Except for the battery and the computer battery.",0
"First, Acer, why would you choose to mess with the established keyboard template? There is no ""end"" key. There is a ""search"" key where the caps lock key should be. And using tiny lowercase letters on an un-unbacklighted keyboard? WHY? I use the chrome browser so I was confident this would be what I needed for my mostly internet computer use. I did the research and asked questions and made sure I got the model with a card reader as I take lots of photos. After struggling and several chats, either the card reader does not work or no one is able to explain to me how to transfer my photos from the card to the computer. Amazon was kind enough to comp me an adapter which changed nothing. Still, no indication of how to get the pics from the card to the machine after the card is inserted and wipe the card afterward. So between my ancient, broken pinkie hitting the assinine ""search"" key and sending me to another plane of existence altogether, being unable to see the letters on the keyboard except at high noon in direct sunlight and not having whatever ""Intuition"" it takes to run an ""intuitive"" OS, this junk is going back to the company.I noticed very many ""refurbished"" Chromebook units for sale and now I think I know why. Will be happy to have my money back and end the frustration of trying to get help to run the thing. Good-Bye!",0
It is great as described. Not made for gaming. I don't really use touch screen.,0
"WIFI adapter stopped working just over 3 months of having this laptop. HP said since this is software issue, (and software warranty is just 3 months and hardware warranty is 1 year), I can pay ~$50 for them to help me fix this issue (for the first month).When I have taken it in to my university to have them fix it, they told me for some reason the laptop will not accept the new software from either HP or Intel website. Going to have to factory reset my laptop 3.5 weeks into a new laptop.",0
"EL EQUIPO SE AJUSTA A LO QUE ESTA EN LA PAGINA, EXCELENTE MAQUINA, MUY BUEN EQUIPO ..",0
"The laptop is good and what you would expect for $300, no complaints there. But the power connection is like a micro microphone connection and is very fragile. We have 3 of these laptops, purchased 4 months ago and all 3 have issues; one power connector broke in half.",0
Muy liviana,0
The RGB lighting looks amazing and it has some nice light show collections but I really wish there was a save and share option,0
"I really enjoyed this Chromebook and used it for nearly all my computer work. Last night I shut it off only to discover that it would not power on this morning. Having tried all the known methods to get it working again, I contacted Samsung and was referred to their licensed repair facility. It needs a new mother board - that plus the labor is twice the cost of the unit. I will purchase another Chromebook, though not from Samsung.",0
Very powerful. And great everything.,0
"El touchpad dejó de funcionar durante la primera semana de uso. En un inicio no daba problemas ni en Windows ni en Linux, pero investigando me di cuenta de que es un problema relativamente común con esa pieza.Lamentablemente es un producto de importación y si se hace la devolución el dinero que pagué por importación ($1500) se perdería, así que no me queda otra más que hacer la garantía válida.Otro problema que encontré es que la tarjeta de WiFi modelo MT7921 es muy nueva y no está soportada todavía en Linux. En el sitio del fabricante dice que desde el kernel 5.12 la soporta, pero yo probé hasta el 5.13 y nada.Fuera de esos detalles de hardware, el producto está muy bien y me parece buena relación calidad-precio.",0
"I needed a fairly basic laptop for just everyday usage like internet browsing, creating documents, printing, etc. My old Acer laptop had finally kicked the bucket after about 10 years of reliable daily usage. I have never owned a Dell computer before, but I was always turned off of their higher prices when the first desktop computers came out years ago. However, I figured that I'd give this one a whirl and see how it fared.To begin with, I wasn't looking for a computer that had super high-end specs for something like gaming. I just needed something that had a nice balanced level of specs that wouldn't get bogged down. This laptop has so far filled that need with a decent processor, memory, hard drive, display, etc. I haven't had any problems at all with the computer lagging or getting hung up while running multiple programs at once. This is something that I've experienced with all of my previous laptops at one point or another, but so far not with this one.The two areas that I felt were somewhat lacking for a laptop at this price point were the battery life and speakers. The battery life on this laptop is around four or five hours with basic browsing or document creation. I thought this could definitely be improved somewhat, but I guess it's still acceptable at this price. The speakers were also very weak and had a almost a tinny sound to them. I realize that laptop speakers are never going to sound great, but these were definitely a downgrade from my 10 year old laptop.Overall I have been fairly pleased with this laptop and it has so far suited my needs for everyday usage. The issues of the battery life and speakers are just minor issues and would definitely not be deal breakers for me, but there's definitely room for improvement. So if you're looking for a basic laptop to do some browsing, work, or maybe even a little streaming; then I think you'll be more than happy with this one by Dell.",0
Great laptop. Top rated for good reason.,0
Love it! My touch pad gets a little retarded sometimes and doesn't work but otherwise its great!,0
"Performance is on point for the specs, weight is light, battery life is okay but if you're playing games it should probably be plugged in, It runs somewhat loud and hot when the GPU is in use. I've only had a year of use so far.Biggest problem is the screen dimness, even at max brightness with dynamic adjustments settings turned off the screen cannot be viewed near a source of sunlight. Ideal for basement dwelling grokes with boarded up windows.Another huge issue, is that sometimes when returning from standby it blue screens and has to shut down. Maybe 1 in every 20 times especially if a lot is going on or a game is is running and you have to close it.",0
"So this review is EXTREMELY unfortunate to give ! I buy LOTS of products off amazon and over the years this is probably my 2nd review I’ve ever actually written . And I only do it because I feel obligated to warn people until ASUS pulls this product or gives a free extended warranty with it to ALL customers ! I love the look of this laptop and the build quality is great as far as materials used for screen and case , and I really love the look of it . It’s way nicer looking in person too ! I read a lot of bad reviews and took a gamble . I lost . This laptop is nothing but manufacturing defects in motherboard and software. Fans ran full blast 6700rpm right out the box , light keys didn’t work right either . And trust me I tried everything . Mine came down to a bad motherboard . I’m getting full refund so I’m at no loss , it’s just disappointing because I really loved the style of this laptop and wanted it to work out . Digging much much deeper into the issues , I have read COUNTLESS reviews of people having the same issues and worse . Seams to be mostly with these new models of ROG laptops . Clearly something went horribly wrong during manufacturing and they won’t admit it . Funny thing is , I read a review that was several months old saying “ ASUS told him they haven’t had any other complaints of this issue and they are surprised to hear about it “ and I was told the same thing by ASUS as well when I 1st called for help trying to fix the issues . I told him that’s funny because I am now reading reviews after reviews on line of people having the SAME problems . With no fix . Everyone being put through a long process of installing this and that and updating this and that , resetting the computer and doing it all again . Just to come to the same conclusion that the motherboard is bad and if I send it in they will change it out and send it back . Unfortunately I didn’t pay this much for a refurbished unit . I don’t want to bash ASUS as a whole , but it’s definitely not ok with this new ROG line in 2019 . I can’t speak for the scar 3 but personally , after this , I will not gamble on that now especially when I’d have to fork out another $500 or so for the 3 . One good thing I can say though all of this , is amazon is great at handling it and refunding everything or doing whatever I want to do to resolve it . A big reason I only buy PRIME products . It’s very rare I ever have a issue buying from amazon , but when I do they take care of me . I don’t mess around and wait to deal with the issue . Some people do and want to use the products for awhile defected and then try returning last minute and get a hassle sometimes because it’s then warn in some cases . Anyways , DONT BUY THIS ASUS PRODUCT . I’d advise to wait another year for them to work this issue out ! Good luck with your purchase decisions ! I’m probably going to go for the hp omen 15 as it was my 2nd option . All the hp split talk is a little nerve racking but I think it will all work out in the end .",0
"What others have written about this laptop is true:-the hardware is fully capable of plowing through the best of PC games out there.-the fans are a bit loud, but not so loud as to be annoying, IMHO. For the kind of hardware inside, I fully expected louder than usual fan noise, and this was actually more quiet than what I expected.-the battery life is about what you would expect for a laptop with this kind of hardware . . . not very long at all. I don't mind, however, given that I fully expect to have this thing plugged-in whenever I use it anyway.There have been a couple of surprises:-After my first restart, the keyboard wouldn't work . . . like, at all. Fortunately, the software allows you to use a mouse with on-screen keyboard, and youtube has plenty of video on how to uninstall and re-install the keyboard software/drivers. Took me 5 minutes to fix, and the keyboard has worked fine ever since.-The screen seems a bit . . . fragile. I think a tiny bit of debris must of been on my keypad when I shut the laptop the other day, because now there is a mark on the screen that I cannot remove . . . either a scratch or crack. It's not big enough to be distracting, and worst case scenario, it appears that I can replace the screen for about $100. Still, it IS a bit disappointing to have a mark on my screen only a few days after purchase.Overall, I really can't complain about the laptop . . . for the price, the hardware is unbeatable, and if ever I want to upgrade/replace the screen, RAM, or SSD, I can invest the extra money to do so.",0
"I kind of doubt there's a cheaper laptop on Amazon with this level of performance.The biggest con, and it's a con with all 3 of the HP laptops I've owned, is that either the charge port or the charger itself is crap. When it's plugged in I have to sometimes wiggle the charger or orient the charger in such a way that it actually charges the laptop. For the price, I can deal with it.",0
Laptop looks great and is super fast. Only issue is while playing a game it would over heat really bad. Top of the computer would get to hot to touch. I even purchased a cooling fan for it and still would get the same way. Would’ve kept the laptop if this issue didn’t come about.,0
there were minor glitches when setting it up such as the hard drive being in two partitions and NVIDIA Ge-force Experience had to be uninstalled and reinstalled for it to work properly.,0
"This computer is light and has a huge screen with decent graphics that is perfect for work or streaming movies. Setup is extremely easy, you get guided by Cortana's voice through the process.

Go for it without having second thoughts.",0
"Excelent laptop for designers but if you’re looking 4 a gaming laptop this is not what you’re looking for, i purchased for both uses but when I run a game such as ark it only lets me play like 25 min, then it automatically closes the game and says that an error was ocurred due to overheat, because the cooling system of this laptop is awful. But if you ain’t looking 4 a gaming laptop then this laptop is absolutely amazing. Hope this honest review help y’all to make sure this is what you are looking for",0
I bought both of minefrom best prime products.One has worked wonderfully.One quit charger and I've recieced no help with it. Wouldn't recommend.,0
I liked it a lot but the only two things are that the product code didn't work for Office 365 and also it would be better if it was touchscreen.,0

The battery life is not quite as good as my last ASUS Vivobook.,0
"The touchpad mouse stopped working not even 30 min into using the c-book. The keyboard doesn't have the same ""features"" as a standard computer/keyboard. Also, you don't get many instructions on how to use the thing. There should be an instruction manual that at least reviews how to mimic standard functions of a regular keyboard with the c-book. Made working very difficult and frustrating. If you're not good with change and patient enough to figure out the differences between a laptop / chromebook, I definitely wouldn't recommend. Wasn't for me with all the quirks...",0

"Very impressed, handles Assassin's Creed extremely well, diedy not even get hot, can play hours on end with no issues.",0
Died after 1 year and 6 months. I loved the touch screen aspect and the long battery life. Used it mainly to write papers and research for my graduate projects. About 6 months ago it started to shut down and yesterday it wouldn't connect to the internet that all of other devices are easily connected on. All the while it is shutting down whenever it feels like it. Not worth it if you want it to die in less than 2 years.,0
"For the value, clarity, and functionality this computer is the best purchase I’ve ever made.",0
"I bought this laptop and have been using it for about 9 months. Immediately after I bought it, it would start blue screening while in use (almost always due to kbclass.sys despite the fact that the keyboard is built-in) and then would not start up for 2-3 days. The manufacturer has blocked resets and I can't reset the PC from the cloud, from a USB device, or from the local file system.Don't buy this laptop.It breaks and is unfixable.",0
I seem to get about 2 hours' worth of use doing really basic lightweight work with the battery saver on.,0
"At first glance this seems like a great laptop with decent specs, and the price is attractive. However, once I used it for a few days the corners that asus cut to make this price possible emerged. The housing of the laptop is very thin aluminum, this allows the heat from the processor and graphics card to dissappate without using a built in fan. This causes the laptop to overheat and the bottom becomes so hot it can't be placed on one's lap. Probably as a result of the heat, the battery started to deteriorate and after just 2 weeks it wasn't holding a proper charge, I was forced to return this laptop. Maybe I got a bad egg, and not all of these laptops have overheating problems. Next time I'll just stick with Dell. Amazon as usual were exceptional in their support and I got a refund no problem.",0
"I ordered this computer as an architecture student with an intent to do autocad, renderings, etc. This computer lags, the picture quality is average at best and it gets hot FAST and dies FAST.

"The Victus line of laptops from HP is supposed to be for budget-conscience gamers who want a laptop that has decently powerful internals but forego some of the unnecessary things like RGB lighting and an elaborately designed case. I think that it mostly delivers on that idea, but this is still an $1100 machine and other brands like Lenovo are capable of delivering the same specs with a good screen and a little RGB (at least on the keyboard).The first thing I did when I got this laptop was upgrade the Ram to 32GB, mostly just to see if it would cause any problems using third party, 3200Mhz DDR4. I was really annoyed to see that there is no easy way to expand the storage. This laptop has a single M.2 slot and no place to install a 2.5-inch SATA SSD. The only thing that can be upgraded at all, is upping the Ram to 32GB (it will support 3rd party sticks at the full speed of 3200MHz).The Ryzen 7 5800H is one of the most powerful 45 watt processors from AMD, it is still quite good but it has been replaced by the 6800H. The difference isn't huge, but it's worth mentioning that you are getting a 2021 CPU in a 2022 laptop. The 3050Ti is still current generation, as it will be a while before the laptop versions of Nvidia's 4000 series GPUs are released. It has a 75 watt TGP, which is close to the top end of how the 3050Ti can be configured. I have used another laptop that has an 85 watt version of the 3050Ti and the performance of the two laptops is very similar and I wouldn't be worried much about it being slightly less than the maximum TGP.I really love the keyboard on this Victus, it's backlit but the only color is white. I think some people might prefer this look because it's more conventional, and kind of just looks like a regular laptop. The trackpad is really smoot and accurate, it's pretty large as well (for a Windows laptop). It's slightly off-centered, but it's not as bad as some laptops.The port selection is good, I wish they would have given us at least one 3.2 gen 2 USB C port, but all the ports top out at 5 Gigabits per second, not a huge deal, but it seems like another unnecessary feature to leave out. Just like the lack of power delivery charging via the USB C port, it's only data and video output only, no PD charging of the laptop itself. If it was available, it wouldn't provide enough power to allow you to play games, but it could work if you were using the laptop for anything non-gaming related.The last thing that I have to mention is the screen, it is 1080p with a 144Hz refresh rate, but the colors are kind of dull and disappointing for a laptop that costs over $1,000. It only has a 45%NTSC color space, which is pretty far from 100% sRGB. It's not awful or anything like that, but it's another compromise you have to make if you buy this HP Victus. If they could have given us a good screen for this price, then I could have forgiven the rest of the shortcomings. I just don't understand why they didn't try a little harder to make this competitive with other gaming laptops around the $1,000-$1,200 price range. It's like 85% of what you would get from the competition, assuming you bought wisely. So, in and of itself, it's a decent gaming laptop and you won't likely be able to find much better in the way of internal specs (CPU/GPU/RAM) for this same price, but you will find some with better screens and the same CPU/GPU that also have a 2nd M.2 slot for adding another SSD. It's up to each individual buyer to decide of these things are a big deal to them or not.Pros+Roughly the same price as other systems using a R7 plus a 3050TiNice, large trackpad and a good, backlit keyboard3050ti is configured at 75 watts (not the highest possible but close)HDMI port is version 2.1Nondescript chassis might be appealing to people who want/need a dedicated GPU without RGB and an over the top designCons-Screen is only 250 nits of brightness and 45% NTSC (you should get 100% sRGB and 300-350 nits of brightness for $1100 with these specs)No USB C chargingAll USB ports are limited to 5 Gigabits per secondNo way to add more storage short of replacing the drive that has Windows installed on it. What’s worse is that there was a place on the logic board for a second M.2 slot but HP chose not to install it on this version.There are other laptops for this price with the same specs, better screens, and with 2x NVMe M.2 slots for more storage (which equals more room to store games)Update: I realized that virtualization based security was enabled on this laptop, if you turn the “core isolation/memory integrity” slider to off in the Windows Security application, performance for gaming will increase by a substantial margin. My score in 3D mark went up by several hundred points.",0
"La laptop, es realmente buena, tal y como se muestra en la descripción.El procesador y el SDD hacen que sea un maravilla el utilizarla con windows 11. (si se instala windows 10 los drivers, dejan de funcionar), pero realmente vale la pena, el almacenamiento es limitado, si no se instalaran juegos pesado o muchos esto no seria un tema.La velocidad con la que abre los programas es increíble... android studio, visual studio emuladores de android, maquinas virtuales y demás cosas para programar es increíble la forma en que los abre y compila.Aplicaciones normales que mas puedo decir al instante.La velocidad con la que se inicia la computadora no es de mas de 13segundos en iniciar colocar contrase?a y ya estar manipulando el sistema.Las únicas pegas que le daría al equipo son justo el almacenamiento, y que la salida de aire del ventilador es justo por debajo de la pantalla, eso me causa cierto temor a que se da?e con el tiempo la pantalla.",0

As soon as computer warranty expiring it will get break down . the problem of ASUS laptop is black screening randomly. quality of material used in screen is very very poor.",0
This laptop performs extremely well. when plugged in your gaming performance is what you would expect for the hardware. thermals are handled well and by far my favorite thing the panel. it has great colors and brightness. very sharp. the darks are not great but that's more to do with backlight and panel type.The keyboard layout is a bit strange to me and I make a bit of mistakes pressing the control key instead of shift but this is something I expect to train my way through.,0

Great for the price. Very fast!",0
We are satisfied with the product. It has a qualitiy look and feel,0
This is the first laptop i have bought in years and after a ton of research i can sleep knowing ive made the best choice ! I am more of a console gamer but bought this laptop to also play a few games i enjoyed playing on pc when i was younger as well to use just for daily entertainment. The laptop looks amazing and runs just as great. I bought both the heavy duty case and mouse that are compatible to the laptop and all together each product have me head over heals in love with the laptop. I have been showing it off on social media and the feedback have served as just more reinsurance that I made the best choice!,0

The only thing that I dislike could be the cpu temperature because sometimes reach 90 celcius without warning and I must turn on the fans manually to control it (Windows 11) I've been reaching out for solutions and seems to be an optmization issue with W11,0
"Company could not offer a replacement battery NOR would they offer a credit. My only option was to clear laptop, return and invest the time setting up another device. Would never order from this company again.",0
It okay if u playing the sims 4 just not any heavily gaming and u need sd card,0
"Delivery good, product looks good. Unfortunately when I turned chromebook on a message said this is last update you will receive, AUE expired. I thought this used unit was only a few years old and Auto updates usually lasted 4-5 yrs or more. As a senior citizen disappointed I wasn't told this by seller prior to purchase.",0
"This might be one of the best MacBooks currently in the market, but it has limited functionality compared to Windows PCs and even certain Chromebook features. The MacBook Air has a beautiful screen but no touchscreen support. It also has an excellent trackpad. However, the MacBook doesn't allow you to perform certain basic features without paying for additional software to access them. For example, you can't snap multiple windows next to each other as you simply would on Windows PCs and Chromebooks.",0
"With all these super features, how is it possible to have such a bad screen? so bright and its suffers from bad viewing angles. It's like those first LCD screens. Even the black color is not so black. Its bothers my eyes a lot.I'm super disappointed, it did not even occur to me that it would come with this kind of display, I thought these just came in low-cost laptops.I would love for my money to be returned so tha I can buy me another with the same characteristics and a decent screen.And I don't like the touchpad, it just doesn't work very well.Also, I do not know what they were thinking when they decided to change the standard location of the end, start and all keys around the numeric keypad.Even so, I do not question the performance and the quality of the sound surprised me, it has very good speakers. It just that... THE SCREEN ITS VERY IMPORTANT FOR USER EXPERIENCE.",0
Great computer! Bought for my cousin and she loves it. Very lightweight and easy to manage! Great for college kids!,0
the laptop creaks when I pick it up,0
Poor design - lid is too heavy for the hinges and causes the lower chassis to crack on each side from the stress and the lid will no longer close properly.,0
"Was overheating playing Battlefield V and Warhammer III. Core temps all reached 90s+ consistently but core #2 and 3 got up to 97-100 regularly as well. Also the W key appears to be failing. It consistently stopped working while playing games that required keeping it depressed... In Battlefield V I would stop running and died quite a few times from it. Overall this laptop is very nice, but i cannot believe the temps, I have tried all different cooling profiles, and have always had it sitting on a laptop cooler running full blast as well. And the the w key acting up has me pretty nervous too. It could be software related but i am not taking a chance.",0
Overall very great laptop. Just wished I wasn't fooled by the fake aluminium look.,0
Great laptop. Very useful.,0
Beautiful screen and only 2.2 pounds as advertised,0
"Great computer overall! My main issue with it is that when running games like Fortnite for example, it will tend to overheat, and the fans are loud af. So just be prepared for that. Good specs. Fast computer! Definitely good deal for your money!",0
It feels way more expensive than its price. Good build quality.,0
La laptop llegó en buen estado :'),0
i have been able to download and use the apps i want,0
Excellent,0
The screen quality is not the best but what did you expect for 400? I bought this for school and some light gaming and got exactly what I wanted and needed.,0
"the frame of the laptop is almost too flexible, it seems like they made the chassis too thin",0
"I was looking for a laptop that was easy to use, light and portable since I live in a apartment with wife and 2 kids there is no space to have a full blown desk so I needed something small and fast and this new MacBook Air is perfect, I love everything about it, battery life is great but then again I mostly use it for light web browsing and email checking nothing heavy",0
"The i3 processor is pretty slow for a laptop around this price range, quite sluggish.",0
"Buena opcion en calidad-precio, la pantalla no es tactil pero tiene buena visualizacion y es una computadora bien equipada",0
Everything is so good. The minor problem is that sounds are not enough loudly.,0
Can't live without this computer now. It's perfect! Highly recommend,0
"The short version is that this is by FAR the best laptop I have ever owned.But to give some context: I am a middle aged working mom who primarily wants a good laptop because I am impatient with lag and because I take a billion pictures. BUT, I do play World of Warcraft once or twice a week so whatever laptop I use needs to be gaming quality. My oldest son just (last week!) graduated from Full Sail University with his BS in Game Design so he is obviously a very heavy gamer. He's home right now for the holidays and I had him give this beauty a good test drive overnight, trying it on WoW and on some Steam games he plays. Both of us LOVE it and my son proclaims it better than his Full Sail laptop.I LOVE:+ GREAT graphics. I can have WoW set to the max graphics and it looks amazing.+ SUPER fast processing - everything, every game, every site, everything loads in a blink. WOW what a pleasure.+ I love the keys. They are slightly elevated and have, I don't know how to say it, good differentiation between them. What this means for me is far fewer typos as my fingers seem to find the right keys unerringly. Also the keyboard can be set to be backlit, which I like.+ Great storage. 1 TB which is enough for all my pictures!+ 3 USB ports, also an HDMI port+ The power cord is in the back which I think is brilliant! I hate side mounted power outlets because what if it doesn't fit your set up (what if your power cord is on the left and where you sit the wall outlet is on your right)-- then you have to drape the cord around you and it's irritating.+ Slim, light (5 pounds!), and quietGAMER SON LOVES:- Easily handles 60 FPS at maxed our graphics- Runs several programs jointly with no slow down or fan use- 1 TB of available storage perfect for storing games- Sound speakers can play extremely loud- Multiple USB ports for gaming BOTTOM LINE: Powerful, beautiful, lightning quick, and a TB of storage. LOVE LOVE LOVE!Note: The specs are well documented on the product page which is why I don't list them in detail but in short: Intel Core i7 8th gen processor, 15.6"" screen, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics, RAM 16 GB DDR4, 1000 GB Hybrid Drive",0
Stopped charging after a month and a half. Very disappointing.,0
you will find the most infuriating thing is the STUPIDLY PLACED UP BUTTON.,0
The onboard software packed with this is very nice and limited,0
"Received this product yesterday, it's a GREAT laptop for the price, funs all games I've thrown at it at max settings and doesn't overheat. Speakers are kind of ""meh"" but I hook up a pair of external ones anyway. My one complaint is the laptop I received has the tiniest sliver of dead pixels at the bottom of the screen right along the bezzle (only maybe a 1/2 inch in length). It's not noticeable unless whatever's on the screen is black.other than that I can't recommend this laptop enough!",0
"after I update BIOS driver and graphic card driver, black screen boot loop happend.Tried everything but couldn't fix it.now refund is in progress.",0
"With the 13"" screen, the pixel density is great and makes 1080p video look great.",0
"OK, it comes with its share of bloatware that takes a bit of combing through to dispose of. But the machine is quick, lightweight, and the screen is crystal clear. I really don't use the camera or speakers, so have withheld comments. My wife has a previous generation of the same laptop, and has used it for a couple of years without problems. This was the main reason I selected this brand and model over similarly priced laptops.",0
Works well for what I need.,0
"When I first received the laptop the metal around one of the USB ports was bent, which was mostly aesthetic so I was able to ignore it. The laptop worked great until recently when the sound completely stopped working. Neither the built in speakers or plug in headphones produce any sound besides a small crackle. The only way I can hear sounds is from Bluetooth headphones. Customer support is a pain to deal with, especially now because phones are down.",0
This PC is really loud when compare to a Lenovo ThinkPad or the Lenovo Chromebook. This thing when the fan blows you can hear it and also sometimes it gets really slow so I can't multitask. I mean basically it's slower than a refurbish 10 years old Lenovo ThinkPad but most time it works fine. You see I bought this thing to replace the 10 years old refurbish Lenovo for the most part it's fine but for some odd reason sometimes it gets really slow and then the Apple Music APP just stops working. It happened today so I got angry and switch back to the Lenovo ThinkPad. The way it is I think it would be better if it backs up the Lenovo ThinkPad.,0
M1 air still the best choice for most of users,0
"The laptop is great and would’ve given it a 5, but the power adapter/charger died in me after like 6 months.",0
"I'm giving this laptop 1-star, even though it probably deserves 2 stars, because there are some glaring issues with Razer and their design team that they refuse to address after 7 years of Razer Blades, and it's getting ridiculous at this point.I really thought they'd get it right with all they've learned and this new redesign, but clearly they haven't. I'll give you a rundown of the problems with more detail later.List of issues:- ? key is in the wrong place (so frustrating to type)- Keys with a 2nd function (all f-keys and ?,>,<, etc) don't backlight their secondary function so you can't tell which keys control volume at night- touchpad lockout when typing is terrible. My mouse always jumps around when my palm touches the touchpad while typing- This laptop runs VERY hot. Even just using a web browser causes the palm rest to heat up.- no fingerprint reader for windows sign-on in a $2500 machine- The laptop isn't too heavy for what it is, but the power brick is SO HEAVY. Any weight savings from the thin laptop are lost if you have to carry the brick- Razer proprietary power jack means that replacement/additional adapters will be very expensive ($100)- They keyboard is ok, not great. You'd think for a gaming laptop they'd put a more robust keyboard inside. This one fees like the keyboard on a microsoft surface pro (which is fine, but not great for gaming)- There should be an additional USB 3.0 port on the opposite side to future-proof the machine. Also, the laptop should be able to run off a thunderbolt charger, and just disable the graphics card when doing so.- Fans run audibly even when computer sits at idle- Green Razer logo on back of screen cannot be adjusted (color or brightness). I'm not thrilled about advertising to people that I'm working on a $2500 machine. Razer clearly cares more about their marketing than the potential safety of their users against would-be thieves.- And possibly the biggest issue - THE LAPTOP DOESNT CHARGE IF YOU PLUG IT IN AFTER IT'S BEEN TURNED OFF. Yes, you read that correctly. You must turn on the laptop, then turn it off with the power adapter plugged in, for it to continue charging. Between this and the ? key placement, and the poorly designed keyboard and backlighting, I'd say these flaws are unforgivable in a $2400+ machine from a reputable company with 10+years experience in hardware manufacturing.I'm returning this one and getting a Gigabyte Aero 15x, which I'll also review once I receive it.",0
"If you're looking at a 3080 laptop, it means you need it because you're a gamer, or you have too much money and wanted to splurge. If you need a laptop for work, your 60 year old co-worker will sweetly ask you what games you play. If you need a laptop for content creation, go with with a QHD laptop. If you need a laptop for mining, stop reading and go re-evaluate your life.Know what you're not getting:- you're not getting a webcam/mic- you're not getting a quiet system, not to say the fans are inadequate, but you should have headphone on for gaming anyway- a 400 or 500 nits screen - it sits nicely indoors at 300 nits- a lightweight laptop - do the research- a thin laptop - again, no one should be surprised- a CPU that's clocked to run hotter than the GPU sometimesKnow what you are getting:- fast screen and response time - even everyday use is smooth compared to 120 and 144 hz. I have trouble seeing the difference between 240 hz and 300 hz- excellent keyboard - it's not for everyone, but if you love mechanical keyboard and the satisfying clicks, you'll probably love this. Check out Linus' video on this laptop.- top of time line specs - at least for the rest of 2021 and half of 2022, you're not going to need to upgrade- a way to let everyone know your RBG game is on point, and that you're probably really sweaty- very good speakers for a laptop- a cooling system that you can customize in armour crate - #lifeprotip, cooling the CPU also cools the GPU",0
Great appeal aesthetics,0
"For it's price, this laptop does it's job fairly well! Upon first opening the box it was immediately easy to smudge the top of the laptop, as shown in the photos, but I don't personally care about its outward appearance. The actual laptop was very functional and easy to use right upon opening it. When it comes to getting a gaming laptop, I put it through some stress tests, first of which is Skyrim special edition on ultra graphics. And to my delightful surprise, it ran it lag free! but this is where I encountered one of my 2 gripes with this laptop, the fans were SO loud! But I just put on a pair of headphones and didn't really notice them anymore. The second problem I encountered was its battery life! while playing spore on high graphics, which aren't that taxing on a normal computer, the battery lasted 1 hour... Put simply the battery is bad, but if you keep it plugged in as you play any game, it will work fine! In conclusion, this computer has a total of 2 issues, and both of them are easily fixable! Absolutely love this laptop so far!",0
"Really like this laptop! Lightweight, fast. everything I wanted.",0
"I run Elementary OS (a un Ubuntu Linux-based distro). It works pretty well, although from time to time, I have some issues and the computer becomes almost (but not totally) frozen and I've to hard-reset it. I blame ElementaryOS/Ubuntu/Linux about this. The laptop itself is beautiful.",0
"This laptop performs phenomenally! Capable of running Elden Ring at 1440p High settings @60fps! That’s incredible and I love it. Currently using the laptop for on the go gaming and editing whilst also using it on downtime with my 4K 55” and it works perfect! This thing can run a surprising amount of games at 4K and 1440p perfectly fine. The system gives a lot of fan settings to really tune it up to how you want it to play. Extreme mode is the best for absolute gaming but it can get very loud, I recommend default of Quite if you plan to just watch YouTube or something. Build quality is strong and the keyboard is great! Beautiful system all around.",0
"Received my laptop today, it was packed very good and secure. I was so excited to get it up. Start up time was a bit lengthy but once set up was completed, everything is moving swiftly. Love the look/design. It is slim with a professional design. Love the touch screen feature! I haven't gotten to assess the battery life properly as i just got it but so far so good.",0
Less than 2 hr batteryNo protection on it,0
"I purchased this laptop for work and also for personal. It is the best laptop I've purchased thus far. I love that it has a 10-key. I do wish the battery was better, but I can normally get through roughly 6 hours of work before it dies. It is very fast, they keyboard is quiet and comfortable to type on. The laptop itself is SO light. I can just carry it in my purse. Very slim. Love it.",0
I absolutely love this pc. I am a big gamer and it runs smooth as butter.,0
"Fan is noisy when playing movie or gaming, other than that it is a decent product.",0
"This is by far the worst computer I have used in the past 20 years. It doesn't come with Microsoft office, this is why this laptop is cheaper. The product spec claims up to 3.4 Ghz, when you open the task manage it states it's a 1.6 Ghz, far cry from 3.4 Ghz. I bought this laptop to do word, excel, surf the Internet and read e-mails. This morning, it took about 5 minutes to open an excel doc. The fan always runs like crazy and the fan is loud, I can't figure out what is going on in the background. I buy a lot of items from Amazon and I have never written a review, basically because I've always been satisfied, but not this time. I will never buy a PC/Laptop from Amazon again after this experience. I will buy it from somewhere I know exactly what I am getting, I can try it out and have it supported.",0
"En el poco tiempo que la llevo usando me ha funcionado de maravilla, el único descontento que tengo con este equipo es la calidad de la pantalla y que en ciertos programas baja la resolución. Pero en trabajos un poco demandantes es un buen equipo, yo la utilizo principal mete para programación de microcontroladores",0
"Just opened the package so I can't speak on the battery life among other things but I was sent a used charging cable. The cord is filthy and it's not dust, it's sticky and has food all on the charging cable. This is disgusting!!!",0
"I've had this laptop about 18 months and it's been a really bad purchase.If I allow the screen to go black after inactivity after a few minutes (Standard laptop/computer operating) there is a high likelihood that I will have to manually restart the computer by holding down the power button until it shuts down and then restart it.^THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED ISSUE - IT HAPPENS TO MANY USERS^I had to send it away after about 11 months because the battery charging port had become loose so I couldn't charge the laptop. Thankfully that was in warranty but I still had to pay a hefty shipping fee to Acer.^ I subscribed to a year warranty and just about got it in before that ran out - i was quoted $100's of dollars for what should have been a simple repair at local stores - hopefully you are more savvy than me, but I also got lucky ^It came back with a screw missing where the screen hinges to the base and it's probably going to get worse and worse (looking for a solve - but testament to the shoddy workmanship and care).The audio is one of the most frustrating elements, two tiny speakers are placed on the bottom at the sides. This means that sound is easily muffled and pointing away from the user, awful design on top of little power means that headphones are a constant must have.I often have to disconnect and reconnect to the internet several times before it actually gets an internet connection (at home, where it should always be connected).Long story longer: don't buy this laptop, it's flimsy, the sound is terrible, and unreliable.",0
Husband got me this as a little happy and honestly it’s a great fast little computer! Super satisfied with it!,0
"Not a touch screen, bought it for crafting business I hope to launch soon.",0
"I bought this laptop , the screen is in great quality. It boots up really quick, and don't freeze at all. It's a really good laptop only bad thing about this laptop is the battery life It will last a hour or thirty minutes during use and needs charged .",0
Definitely a mid budget gaming laptop. The battery life is not great. But a good processor and 165hz for about $1000 is a good deal!,0
Fan sound is sometimes irritating but I think for Gaming you have to bear it.,0
The thin bezel is likewise less impressive in person,0
"I bought a Asus TUF, Acer Nitro 5 and the Legion...yes the Legiom does cost a bit more than the other two but it’s a significant bump in quality and performance. The other two laptops have decent internals, but the build quality left a lot to be desired, the web cam on the Nitro died after one day and when I tried to install a 2nd storage drive in the TUF, the m.2 slot broke off. The Legion has no issues like this, nor would I expect it to, it feels extremely solid and durable. The fans are noticeable under load but not too loud and excessive heat is never an issue. Performance is as good as you can get at this price point and the screen looks pretty amazing. The best part is the warranty, it’s a 1yr in home repair (can be extended) and you can add accidental damage for less than $20/yr.",0
"The hinge is a bit stiff, and cannot be opened by a single hand like the macbooks",0
"My last gaming laptop was a MSI GE62 Apache Pro series which served me very well over 5 years but the build quality of the case to the hinge made me debate this purchase to another MSI model. I am glad I decided to go with MSI again.For the price I purchased this for I can't find a laptop that has even come close to the price. The RTX2070 has made such a huge difference. All the games I was previously playing on Medium settings I can now play in Ultra at 120+ FPS constantly and the fact that I have a portal unit that can play VR is amazing as well.The keyboard is a beautiful array of colors that is just memorizing effect like that of the high end RGB keyboards. The laptop does get loud when gaming but it disperses heat so much better than the GE62 I had and no longer cooks my twig and giggle berries while on my lap.The build quality has increased greatly and the side bezeling is greatly eliminated and over all the laptop is very light for a gaming laptop as well.I'd highly recommend if you are looking for a new gaming laptop but don't want to spend that $2,000 (US) mark but still get screaming performance.",0
"Excelente equipo, fantástico desempe?o!Lo único que encuentre por mejorar, es la parte de la carcasa.",0
Only issue I found is a software glitch with the mouse pointer.,0
"I love the performance, keyboard, and track pad",0
"Just make sure you research graphics card, computer chip, ram, storage if you are getting this to play games. I didn't do my homework well enough and found my specs on the lower end moreso than I would like in retrospect. Otherwise, it's a good laptop but settings might need to be tweaked to lower setting to play newer more demanding games.",0
It says there 16gb *1 which means there should be only 1 stick but there is two sticks of 8gb rams.,0
it works very will but i do not like the pad,0
Perfect....,0
"This Laptop was purchased for my son to use for school, and I must say I myself is impress with the speeds and smooth feel when using this Hp laptop.",0
"The smooth monitor, best in graphics for laptops, easy gliding keyboard, and software that help enhance the over all experience when using this beauty.",0
"La computadora me ha parecido increíble hasta ahora, me encanta, he trabajado muy bien con ella hasta ahora, solo me ha presentado cierto desface en la pantalla cuando estoy muy atareada en realidad no se cual seria la razón pero del resto se ha comportado muy bien, los programan ruedan muy bien. En líneas generales el comportamiento tiene 18/20",0
The screen image appears blurred and the screen glitches continuously.,0
Very happy with the product,0
My daughter loved it!,0
Great product and great service!!!,0
It keeps kicking me out of my apps.,0
Love! My games look great on here and I love how silent the keyboard is. I only just got it in today so I will be doing an update after a few weeks! So far definitely would recommend!!,0
I wanted to purchase a laptop for one of our sales team members and needed to be mindful of the spending. This laptop and its performance met that expectation.I will be purchasing again and I'm actually looking now.I would recommend highly considering this.,0
Overall this is a pretty good laptop. I can run games like GTA BF 1/4 at high setting which is pretty good. However it does get pretty warm on a hard surface while playing games so I would definitely recommend a cooling pad if you're playing games or doing any intensive tasks. And especially if you want to lay it on your bed where it couldn't otherwise breathe. The biggest issue for me is the screen. The colors are DECENT but still not as nice as even a 120 dollar 1080p LG monitor. The viewing angle is TERRIBLE though both vertically and horizontally. Expect to have to tilt the screen to the exact angle and not look at it from the side. The popular Dell gaming laptop with the 1050 has a much better horizontal viewing angle and slightly better vertical. That laptop is also 200-300 dollars cheaper than this one. I would've expected better at this price point. The speakers are great for a laptop and I do like the professional styling of this computer though and the Apple Macbook aluminum is nice. However only the screen back plate and the keyboard plate are aluminum while the bottom plate is plastic. Again I would like to see a little better at 1 grand. However the 256gb ssd and 16 gigs of RAM are nice. Overall this is a good bang for the buck laptop with comparable performance to a 2500 dollar Mac.,0
Made the switch from Windows to chromebook and am happy with it.,0
"Very lightweight, surprised me when i first picked it up. Speakers are pretty bad, very low quality sound. Display looks great, but when using full-screen mode in YouTube through Chrome or Edge it lags substantially.Not sure if I'm fully sold on it yet.",0
"I stopped buying HP in 2008 after purchasing one of their top-of-the-line laptops and having nothing but trouble with it from day one. With that I had to struggle with support several times over the course of the next three months before they agreed to take it back and replace it -- when the replacement arrived, I sold it on ebay and decided not to buy HP anymore.Fast forward 13 years and I figured it was time to try them again for one of my new employees. We've been using Dell but I figured I'd save a few hundred and try HP again... a regrettable decision. She's had to call support multiple times and is losing work time trying to chase down HP's quality issues.Unfortunately I can't return it at this point and will probably wind up replacing it before the year is out. Looks like it's time to go on another 13 year hiatus from HP. Just glad I got my reminder this way instead of deploying a bunch of these at client sites and having a support nightmare.I'm giving it 2 stars, because the casual user may find it sufficient...but if you expect to use this 8 hours a day, you may want to consider a different brand.",0
"Use it for email, banking, shopping",0
"This computer has been such a disappointment. It looks beautiful and is extremely light and portable but it has caused nothing but trouble. Within a year I've had to replace the battery ( with little to no support from Asus despite multiple outreach). Keys regularly stick on the computer. It shuts off randomly and when on sleep mode, will frequently switch itself on and drain the battery over night. I've taken it to multiple people for check up and fixes and other than some serious hardware flaws, no one can quite figure out the problem.I'm quite gentle with my devices. I carry them in cases, I keep them clean and relatively dust free, I update my software including malware protection regularly but for whatever reason, this Asus has continued to be a let down.Not to mention absolutely zero customer service. I will be buying a new computer as soon as I can and not returning to Asus products again.Definitely worth it to just pay $300 more for a macbook air.",0
"1 week and it won't allow the option to connect to wifi, therefore no internet",0
Awesome laptop. Battery life is terrible ~1.6 hours but I don’t really use it without the charger.,0
Equally good a development and gaming platform - very happy with this laptop.,0
"I got this just to try it out. I play a lot of wireless VR on my Vive Pro and Quest 2. I figured this would be ok at it but thankfully it blew my mind. Yeah it is very loud when you turn the fans/turbo on but it seems to have great cooling. In VR, I don't notice it. Didn't think it could play VR well without a cable and thankfully I was wrong. Had an old router I hooked up and it is flawless, almost better than my i78700k, 3080, 16 gig ram (less than 300hz). Nice desktop I have but my mobo is a bit slow.Anyway, I used the laptops hot spot and still could play vr, maybe like a 4/10 but now, with the dedicated old router, easily a 8.5/10. Fricken awesome.Oh yeah, took one star off because the battery is not very long lasting.",0
Beautiful ❤️,0
Being under 5 pounds makes this laptop very portable and doesn't fatigue your legs over long gaming sessions.,0

"Almost everything is perfect about this laptop, however, one of my extra bass sony earpods produces continuous white noise when plugged into this computer, another earpods had the same problem but the volume is much lower, apple's earpods doesn't have this issue. I guess there's some low frequency bug in this computer which seems to be a common issue of the xps13. The speakers are fine.",0
"This laptop is amazing! Very portable and powerful. No issues with it at all. I've been using it for Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier Pro and After Effects. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a powerful, thin and lightweight laptop.",0
"This laptop is quick and very useful for many tasks, but recently about 3 months in, it starts randomly freezing for 3-4 minutes and it takes time away from the task at hand. I notice it a lot when using youtube from the browser and sometimes it does it for other applications as well. Everything is up to date and the PC is clean. I tried contacting Lenovo Customer Service, but there seems to not have any for this laptop and it's really frustrating.",0
"Bought a certified refurbished chrome book and day ONE of use, it's glitching & automatically turned off. Christmas present for my kid, and it doesn't even work properly. Bought early, so I can't even return it. Complete BS.",0
Sold my gaming desktop for personal reasons and decided to get a laptop that I can game but also take with me for work purposes.Wished Asus would given more in the package like a computer bag or an accessory tho.But it's perfect,0
Great for the price point!,0
"Took me buying and returning 3 computers to land on this gem. A back-lit keyboard, at last. I’ve only had it about a week, but I feel like this computer is worth twice the price. I also want to thank the seller for being so responsive to my issue (literally got back to me a minute later). Very kind and professional. 5 stars for sure.",0
"Recién ayer me llego y estuve probandolo en un uso cotidiano, la uso para la universidad.El envío duro un poco mas de lo que pensé, pero no supero la semana. Algo que no me gusto fue que la caja venia con un agujero. Quiero creer que por la aduana.En cuestión de la apto es muy rápida, nunca había tenido un equipo con características similares y se siente el cambio.La pantalla es buena (al no haber probado una full hd antes)El teclado se siente algo raro, pero es por costumbre, tiene tres niveles de luz pero en algunas teclas tiene unas ""manchas"". Lo agrego en la tercera foto, no se si sea normal. El único detalle es la falta de ñ. Se puede configurar el teclado pero no es lo mismo.La batería es decente. Al instalar todos mis programas duro muy bien.Lo que me gusto es el peso y tamaño. Es ligera y relativamente mas pequeña a laptops del mismo tamaño de pantalla.Obviamente voy a continuar probandola y actualizar la reseña.",0

This computer was purchased for school. I love EXCEPT the sound/ speakers. I have had to purchase speakers. Even at the loudest 100% I struggle to hear when not using the additional purchases speakers.,0
the button Max Fan is very useful.,0
"I bought 2 of these for my kids and they are great. Fast for normal games, great for school work, and great for videos. Seller shipped quickly and these were brand new. Still sealed in the box. I did add 8g more Ram but have not had any issues at all....very happy with this laptop!",0
"This is a great value for money Laptop.Not as elegant as some laptops ( but they are more expensive), and the bezel edges are a little larger than I would like. Apart from these minor things, it is a great laptop.Fast, reliable. Thin and lightweight. Does everything I need. Fast processing, with long battery life, ( compared to laptops I've had in the past). Would recommend",0
"I got this laptop for my schoolwork, it's nothing fancy but it is a great laptop for school and Microsoft Office. It's sleek and lightweight, I love it.",0
"I’m sure it’s good for some, just not me. Pretty slow on a very fast connection. Can not use iTunes without first dropping into Google Play from a PC or Mac. MS Office Online version pretty much not useable for lite business even. It’s a nice looking package but lacks basic use ability. Charger fitting very tiny and was obvious it would not last. Returned for full refund. Seller was great!",0
The HP Chromebook was very easy to set up and connected to the internet without any problems. There have been no problems in the first month of use. I'm not sure the battery would last a full 12 hours but it has been more than adequate in the days it has been in use.,0
"I bought this computer 9 months ago when I started my PhD. It has been great so far!-The battery life is exceptional - if I'm not running any games or any other intense software, it can run all day at work without needing a charger. This has gone down slightly since I bought it though.-Super slim and light. I carry it with me almost everywhere and it takes up barely any room in my backpack. I can carry it by itself easily as well.-Screen is matte, not glossy. I like this because it means I don't get a bunch of glare when I'm outside.-I can run jobs in RStudio pretty easily on this without needing to connect to an external server.-I can play a few games on this laptop, mostly The Sims and Stardew Valley. The graphics aren't exceptional by any means but I'm able to run these games without lag.-The only downside is the lack of ports - which comes with the slim profile. It only has 2 USB, 1 USB-C, one micro-HDMI, and one SD slot, so I've had to buy a lot of adapters and can't have them all in at the same time.-The fingerprint reader is convenient but sometimes it doesn't work for no apparent reason.Overall, for the price I think this is a great buy, if you don't need a machine that runs intense games or fancy software. Highly recommend for college students or anyone who needs to take their laptops on the go.",0
The power supply died after having the product for a month. As you can see in reading reviews elsewhere this is a common problem with this product. It's simply unacceptable that it is common that the power supply does not last longer than a month and then it is hard to get any help to get a replacement one. If you buy this computer you should EXPECT to be without a power supply for weeks and thus without a working computer. Simply put it makes the whole product a failure.,0
Every thing about this laptop is not right.,0
"It has been a great little computer for my teens to use for school, especially for the price; so much so that we bought one for each and a third for my husband's online teaching needs. Being a chromebook, it has its own version of ""Microsoft"" apps. I can't attest to how they function as my kids use Google docs through their school. The interface takes a little getting used to and the Notes app inevitably locks up the computer. But overall it gets the job done. The battery life is actually quite good given you can go almost an entire day without charging (and that's using it almost constantly). BUT it loses a star because the charger has now died on 2 of the 3 units that we purchased less than a year ago.",0
"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great! 2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel. I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good. Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard. Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic. Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great. Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT. Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great. Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN. That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap. Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE. It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time. For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast. Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU. Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still. Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons. On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA. Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch). You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay. And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks. Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc. Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS. Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort). Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame. I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery. Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem. Love it so far!",0
"Light laptop, it's what I was looking for, fast processor and excellent performance",0
Dose what I need it to and I don't spend 10 minutes waiting for it to boot up,0
"This laptop is blazing fast and is able to play games like Skyrim and Fallout 4 at ultra high resolution with high frame rates. Smooth and crisp graphics and a bright screen. The only issue I have so far is that the screen backlighting will turn itself off after about 30 seconds. I understand this as a battery saving technique, however there is no way to change the setting. Other than this very minor annoyance, I am quite pleased with the comp[uter and would heartily recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive or entry level gaming laptop.",0
"Muy buen producto. Excelente calidad audio sonido y gráficos, perfecta laptop para estudiante , para jugar sólo juegos para Mac , por lo demás perfecta",0
The keyboard has good feeling with decent travel distance while typing.,0
"love this laptop and it screen quality is great. clear, easy to type on the keyboard. easy use of an extended usb mouse. i don't like the touchpad personally preferred the usb mouse. screen is 25 inch so you can make the font larger and it doesn't take away from the view.",0
"Excellent overall, easy to set up and use, highly recommended.",0
"Not a gamer, so no comments on that. Everything worked out of the box. The ribbon connector for adding an SSD or HDD in empty bay was provided and it worked when installed. Seemed a little crude to have to have to ""install"" it and frankly it wasn't initially obvious how to do it. After setting up system from basic power up - manually checked Asus for SW & Firmware updates. Surprised at how many there were for a ""new"" system just purchased. Bios Firmware was a few levels back and every major driver and even the chipset had an update. installed all of the them and it still all worked - no problems to report. Battery life is so-so. It lasted about 1 1/2 hrs for a wireless Skype session (driving an external TV via HDMI) before warning that had about 10 mins left. Thought I'd get at least 2 hrs.The net - have used the system for about 4 weeks now with all manner of Apps used for work. It has preformed well.",0
I have purchased multiple laptops and this has to be my favorite one so far.,0
"On-line description did not mention that the computer could only be used with Microsoft approved sites and aps. It did not have a DVD drive and could not be connected to network printer. This computer may be just perfect for a student or younger user, it did not fill my needs. I could not give it a higher rating because of the limitations.",0
Great for the price,0
"I bought this laptop for school and for some light gaming on the side ( League Of Legends, Counter Strike ) and this card shoukd be able to push these games at 80+ FPS on max settings but I am sad to say that this is not the case. First LoL played fine at max settings at 100+ fps but there was terrible image tearing. Then I activated Vsync and it solved that problem. Steady 60fps then I installed CS:GO and it looked terrible. 100+ fps but nothing I tried fixes the issue. After updating drivers and changing the default graphics driver to the 1050 It just made everything worse. LoL never got past 30fps and csgo looked the same. This was disappointing.The screen is a TN panel which I understand has bad viewing angles but this tn panel has TERRIBLE viewing angles. It was very very bad. Not sure if it had anything to do with the bad gaming experience with low fps and such.On the brighter side.... The build was very nice. A metal build with backlight keyboard were a plus. Ssd speed was good too. Battery life was average and weight and dimensions were on the smaller side.This laptop doesn't feel cheap but unfortunately it just doesn't perform as well as it looks.",0
Great customer service The guy helped me to decide which other chuwi product can I get for me,0
"One man's treasure is another man's trash.The display is probably fine for most, but going from 4k to this was miserable. I have excellent vision, and I get refresh rate for gaming, so this is based on using it for work/browsing. It's so roughly pixeled on fonts that you can't read anything (or else everything is super huge and it's like hardly anything fits on the screen). It seems like a lack of constrast on black/white, almost like a dark gray and white.The sound isn't great, it's really tinny. I tried for a while messing with the settings on everything, it never pulled through for me like I had hoped. My 5 year old Lenovo has better sound.I hate that Fn key is required for home, end keys. They doubled them up but hurried them so they aren't usable. I recoded the keys but that only works so far..delete key is also poorly placed. They made scroll lock super available though, which I've never needed...so go figure. I guess that's another one of those treasures I just don't appreciate. Who uses that???Don't get me wrong, the wifi/processor/hd/memory/ graphics card/touchpad are great! Of course they are! Super quick!! I'll miss that, and only that, but that's not anything another brand/laptop doesn't have with those specs...so I can't give more than 3 stars on this one.The frame and everything is solid feeling. But the power and usb plugs are all obnoxiously positioned so if you use it plugged in (curiously positioned on the center right) there is no room for anything like an external track ball.OMG the fan is loud. If only that were as quiet as the speakers lol. And that's just installing programs. Can't imaging actually gaming with that noise.I tried working without it plugged in, and within no time it was draining the battery so fast...faster than my old laptop...too fast for how good this battery is supposed to be...especially if you wanted to game on battery.I dunno, I guess it's a great laptop for everyone else, but I was about to cry before I realized I could still return it..so I am.Sorry MSI, I guess I'm still an Asus girl.Now...if you'll excuse me, I have to find a 4k so I don't feel like I'm blind anymore.(I tried writing this on the MSI and I couldn't see what I was typing, so I used my phone...sad!!)",0
"The screen cover was broken after 1 year an 1 month of gentle use - that means just 1 month after the European warranty finished. ASUS service is pretty much non existent for laptops out of warranty in Europe (Romania): they told me that I have to leave the laptop at the service for 90 days. Obviously, I can't stay 90 days without laptop, I can not work, so this means they simply don't want to fix it. I must search for the screen cover over the internet, then buy and fix it in ""DIY"" regime. I'll never buy again from ASUS.",0
The Laptop I bought is marvelous!,0
"The instrument asks me to rate the touch screen, but I don't use it. I would gladly buy one without a touch screen if I could save money. The computer runs like a champ. The first two or three times I booted it up, it was slow because of software updates, but since then, it's been good and fast. I purchased this laptop mainly for photo editing; it works well with Photoshop Elements. The description says the keyboard is backlit, but mine is not. Not a feature that's important to me, but it may be to some. I especially like the 17-inch screen combined with the portability of a laptop.",0
All-round budget gaming laptop.Future proof with the 8 core amd processor and swappable components.Treat it with love and it should last a good 3-5 years.,0
Opened from box computer was having visual issues it couldnt handle the 60 hz frame rate and had to reduce it to the 48hz.The space bar doesnt work on the left side i can press it 20 times and nothing happens .I dont recommend for the price,0
The only issue I had was a constant blue screen. I updated my firmware and drivers and never had that issue again,0
the specs don't match what is being sod. good luck!,0
"Ordered this as a Christmas present, when I received it the corner of the laptops box was crushed.",0
"Laptop was packaged very nice, little bloatware, few updates to do right off the bat. Some Amazonians received a ""Chinese only"" Windows version, I did not.Out of the package the laptop looks great. Not super flashy, overall its aesthetically pleasing. When you open the lid you are met with a well designed Steelseries Keyboard. The laptop has a large palm rest area, almost too big imo, they could have spaced out the keyboard a bit better. I dont use laptop touchpads, but this one is one I would consider keeping my mouse unplugged for while web surfing and youtubing.Performance for the price is tough to beat. Beefy i7, little skimpy on the RAM only 8GB DDR4, easily upgradeable. Has the nVidia GTX 1050Ti 4GB GDDR5, the screen looks great no bleeding or anything, most laptops in this price range have just the 1050 or even lower specd GPUs. Also has 2 drives, a 128GB m.2 SSD which houses the Windows 10 OS, very speedy, I would buy a larger 2.5"" SSD to replace the slow 1TB.I havent pushed this laptop yet, and I dont really plan on it, I have seen other users on youtube get the CPU up to 91C, so it may get too hot for your lap.Battery life is going to be atrocious, and I fully accept that, I plan to stay plugged.I am very pleased with my purchase of this laptop, for the price and specs, I dont think you can pass on it.",0
"I researched for a month, to replace my Dell XPS-13. I wanted a slightly larger screen (14 inch), longer battery life (after three years the XPS-13 still gives me 6 hours), fastest, latest chipset (assuming that it would yield fastest processing speed,) and a chance to try out an OLED screen. Unfortunately, all of what I was looking for was not available in one unit, so I settled on the Zenbook 14X, which had most of what I wanted.- I was hoping to get a laptop that met the EVO standard of displaying the home screen in a second or two after opening the lid, but the Zenbook usually takes 7-8 seconds to come to life.- OLED is evidently harder on battery life than LCD, so while the OLED display is nice (not dramatically nice, but nice,) it sucks out battery life. I can't get any more than about 6-7 hours, doing email and Facebook. Many of the new premium laptops today, which I thought I was getting, get 9, 10 or more hours.- The fancy ""Innovative ScreenPad 2.0: 5.65-inch interactive touchscreen trackpad"" was so frustrating and annoying to use that I finally just turned it off, and use it as a plain old trackpad to move the mouse cursor.- I really wanted the brand new Intel Core i7 Gen 12 chipset, assuming that it would provide fast processing speeds. Again, disappointed. The Asus isn't any faster than the old XPS-13. In fact, while some processes that I can't measure must surely be faster with the Zenbook, I was surprised that the simple process of loading an excel or PowerPoint file from the local 512GB SSD was quite a bit slower -- a simple little 40k Excel file takes 3 or 4 seconds to load from the SSD, where the XPS did it almost instantaneously. 3 or 4 seconds doesn't sound like much, but when you are using lots of different files, it can seem interminable. Larger PowerPoint files easily take 8-10 seconds to load.- The 14 inch screen is the size I was looking for -- can't complain about that. But while the OLED is nice, it is not nice enough to give up battery performance for.- The exterior finish of the Zenbook, whatever it is, shows every fingerprint and smudge. I really miss the very professional metallic finish on the XPS-13.- One advantage the Zenbook has is a much more robust set of I/O ports -- USB, HDMI, Audio out, etc., where Dell has chosen to eliminate most of that, so I/O points go to Asus.So, in summary, my attempt to replace my old XPS-13 cost about $1,500, has no better battery life, processes slower, loads and saves slower, and is physically less attractive. I've been an IT professional since before Windows version 1 was announced, and have lots of experience with excellent machines. The Zenbook 14X has some good specs, but all in all, it is much less that I was hoping for. If I had it to do all over again, I would not invest in the Zenbook 14X. I wish I could return it and start my search for a high quality, fast, professional laptop all over again.",0
"I couldn't be happier, what a great surfboard! Amazing battery life with lightning speed! Really good speakers.. All in all a great experience!",0

NOT GOOD,0
"Holy c$%p, this laptop is a steal for what you get. It's an ASUS, it has a 10th generation i3 chipset, 8gb RAM and an M.2 hard drive. It needed a little tweaking with advanced power options bc it was glitching. The internet browser was freezing but changing power settings fixed it.. There are Youtube videos on ASUS viviobook lagging and you will find tips to remedy this. 5 minute easy fix that plagues most computers from the factory. This laptop is an amazing deal especially for the price and it would still be worth it if it was 500.00. The only negative to this computer is that the speakers are tinny and you will need to use external speakers if you use the audio frequently. Still...its a great laptop.",0
Easy to carry to and from work and also has the power of a gaming desktop.,0
when I close the screen it doesnt sit flush on the chassis.,0

"Got it for my girlfriend, she said “ it’s awesome sauce, best laptop I’ve ever had”",0
I bought an Aspire 5 thirteen months ago (now one month out of warranty). The right side lap top hinge stopped pivoting and the back and front case have separated from the screen- the hinge doesn't pivot so the plastic case has separated to allow the laptop to open. Acer will do nothing about this. I have noticed the newer laptops have a hinge that runs the length of the lid. I'm sure Acer knew of this issue and is not honoring any repairs. Other than that - the software works great.....,0
I would have liked the external speakers to be louder,0
Perfect laptop. Great screen and really fast. Highly recommend!!,0

3 week ago i bought Asusu zenbook Ux550Ge is overheating after 30 minutes in game getting crazy hot. (my cores getting up to 95 celsius) Wonder if it will causes any damage if i keep playing time to time for few hours?Than i did more testing a searching and figured out that I have some Backlight issue as well as Coil Whining.I guess i need replace this pice and hope that will be without these common issues. Giving 3 Stars and believe that not every single ZenBook ux550ge has same problems.,0
Bought this laptop about 6 months ago and still love it! Havent had any problems and does everything I need it to.,0
"I think what surprised me the most about this laptop wasn't it's performance and specs, but the value for your money considering the performance and specs. The IPS screen looks great, the keyboard lights up in different patterns, the battery life is OK, not great, but considering it's a gaming laptop, it does fine. I see another reviewer showed some specs so no use in repeating that. I guess the only thing I would like to see in these ""GAMING"" labeled laptops is higher capacity M.2 drives.. A 1Tb option would have made this a perfect value but I won't deduct a star. The reason I say that, is any more, many games consume alot of space, and if you have a huge collection, well.. you run out pretty quick. 512gb on this one is actually within reason and expected.. I guess I'm just griping that I'd like to see large quantity, fast storage, also become a standard when one claims to have a ""GAMING"" laptop. But anyways, WHERE CAN I GET AN RTX 3050Ti FOR MY DESKTOP??? I love this thing!! Seriously, no need to spend money on something spec'd with a 3080 on a laptop, this thing rocks!! And the fan sound doesn't ramp up too loud at all. A nicely done laptop all around if you don't count my nit pics. Gonna have to 5 star this one.",0

"OLD MODELS THAT BREAK - Seller should have returned these to Asus to switch out for newer versions to prevent hardware failures!!!I bought this model in February 2021, and after 2 weeks the keyboard stopped responding. I’m pretty technically proficient in repair and troubleshooting, so believe me when I say I tried everything. I reluctantly returned it and bought a replacement from the same seller, thinking it the second purchase couldn’t possibly ALSO have issues.The second one I bought in March 2021. It worked fine until yesterday, when the screen began to randomly flicker. Today I opened the lid to work on a document and the screen flash on and off again, black as night. After messing with the hinge angle, the screen stayed on long enough for me to do my work. But... this was a RED FLAG.I gave up and called ASUS tech support, where they confirmed my BRAND NEW LAPTOP was technically out of warranty (since 2018!!!!). I was shocked. This thing was brand new! After a lot of talking and sending them proof of purchase they KINDLY agreed to take it on under warranty and replace the Display.SELLER: SWITCH OUT YOUR OLD STOCK and save us buyers a lot of frustration !!!!",0
"Loads windows and games very rapidly. Excellent graphics.I bought two of these: one with a single 512 GB drive, and the second, ordered on this same page, came with two puny 256 GB drives. That means if I want to increase storage, I have to toss the 2nd drive for something of a reasonable storage capacity.Just thought you ought to know.June 30 21 Edit: Well, the little C: drive SSD filled up. I tried to use the 256 GB D drive but Unreal wouldn't install and complained of a drive error. Now the D is failed completely. Fine. it's was always useless. So I bought a 1 T SSD drive that was recommended in ""Questions"" and a screw driver to go with it. Getting those 11 little screws out was impossible - they were put in with Blue Locktight which is supposed to be removable but these screws are too small. Decided to return the whole thing because I'm close to the return date and I shouldn't have to put up with a ""not as advertised"" product with a bad drive that was DOA.My daughter is happy with her Lenovo though. She got one with the 512 GB drive, but she did fill it up with games. I'd be happy as well, if I just had one working 512 GB drive and I could open it for upgrades",0
"A lot of these reviews talk about the low refresh rate and how it’s was advertised to be 144hz. The refresh Rate 60hz, but on valorant I had a solid 300 FPS on high graphic settings. I would read the other reviews before buying but so far the laptop is running great and is built very well, and is VERY PRETTY. This is also my first gaming laptop so I wouldn’t know the best, but if you are looking for a well-built medium price laptop, this is for you. The battery life is pretty bad if you pay on the high performance mode but you can easily change to battery mode or in between both on the MSI Dragon center, or/and from the windows control center.",0
"Touch screen? Nope.Touchpad? If you are holding the laptop every part of it acts like a touchpad, but only when it's not supposed to. Aggravating to say the least. [Perhaps it's a new feature designed to prevent people from spending too much time on social media.]",0

SO far I am pretty happy about this purchase. Applications open up quickly, the battery life is great, the casing is durable, the device is lightweight, and I dig the fingerprint ID system for quick access. If you are just an average user who does simple tasks such as: email, YouTube, streaming vids or music, etc... this device is more than enough for you. If you are looking for a device to do heavy gaming... well... I doubt you are reading this review. For me, it's easy to rate this 5 stars. The only thing I'd say might be an issue for others (not me but for others) is the webcam. It's not the highest of quality, but who gives a rat's ***. I don't think they can get a high quality cam in such a thin case, so whatevs. Hope this helps.",0

I purchased this for a spare office workstation and it has worked well for that purpose. Screen quality is good and bright. I leave it plugged in usually so I can't fully comment on the battery life but supposedly it lasts 4 or 5 hours. Processing speed for basic tasks is fine. I don't think it would work at all well as a gaming machine.,0
I was super excited about this laptop the graphics are amazing but the charging and battery life are terrible. I left it plugged in all night and still showed no battery life it has to stay plugged in... also the fan is sooo loud as soon as you start running it. wouldn't even waste your money,0

I don't entirely care for the trackpad, which is why I'm only giving 4 stars, but I'm slowly getting used to it as well, & I can always go with a mouse instead. I would recommend this machine to anyone who wants an inexpensive web-content device.",0

"This is NOT a 120Hz screen, and it’s certainly not a very good screen either. While brightness is good overall, it’s very much in the “cold” end of the spectrum, with no “pop” in the color gamut, as you’d expect from the description. No amount of tuning(short of paying to have it done) makes much difference, it’s just “flat”. In fact, the panel shows as manufactured in 2014 (Chui Mei/Innova). The MSI model number shows up as GP73 8RF, which, according to MSI’s website is for release in LA only, and not a US model at all. I don’t know what kind of crap MSI is trying to pull, but Amazon needs to straighten this out. VERY disappointed.",0
"I've only had this for a month or so and the keys on the keyboard ""stick"" - i.e. i'm constantly making typing errors bc the space bar and shift key is very picky -- you have to hit it exactly the right place. Many of the key require A LOT of effort in your fingers to type correctly. That may be odd feedback but it's driving me mad -- and making my hand and neck hurt a ton too! Ugh. If it was still within the return window, I'd return it. I recommend continuing your search for an economical Chromebook elsewhere.",0
Love this laptop!!,0
The MSI customer service is extremely disinterested,0
Much lower than an optimal gaming laptop in my opinion. I had nothing but issues with this from the moment I got it. Returned after two weeks. Bought a different machine and it worked perfectly out of the box. Definitely spend the extra money for something more reliable.,0
This was the worse. Purchase it ever made. First off it was a 218.00 at best buy brand new...i paid 400 and something...and it wasn't new it was returned and I had so many files on it and a lot of viruses my son has to fills it where I could use it ...and they wanted 50% to restock. Ridiculous....It wish I would've read the reviews firsthand now its doesn't work cause its says my wifi adapter isn't. Downloaded right or something. I still can't take classes,0
"La laptop es hermosa pero hace un sonido raro al prenderla y a los dos dias de usarla mientras veia netflix me salia error 401 o 404 no recuerdo, en pantalla azul y hacia un sonido aun mas raro y fuerte. La bateria es poca.",0
I don't understand why older models support dual (or more) external screens and this new and 'improved model does not'. I bought on Apple and returned it.,0
"Screen is absolutely terrible, color is horrible. Can't play 60 fps video on youtube in 720p or 1080p.",0
At times the fans get a little loud,0
"There are a few disappointing things.:- The battery life is not great if you are doing anything involved. When my virus scan kicks in and decides to do a full scan it almost completely depletes the battery before it finishes, anything that makes the fans kick in:- The delete key is right next to the power button and they are the same size....:- The touchpad is often unresponsive, it comes and goes:- It is a very light laptop, the problem is it takes two hands to open the lid as you have to pry it open.It is very fast for CAD work though, vectorworks in particular is great.",0
"this laptop feels generally solid, with little body flex, and it looks super sleek and premium",0

The battery life looks decent; it can easily last two full movies on battery or typing a document all day.,0
I watched videos that talked about how good the keyboard feels. They were right. Replaced my macbook air with this X1 Carbon. Using it for work and personal use. Very happy,0

Beautiful device. Perfect for simply web browsing and ideal for teachers like myself that need to use Microsoft Office and Google Classroom etc. Definitely worth every penny. Treat yourself if you’ve been debating this over a PC laptop.,0
Well pleased with the product. Like new in asthetics and operation. Well done.,0

"I'm a laptop gamer, have been for over a decade. I've had Dell's rockin' XPS, I've had their less-than-satisfactory Alienware and when I needed a new laptop 6 years ago, I went with an MSI, due to the power at an incredible price. Think about that-- 6 years with the same gaming laptop. Ever since then, I've talked my daughter, her boyfriend, 3 of her friends, and two of my nephews into buying MSI and they all love them. I will never buy anything else. Now, to this review-- After 6 years, I needed a new gaming laptop so I bought this. Raytracing? Wasn't any hesitation. And it runs flawlessly! I'm running all of my games in Ultra mode and still getting a steady 60+ FPS. Here's a response to what other people have written:- Laptop is loud-- of course it's loud. That's because of the power inside. You're cramming the 3rd fastest video card on the market into an itty bitty chassis. So if you're complaining that it's loud, you simply don't get it. It's normal.- Low battery life-- It feels like the words ""desktop replacement"" have vanished from the PC gamer vernacular. It's not meant to run on battery. The battery is for if you suddenly have to move it, you can unplug it , move it, and plug it back in. Power goes out? Use the battery to sae your work, then turn it off. That's the whole idea.- The screen and video card are nothing short of amazing. 144mhz? Best screen I've ever used. No jaggies, no pauses, no split-screens. And the RTX card? MSI is one of the few companies that allows you to use the reference drivers directly from NVIDIA, and it's this reason that their laptops withstand the test of time. You get every update from nVidia, roughly one a week. New game comes out, nVidia writes it into their driver, you get it delivered to you. This is the main feature of the system. In contrast, Dell forces you to use their driver and rarely update it. Basically, the Alienware I bought was close to useless in less than a year.- Loud- yeah well, RTX card, lotsa fans running = loud.- heavy-- You're insane. This is one of the lightest gaming pc's on the market.- Sound-- okay, this one is legitimate. The sound is terrible, very tinny. But once I put my headset on, it sounds fantastic. So just figure on using headphones, which you're probably doing anyway to take advantage of spacial sound.- Space - yep, you're gonna need to get a second drive. So, people complain that the 512 gig ssd isn't enough to install a lot of games and they're right, but it's because they don't get it. The SSD should really be just for your OS and any read-write heavy apps. You'll need a second drive, probably a sshd or hdd and MSI, realizing this, has given us a second bay to install one. So quit whining.As you can see, I love my MSI and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Get one NOW.",0

"ASUS is a Brand I Love, so is ACER, Dell, Lenovo, Gateway and all! That a large Phone without a SIM. Your work gose like a Browser, you can't just click and Save your work, and to find it in a hurry, naaaaaa, I am so sorry I boufgt it. I like a few things about it, but they are not important!Serously. I can't do Chromebooks, they are on the right path, but need to Team up with Intel or someone! Maybe buy out Symbian or Team up with them!I will Gift it and I will always Love ACER. I can't and I am not saying tis Product is not goo, they are off awesome quality, works well, and its worth buying for countless reasons!All great Corporations with a very interesting OS. I need something else all because it will complement my Desktop/Office System, changing on the go to Chromebook is not working out. So yes, CHROMEBOOK are perfect for Countless people. Boots up fast too, all the Aps at your fingertips you need to ""Have All The Fun"" and much more! Thanks!",0
"I ordered this laptop as a way for me to still be able to play my favorite steam games and stay connected with my friends while I travel.Firstly, they shipped this very fast it was very impressive. Not sure if these kudos goes to amazon or the company.The laptop was well packaged! There are many slips and covers from MSI that it was shining and so sleek when out of the box.The screen size is a great fit for portability but it’s not too small either. While I don’t like laptop keyboards, this keyboard is very nice so far. I do have a mouse I use externally because I do not like to use trackpads at all, so I can’t really say how well the trackpad works.I think usb slots are somewhat awkward to be honest but overall the placement isn’t bad or a dealbreaker.I’m very happy that there is a ethernet port and hdmi as well! This makes it super convenient unlike apple laptops that require accessories and converters.I haven’t had the most time to test the battery life yet so I will post an update to review other aspects of the laptop after heavy use.So far it’s a great, convenient laptop for gaming!",0
I bought this computer brand new. I think was previously owned because a random essay popped up when I was searching for my essay. Today I’m fixing up my resume and I went to push “tab” and it did not work.,0
Works great! No problems. Fast service,0
"I bought this for a young child when it was on sale during Prime Day. We already had a 15"" Vivobook and like the brand/model. After receiving the laptop, I was happily surprised that the screen is better than the 15"" Vivobook we bought in 2020. Screen is crisp and bright and you can't see pixels or dots. The laptop is light and compact, but just be aware you won't have 10-key touch as a trade-off for the size.It came pre-installed with Windows 11 S mode. I've never had experience with S mode and it was slightly annoying to uninstall and convert to Windows 11 Home. I knew it only had 4GB of RAM, but it surprisingly wasn't too sluggish. It's enough for basic web browsing with a few tabs open, but it'll probably be slow if you have background processes and updates running at the same time. I immediately added 8GB of RAM for a total of 12GB and could notice an improvement. Usually the harddrive is a bottleneck, but that's not an issue with this laptop's NVMe M.2 drive. 128GB is enough for what we use it for, but it's nice to know you have an SSD slot open for future upgrades, or just swap out the M.2 drive. There is no SD or MicroSD card reader, so you'll need to use a USB drive or adapter if that's important to you. The 15"" Vivobook does have a MicroSD slot, so I was disappointed that they didn't include it with this 14"" laptop.I've bought budget laptops before, but this is one of the best ones in terms of screen quality, fast hardware, and weight & feel. If you're considering a Chromebook for your child's schoolwork, I think this is a better alternative, as I've found most cheap Chromebooks to be too small and limiting in their abilities.",0
"When I went into a $1000 laptop I felt I had set myself up for pretty low expectations. In the past affordable laptops had underclocked quad cores, and weak low power gpus. Thanks to Zen, this laptop actually cooks. The 4800h is comparable to to a Ryzen 3700 desktop processor and you certainly feel it. On this laptop Multitasking feels smooth like a desktop, and rendering almost feels the same (ram upgrade necessary). The 1660ti has no problems at all running games at ultra settings on the 1080p 144hz screen, while you likely won't hit 144fps to fully saturate the screen I never felt uncomfortable with the frames this laptop is able to produce. The computer only came with a 512gb SSD but, with the smaller battery there is an additional 2.5"" space made available and adding a 2tb basic spinning disk this computer really became the no compromised machine I was looking for. With this laptop I can go out of town, and not miss my $3500 custom desktop too much! I really don't feel like I lose much on this device when I have to switch on the go and that's the best review I can ever give for a $1000 laptop!",0
Es un equipo muy bueno para su precio en cuanto a hardware es muy buena cumple sus tareas correctamente.La calidad de la pantalla es un 8 de 10 muy buena si que es IPS y se nota.La batería en alto rendimiento dura unos 150 minutos.El rendimiento en juegos es bueno corre juegos actuales y obvio muchísimos clásicos.El chasis es lo.peor del equipo así como el teclado se siente de mala calidad lo que compensa todo lo demás como.digo es calidad precio.Recomendable para gente que la usa sin transportarla tanto aún que se siente firme les dejo el vídeo espero dicipe un poco sus dudas.,0
"I like how easy it was to setup. The functionality of it is very user friendly. I just needed a computer for internet/email/documents. This is a basic and perfect laptop for what I needed. It has met my needs. My only complaint is the screen can be kind of hard to see at certain angles. But definitely not enough to be a deal breaker for me and I'm finicky. Also, I wish the keyboard was back-lit. But also, not a deal breaker for the price.I couldn't see using this for gaming. But I'm not a gamer.",0
"Have just opened the laptop, with the view of charging in order to set everything up. Great help that the charger was for Europe and not Australia. How am I supposed to charge?",0
Bought for my daughter. She loves it.,0
I absolutely love my new Asus. I bought it for personal every day use. It's memory and processor alone were the key factors in making the decision to buy this laptop.,0
100% good.,0
"Powerful- game performance exceeded my expectations, even with just 8 gig of RAM",0
"The product didn't work right from the beginning. It would kick off in the middle of an application and it would shut down wifi. Also, it was difficult to turn and off.",0
This is a great laptop! I love it!!,0
The material is too much of a finger print magnet; frequent marks visible on the palm rests and behind the display panel.,0
"The only issue I have is keeping the GPU temp down when playing call of duty. It usually runs at 84c, but I don't have a cooling pad yet and also I dont overclock. I haven't had any issues with any game. The RGB lights are a nice touch and you can adjust brightness and colors. They also come in static or dynamic lighting too. Overall, great aesthetics and is worth the extra $200 for the rgb feature from the 78XL model. Good budget gaming laptop, no need to spent 2k",0
Great deal at the time,0
"Had high hopes for this laptop, but it is built with the cheapest components available, yet sold as a premium Asus machine with a premium price tag. I mean really an Intel 660p SSD...",0
It has a lot of memory. I love it.,0
"it has overheating/thermal throttling problems and you dont feel like you get your full value off of the 1050ti plus you can build a better pc overall with that kind of money, dont recommend you buy this crap",0
I am from the Caribbean and when I got my laptop last year it never came on. I am totally disappointed and would have loved to send it back but the time have passed. I spend so much money to purchase it.,0
Great little computer. No complaints at all,0

I love it. It is. Great meme brand and perfect for google drive,0

"I have owned this 6th gen x1 carbon for little over a year. I had some random times when the area to the top left of the machine was very hot, abnormally so. I got a stop code error a month ago, and a few hours before that the laptop started to overheat a bunch and run very quickly out of battery. I turned it off and on again and it fixed itself. Flash forward a month, it does it all day long agian but this time it runs itself into auto kill mode. I power cycle'd 5 more times before I resolved the issue, and this time i watched ""speedfan"" and noticed the cores were just fine in temp, it was my HD that was HOT. After the fact, my HDMI nor two type C ports work for connecting to displays, although the power cord still charges the laptop. I think i'm FUBAR, but as of this moment i bought a wireless adapter to try and creating a work around. that is until the next overheat session happens and this time my entire graphics card blows up! haha just kidding, but serioulsy lenovo plz send me a new laptop at this point. I had the screen replaced in December 2018 and now this?",0
Product is of good quality.,0

"Maybe I got a bad batch (bought mines from office depot and oddly enough this was the ONLY laptop they had avilable). My screen keeps blacking out, every hour my laptop over heats, AND i keep getting alerts my laptop needs to restart. Mind you I JUST bought this laptop and its making me miss my old laptop so much. Im scared to take an exam online with how my laptop over heats and it blacks out. Definately taking this back.",0
"Me acaba de llegar y al encenderla el touchpad no funciona y al intentar instalar los drivers no funciona...400$ en un producto que no funciona, pesimo esta laptop",0
"So far so good. I use ASUS laptops at my company and have about 7 of the K501U's. I was disappointed to see that discontinued but such is progress. I can confirm that after a day of setup and use that it is pretty good as a replacement for the K501U. It is light, stays cool, very fast, has a responsive keyboard, and a usable touchpad.I can confirm that the touchpad is a little quirky with regard to two finger scrolling. If scrolling constantly, it will sometimes get confused on whether you are trying to move the pointer or scroll the page, but it works tolerably. I'm a PC guy, so as much as I hate to admit it, Apple seems to have the corner on touchpad usability.The only other complaint I would have is the placement of the Home, End, PgUp, PgDn keys. They are only represented in the numeric keypad and only work with either numlock off or using the FN key. For some strange reason the manufacture decided that Pause/Break and PrntScrn were more important. ??? If this were a computer used in the DOS days or sold with a unix based OS then maybe these would be useful? Pause is nice for analysis of startup problems on older OSs but if things have gone that bad, it's time to hook up a keyboard. It's not a huge issue since there are ways around using those keys. It's just an annoyance.",0
"I like this laptop. To keep the laptop quiet and not overheat in games I did folowing. Find on the Internet how to enable the ProcessorPerformanceBoostMode in Power Option. Then select ""Effectively Aggressive"" instead of ""Aggressive"". Gaming performance will not drop, the Laptop will not heat up more than 60 degrees Celsius and will be quiet even under havy load.",0
We tried it the trackpad was broken. Got a return label but we had to pay to get it returned. Definitely a terrible decision. Look somewhere else.,0
"All good. Great laptop. perfect size and decent battery life. Exactly what I needed. My only problem is that the fan sometimes makes some noise and gets heated up pretty fast, and it's just my second day! It would make some noise for a few mins and then go back to normal. I'm just pretty concerned that it's only my second day of using it..",0
Good laptop!,0
Great computer! HP doesn’t disappoint!,0
The feel and look is impressive from the start.,0
"This thing is so slow and the hard drive is always clicking, and the cooling fan runs about 65-75% of the time, even when it's just sitting idle. It is maddeningly slow. I've kept only six applications on this laptop (Skype, Zoom, facebook, etc) in my attempt to have a fast laptop, and even with just those it's so slow. The screen is dim on maximum brightness, the battery lasts less than four hours, the quality of playback using the DVD/ROM is substandard. I tried to exchange this for a newer, faster (more expensive) model and the seller told me too bad, it was beyond the period.",0
"Me gusta la visualizacion de la pantalla, es mi primer laptop lo cual estoy un poco satisfecha con las especificaciones solo que le agregaria un poco mas de memoria ssd ya que la que trae de 256gb se me hace muy poco, aunque yo la uso para seguir con mis cursos de programacion, la bateria le dura poco nose si sea normal porque segun le duraba 8 horas, la verdad ni eso, desde que la tengo que son alrededor de 10 dias me ha pedido que la reinicie como unas 5 veces por actualizaciones, creo y eso es casi todos los dias, es algo molesto ya que en ocasiones la estoy usando y de repente se me pone la pantalla negra unos segundos y luego es cuando me percato que me pide que la reinicie, no tengo aun el mes y ya me estoy desanimando en querer regresarla",0
Nice screen and keyboard and good size.,0
It's just a decent laptop for minimal work.,0
"You can't hear anything with the built in Realtek speakers, volume at 100% is like 30% on my other computers. I had to buy a separate speaker just to hear anything. Would NOT buy again.",0
"I had an older model of this for a couple of years and LOVED it. I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this substandard, fails to meet basic standards, laptop. It's NOT fast (as much as I could tell, being able ONLY to use the trackpad. I am going to buy a year old, less specced xps 13. Because they just work. Out of the box work.",0
"It's a great laptop but there is no way I can get it to last up to 12 hours like it states even at lowest brightness setting, keyboard lights off and using it for only excel. More like 7 hours",0
love it!!!! its just alittle slow...,0
This computer has a low resolution screen. Flagship usually the best the company has to offer. This is not a flagship. Stop misrepresenting these computers!,0

"Screen is fine when it is working, but I often seem to have graphical errors. Either tge screen looks like it crashed or it simply blacks out despite being in use and charged. As a result I either have to close and reopen to fix or do a force powerdown.",0

"I don't know if the noise, the sometimes performance lag, or the quality of the material it is built with.",0
"The screen is bright, and the keyboard is solid despite the low travel and shift key, to which you will adjust to quickly.",0
"MSI has once again proven they are masters of their craft. The GL66 offers uncompromising performance in a case that is one of the nicest looking laptops I've seen on the market. If you want to run Battlefield, COD or Genshin Impact at max settings, this laptop will do it without dropping below 60 fps. Not only that, but if you are on the road, the battery life is typically about 2.5 hours while gaming if you select a lower battery usage level.All this being said, it is on the heavier side for a laptop if that is important to you. The mousepad is also considerably smaller than similarly priced laptops such as the Acer Predator.Overall, if you want the best deal on Amazon regarding a gaming laptop this would be your best bet.",0
"I am a computing enthusiast for more than 20 years. I had many laptops before. I love this laptop. Its performance, design, keyboard, screen, and everything else is very good.Only complaints I may say (1) its brightness controls are not perfect, and it can forget about your settings when it sleeps and wakes up, but it may be because I am not using any vendor software, I am using a clean Windows install. (2) Its brightness level is very good but it can be even more brighter. Still, I am happy even under sunlight.Other than that, I think this computer is a great choice and offers a great value for its price.",0
Love it so far! Very fast and lightweight,0
Hard to set up program and keeps updating after loading loosing information.,0
I bought this MacBook for a present for my son for Christmas. It will not charge and doesn’t turn on. Fortunately I purchased the AppleCare. But now I have to go to an Apple store to get a brand née product repaired. I find it amazing that Apple does not check their products before they go out the door. My son has been waiting for this Christmas present now has to wait four days after Christmas to go to an Apple store to get a brand new Apple MacBook repaired.,0
"It's a great weight, a great feel (aluminum case), and the specs are so great",0
This is the sorriest piece of crap I've ever had the displeasure of owning. Steer clear if this horrible product. A little over a year old and it's a paperweight. The crappy proprietary charging port is garbage. The picture is garbage. Just don't,0
This is s big improvement over the lap top we had!,0
Works Great,0
I didn’t like this computer because it not windows 10,0
"I purchased two of these for my twin 9 year olds for Christmas. We do not have a family computer and they need something for school. So far, so good. It seems like a good little laptop. It is definitely a bit smaller than a typical laptop but, perfect starter for kids!",0
"My family has several chromebooks and we have been happy with the older ones. They are light, affordable and start up quickly.This one has major issues with sound after only 1.5 months of use at home. There is very strong ""white noise"", no matter what headphones I plug in. And all the headphones work just fine with other devices.So, it is not very useful just after the return window closed.",0
keyboard feels a little flimsy when typing,0
Simple my old one died had it for six years. Replaced with this one ...larger screen is nice...you will love it,0
"It's not a bad computer for surfing the internet. However, I needed it for online college classes and the lockdown browser used by the university isn't supported by Chrome. My work software isn't support either, so I can't use it to work from home. It also doesn't support iTunes, which alone wouldn't have been a deciding factor for me, but if I can't do my schoolwork, career work, OR download music on my laptop, it's gotta go. Returned.",0
This is a great computer,0
Very happy. Great screen quality. Would reccomend,0
"This thing is great! I bought the 4GB model which will hopefully last me a few years but it's nice and snappy now. The 16GB of SSD storage is perfect as I use it for school and the biggest file I might be storing would be a picture. It integrates perfectly with my google account! This thing boots up super quick and it sleek and beautiful. It's lightweight, has a long battery life and although it's smaller than a standard laptop, the keyboard is easy to use.Google and partners have done great with Chromebooks and have plenty of features to accommodate. There are multiple physical keyboard shortcuts running along the top of the keyboard to quickly adjust settings. There are also several different hotkey menus which are accessed by keyboard combinations.The only thing I'm bummed about is the lack of Google Play. I'm still giving this thing 5 stars because the Play store should be released soon as it is already available on other Chromebooks.I would highly recommend this to anyone, but especially to someone wanting something that is affordable, easy to use and just a bit more than a tablet.UPDATE 7/21/17 - STILL ROCKSI've gotten more use out of this thing than I first envisioned. I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 and can easily access my Google Drive files that I create and edit on the Chromebook via Goggle Docs. It's still nice and snappy; I have Amazon Prime music running in one tab, working on a Google Docs file in another and browsing Reddit or searching something on a third tab and there's no hesitation. I've enabled the beta build and enjoy several Google Play Store applications. I added an SD card which has expanded on the 16GB of storage. I'm getting very used to the multiple finger shortcuts on the touch pad when navigating Chrome. For instance: putting 2 finger tips on the touch pad and swiping left or right will act as the forward or back button. Also, ""clicking"" on a link by using 2 fingers and pressing on the touch pad, you bring up a menu to open in a new tab among other things. I watch Netflix and HBO Now and can definitely notice the lack of 1080p but it's a ""get what you pay for"" situation, and I knew that going in. This thing is still fantastic for what it is. If you want a proper laptop then buy one -- this is a Chromebook. I'll be back to give another update in a few months.",0
This Mac is the fastest that I have had. Wakeup is instant. The fingerprint reader is exceptional. Screen quality is tops. Connectivity to external devices is simple and easy. Very satisfied,0
"I'm a PhD student and I was looking for a nice looking, long battery and lightweight laptop. I truly recommend this laptop.",0

"Una Laptop económica que cumple muy bien las expectativas, tiene las características de computadoras más costosas a menor precio. Se pueden andar juegos muy bien. No tiene ? pero ese no es problema al configurar el teclado en Espa?ol.",0
"I am blown away by the quality for the price of the laptop.Easiest computer I have ever set up. It leads you through the process and practically does it for you. With voice recognition, I think I typed in two passwords and then I was done.It used to take weeks, now it took less than an hour to set up. I was impressed.So far, it is quick and has handled everything I have thrown at it.It seems to run cool. I can put my hand under it and it is cool to the touch. Again, I am impressed.There is enough room on the platform to use a gaming cordless mouse without needing a mousepad on the side. That allows you to work and play on this computer just about anywhere.At this writing, I am very happy with it.",0
Great value to performance cost compared to other laptops. Has plenty of room to expand storage. Only dislike is the cover shows every fingerprint but you can live with that.,0
I got this for my husband. For the money it’s a great laptop.,0
"Let's call this laptop what it is.....basic and on the lower end. If you're into gaming or HD video editing or any other areas that require powerful hardware, this isn't the machine for you. I ordered it to take with me when I travel, just to do email and web surf on. It works well for that purpose.Be well aware though, that it does come with a paltry 4GB of RAM. Even for a lower-end laptop, that's pretty lame. Windows 10 just by itself will chew up about 2 GB. The first thing I did was to order an 8 GB stick and add it, giving me 12GB in total.To take the back off, just take out the screws (11 in total) and snap it off. The available slot where you can add RAM is obvious....I show it in one of the photos, one with it empty, and another one after the RAM was added. Interestingly, I didn't see the slot where the existing 4GB RAM was installed, so I'm guessing it must be somewhere beneath the circuit board.Also be aware that it only comes with a 128GB NVMe solid-state drive as the main hard drive, but it does have an available slot to add an internal 2.5"" drive. I happened to have a 480GB SSD on hand from an older laptop, so I wiped it clean and added it. I show the open slot where you can add a 2.5"" drive in one of the photos.The display is adequate, and is nice and large. If you are used to a 4K or even a 2K display though, which BTW I am, you are going to notice the difference. Weight-wise it is just over four pounds.....about what you'd expect from a laptop with a 15.6"" screen.To be honest, like most folks I really prefer full-featured computers with power to spare, which of course are quite more expensive than this unit, so I tried to keep its price-point in mind when evaluating its features. I really wouldn't want to use this laptop for my everyday use, but for the purpose that I ordered it for, to use when traveling, it will easily meet my requirements.As I use it more, if things change I will update this review. I hope it helped you to some degree, thanks for reading!",0
"I've yet to own another Apple silicon device since my 1.5 year venture into that sphere when the M1 Air was just introduced. I'b been considering getting the M1 Pro MacBook Pro 14 in recent due to lessons learned during my M1 Air ownership period.What's the main lesson learned? DO NOT purchase any base Apple silicon device. That is, 8GB RAM/256GB ROM is a definite NO-NO. For the 1st 6 mths you'll love it probably, but after that you're gonna be frustrated with how quickly the device will become storage and memory hungry. Mac OS does that. You're gonna love using the device so much for any and every computing task that you'll just wake up one day with an unpleasant surprise that you're gonna need a little more than what the base spec models offer with continued usage.Don't get me wrong, you'll love your Mac at the onset, just don't get the base specs if you want to keep that love affair going for the long haul.",0
When it arrived it already had issues of freezing for no reason.,0
The casing scratches easy on the outside- be wary.,0
"As a writer and editor, I need a real laptop, not a Chromebook. After looking at endless models from endless brands, I decided on a trusty Dell Inspiron. My previous Dell lasted 4 years with heavy usage before slowing down. I'm hopeful this laptop will perform even better. The speed is excellent and I have almost 200 GB of hard drive space still available after installing Office 365.It's also a great laptop for listening to music as the sound quality is clear and crisp. Some reviewers have complained about the screen quality, but I think its fine and actually prefer a slightly dimmer display. Bright computer lights give me a headache.The keyboard is excellent and allows me to type quickly and accurately. Overall, this is a serious work horse computer at a reasonable price.",0
"I completely understand this is a cheap laptop but it’s absolutely horrible. I got this laptop in Jan 2019 and now it’s Oct 2019. The screen just broke and it wasn’t because of misuse. The computer also was very slow and wasn’t was described on the details. If your looking to stream movies or videos, stay away from this laptop unless you enjoy waiting for the video to load or freeze up on you. If your thinking it’s my WiFi; wrong, my other devices I own don’t have this issue. Spend your money elsewhere.",0
Never seen a laptop with such a flimsy connector for the power supply. The port itself has been bent inside and literally have had two connectors snap off with very little pressure applied. Worst laptop design I've ever seen.,0
"Muy buena computadora, es exactamente lo que la descripción dice, Amazon hizo buen trabajo en la entrega, en perfectas condiciones y a tiempo, recomiendo comprar junto con una memoria externa de 2 tb my eliminar todas las apps preinstaladas que no se utilizarán ya que ocupan mucho espacio y es algo que le falta a la compu",0
"The display is crisp: Small text is clear, and the colors are full",0
Cant add apps,0
Cheap product but surprise me on the speed and battery. But monitor can be better,0
A gorgeous laptop with a nice screen and no Trackpad issue. However the fan noise goes load when processing Spyder and that didn’t happen in my old laptop which were bought 2years ago.,0
"Very easy to set up, fast, lightweight, operates well",0
"Es una computadora ligera, delgada, con un color muy bonito y llamativo, su monitor es de lo mejor, es antireflejo y no lastima la vista. El Windows 11 instalado me agradó, la rapidez es aceptable, no la he explotado al máximo pero creo que no me decepcionará.",0
everything is perfect and works well i highly recommended,0
"I bought this laptop a week ago was excited to try it out. Set it up and then one day later it wouldn't identify the WiFi. I tried network reset , reset adapter but nothing worked. Had to send it back. Don't buy this one. There is some problem with the WiFi adapter.",0
"Awful product, doesnt worth the moneyI have the laptop for 3 month and my experience is awfulApps crashing, sometimes extremely slow, and not to mention that i had to reset the laptop already because of the bad hardwareDO NOT BUY THIS",0
"Good laptops are hard to get a hold of, and this one was no different. Found it here and jumped on it for my son who is going into the ECE program and needed this level of performance.Good quality so far. Runs hot. A little on the heavy side but bearable. I worry the heat will eventually kill it before his college abuse does.",0
"The screen is vibrant with Full HD Widescreen , 14” viewing, and two speakers",0
"Loved the price.Battery life is very good. Also charges very quickly.It does everything I needed, I basically just wanted a web browser bigger than my phone with a physical keyboard. Using the chromeOS takes some getting used to but it’s simple really.It is lightweight.The screen and speakers seem like where they built to a price point. The colors of the screen are not vibrant and it definitely helps me see why Apple is so fond of their Retina display. The speakers sound tinny, no bass at all.Still, great value.",0
"Computer boots up in about 5 seconds, cold bootup to desktop.",0
It works amazingly. I have never had games download so fast.,0
"Plastic and not Aluminum like the previous model, speakers are weak and wifi is weak",0
"Presenta problemas de conectividad, no percibe se?al de wifi y toca reiniciarlo con el botón de encendido",0
"I am pretty blown away by his laptop. I had been using a Dell Inspiron 5755 (12 GB RAM) for years as my work computer, and this is a huge step up. I wish the screen was larger (15.1), but other than that. It is amazing. With 16 GB RAM it exceeds anything I need, and I imagine this would be a dream for a gamer, especially a teen, who would appreciate the lights on the keyboard more than I do. Easy set up. It is, also, surprisingly quiet. It is a bit pricey, but the performance is top notch so far.",0
"Las especificaciones son muy buenas, lamentablemente venia muy mal configurada y he batallado demasiado con ello. Ya can 3 reinicios de fabrica y Asus no cubre esos problemas porque son de software, he tenido que buscar ayuda con un técnico para poder reparar todos los problemas que trae, lo único que falta es que pueda detectar la cámara ya que a veces funciona y la mayoría de las veces no funciona. Fuera de eso es excelente su rendimiento y al correr los juegos (después de arreglar muchos problemas).Soporte técnico de Asus hace responsable a Windows.",0
"What amazon shipped me only has one USB-C type port, and it does not support Thunderbolt 3 - I tried it with multiple devices to no avail, and those devices did work with other TB3-enabled computers.I am returning mine, the description. for this needs to be changed.Oh, and lenovo tech support sucks. They wanted me to ship it to them, like I would want to spend more time trying to troubleshoot their incompetency.",0
"Writing for the gaming, but not gaming",0
"Great value, just what I was expecting!!!",0
Purchased for our son for online school. Great for after school is done he has his own gaming laptop. No issues at all so far with this model.,0
"Disappointed, received a used chrombook with a user account already configured, supposed to receive a brand new chromebook",0
"I rarely leave reviews for any products, but this is one I feel compelled to comment on. Within a few months of using this computer, it became progressively slower and would overheat when running more than 2 internet tabs. After a year, I was no longer able to use the computer for simple tasks such as a Zoom meeting. The battery life is also poor, and currently I cannot use the computer without it being plugged into a charger. I would highly recommend spending your money on a different laptop. I have since had to buy a new computer and I don't think I've ever regretted a purchase more than this computer.",0
cheap lop top,0
"I love it, easy set up, very fast",0
I love that its small and take it anywhere. Wow! I recommend everyone should get this.,0
I have used this laptop for school for 8 months now and it still works well. Starts up fast with zero issues. This laptop is good for regular school use.,0
I've never seen a screen so limited in brightness even in cheaper computers.,0
First one I received the laptop battery didn’t work properly,0
"Actually came sooner then expected, everything checks out good okurr.",0
I had an old MacBook Pro but decided to upgrade. Saw the many reviews pro and con but for what I use it for I am extremely happy with this laptop,0
"My teenage son is a big gamer and was constantly complaining about graphics quality, lag and disconnects with the previous system. This computer works great with none of those problems on these performance hungry games. It is a perfect size, light and portable and the killernetworks feature really helps online gaming performance. The graphics are awesome and it is cool looking too. I also wanted a good computer for him to take to college in another year, with plenty of storage and decent portability for its size. We haven't has many issues with Windows 10 as with previous PCs so I'm crossing my fingers. It has been a happy purchase so far.",0
A los cinco meses de uso dejó de prender la pantalla y me dijeron que se da?o la Mother board. Refieren que lo mejor es que cambie el equipo ya que la reparación no es posible :(,0
"Good points:1) Amazingly light!2) Nice size and fits in my backpack3) Useful if you are a student and need to transport it aroundBad points:1) Despite buying it on the amazon.com.au website and despite this being a Taiwanese model, it is made for a US market and ships from USA. Hence it comes with a US plug point and YOU NEED AN ADAPTER for use in Australia.",0
"Esta laptop funciona muy bien, un posible problema puede ser el espacio en disco duro, afortunadamente tiene un slot para agregar un hdd adicional, el disco que trae es ssd asi que toma de 15 a 20 segundos en encender totalmente. Tiene 8 gb de ram, hasta el momento funciona mejor que mi anterior HP i5 con 16 gb de ram ddr3.",0
"The laptop only lasted a day. It started displaying vertical red stripes (I guess it is either the graphics card or the screen). Another issue that the warranty activation date with Lenovo was giving me 10 month only , not a year which is strange on the new machine. Would not risk buying it again. I am waiting on the return to get processed , will update the review for the return process / refund.",0
"Okay I have been buying gaming laptop, and it seems this is finally is my last one because this gaming laptop is perfect.1. great graphic card: I can run most of the game on in with high setting for gaming, and for recent release game with a few change in settings game will work beautifully.2. it dose have it own key for performance, and CPU temp which is great.3. Ssd is fast and that is nice extra boost for running and loading games and software.4. the keyboard is smooth and have a nice sound when you push the keys.5. battery life is good too depend on what type of software you running and how much heavy work your doing with the laptop.the only down side part is that ssd is only 237 GB, so you will need the external hard drive.i dont recommend to replace the ssd because that might mess up acer care center which it will help you for recent update for graphic card, and the nitro key for your laptop performance.",0
"Tengo q admitir que al principio no estaba convencida del todo con esta laptop… pero a superado mis espectativas es súper rápida, la batería dura casi dos días. En tama?o pensé q se vería muy grande ya q tenía una de 14” pero la verdad es q casi no e sentido la diferencia el teclado retro iluminado funciona a la perfección cuando estamos en una área no muy clara… en fin creo q es una d ellas mejores compras q e realizado en Laptos 100% recomendada",0
Laptop is sooo bad and took forever to come just don’t buy this,0
"TL;DR: greatest qualities of this laptop: CPU, GPU, cooling solution, 144 Hz 5 ms response time display, keyboard, I/O ports placement, upgrade options. I.e. everything, LOL :DI was looking to build a mini-ITX desktop PC, and was targeting around 1500$ with monitor and peripherals. Then I suddenly came across the Ryzen chips and their shocking performance advantage w.r.t Intel mobile chips. This Legion 5 with a 45W Ryzen 7 4800H and an 80W 1660 Ti is an absolute beast of performance-per-watt metric.1) 4800H scores 4500 points in Cinebench R20 multi-thread. Just for reference, desktop Ryzen 7 3700X does 4800 Intel i7-10700K does 5300. For a mobile chip this is phenomenal.2) Lenovo did great job with cooling! Other laptops with 4800H have slightly lower score in sustained load. HP Omen and especially ASUS TUF laptop with their awful blocked air vents.3) 1660 Ti is full 80W, that means it is not restricted in performance. Moreover, it has a headroom for overclocking, I got +150 MHz on core, + 1000 MHz on memory with GPU max load temperature around 78 degC.4) The display is gorgeous. 144 Hz, 5 ms response time (with (!) Overdrive in Lenovo Vantage). It is just perplexing how this laptop in this price category includes such a jewel of a display.5) Keyboard is very nice too. I am comparing to Lenovo Ideapad 720S-15IKB laptop which has flat and shallow keys. Legion 5 in contrast has curved keys with much larger travel. Feels really great in long typing sessions.6) Upgrades, upgrades, upgrades. There are upgrades for: storage (NVMe + SSD or 2 x NVMe), RAM (up to 64 GB), Wi-Fi and even battery! This Legion 5 version has 60 Wh battery which allows to install secondary SSD. However you can order and install an 80 Wh battery which usually comes in Legion 7i. Secondary NVMe can be installed in any case, but it blocks the SSD upgrade.7) Ports! There are 4 x USB Type A, 1 x USB Type-C, HDMI and LAN. Such plenty of choice satisfies all laptop needs. Moreover, only 2 USB ports are on the sides, whereas everything else including charging port are on the rear side. It makes so much difference in cable management and access, such a great port placement decision!8) Finally, this laptop is more on the traditional side. It has webcam, it is on the top of the screen, numpad is present and has standard layout, Home/End/PgUp/PgDn buttons are primary and full-size, arrow keys are full-size in usual T-shape. Such a pleasure to use this laptop!9) Accessories. I purchased a TomToc laptop sleeve (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DLBJ4QD) which fits really nice! Also I got the Razer Gigantus V2 mouse pad Medium, which fits great in the sleeve.Thank you Lenovo!",0
It was great just to small for me and the only other thing is that it get hot a little easy. But besides that it is a great laptop,0
functions as expected!,0
The wifi is absolute garbage.,0
"I own an Asus G20 desktop and Asus PG279Q monitor from their ROG line. Both of which are solid performers - great quality, design, and build. I have also been a Mac user for decades and my go to everyday computer is a MacBook Pro. For work, I have a Lenovo X1 Carbon. All three I have no qualms in terms of what they offer and how they are built.Being a fan of Asus, I had I hopes for this M580VD-EB76 ViVoBook Pro. On paper the specs are top notch:- 2.8GHz Processor (Turbo up to 3.8GHz)- nVidia GTX 1050 graphics processor with 4GB DDR4 RAM- 256GB SATA3 M.2 SSD main hard drive- 1TB HDD secondary hard drive- Harman/Kardon audio- Multiple ports - USB 3.1, USB 3.0, USB 2.0, Headphone/Audio-in combo, HDMI 1.4, SDXC card readerThis is definitely more than a home/work computer as it's capable of avid gaming just short of fully meeting VR gaming specs.PROS:The Harman/Kardon audio is a win. It doesn't replace external speakers, but it's one of the best one's I've heard for one built into a laptop.The Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor doesn't hold back in performance unlike those specifically made for laptops.The nVidia GTX 1050 4GB graphics processor I can't complain although a GTX 1060 would have been ideal to meet VR gaming needs.SATA3 M.2 SSD cards plus additional traditional hard drive combo is the norm these days for primary and secondary storage.The ingenious wired Ethernet port design without having the need to purchase a USB to Ethernet adapter is definitely a great pro feature for this laptop.The keyboard has a great feel to it and is very quiet when typing.CONS:The keyboard feels too crammed I find myself pressing the nearby keys more often. And while the number pad is a good addition, again the crammed keys make me mis-press than what I have intended.The screen is a very poor performer. The colours are washed out and not vibrant. The anti-glare screen is giving me glare that I find myself having to adjust the angle all of the time. I'm definitely not loving the performance of this FHD with a TN panel. I wish Asus went IPS as adjustment from glare and the fact that you have a narrow viewing angle before it gets washed out.All I get is brightness without vibrance.Also the black bars on each side of the screen is too thick it makes this laptop look dated. Asus could have easily shaved an inch in width from this laptop so I wonder why they continued with this design especially having a crammed keyboard when there is still so much width to play around with doesn't make sense. It appears more of a cost issue than to retool their equipment.Opening the lid isn't a smooth feature. Unlike Macs where you can simply lift the lid open, the main body doesn't lift up. With this Asus, you have to hold your hand down on the main body as it will lift up together when opening the lid. Not exactly a good pro design.For a VivoBook Pro notebook, having been provided Windows 10 Home instead of Pro is a big miss.The trackpad isn't also a stellar performer. It's not as sensitive as I am used to from other laptops including MacBooks.Like all manufacturers there are too many bloatware installed. Even after set up, the Asus software gives you a chance to install even more ""recommended"" free software.Finally the metal body feels cheaply made unlike the metal feel of a Mac. With the Asus it feels thin that I have to double guess if it's plastic than aluminum. So while the lid and body are metal, the underbody is disappointingly plastic. The feel is completely different and feels like another shortcut in cost and quality.OVERALLFor what it is and the price, you really can't complain. But for a manufacturer like Asus I would have expected a whole lot more in terms of quality of components and materials as well as design.The box of this laptop bills itself as a VivoBook Pro, but I don't quite see the ""pro"" aspect of it apart from impressive specs on the inside with so-so execution on the outside.",0
"What am I writing this review on... this bad boy you're looking at now. For the price, I like it! It gets my 2 thumbs of approval for the price. I really like the Chromecast setup myself, beautify of a screen, great battery life, and fairly fast * 4gb RAM *. Only draw back.... the keyboard is very hard to see at night time, no backlighting or assistance there. You know what tho, that's all right, for the price!I do college stuff on this.I do many other professional things on it too!Also, I like youtube videos and movies which come in great. Many ports on the sides.",0
"As you can see from numerous amount of other reviews on this specific lap top, the battery isn't exactly the best, despite it being an lithium battery. However despite this downfall, its specs and capability is incredible. You can't play games without plugging it into power, but when it has enough power, it is a beast to be reckon with. RTX 2070 + intel core 10750 is just amazing. Well here are some statistics from valorant. 240 Max FPS(uncapped), 89 degrees C CPU temp. 144 Max FPS (capped) 80 C degrees. With coolerBoost of course. The fans are a bit loud but that is something you have to deal with. If you want coolerBoost on of course. If you don't want it on, it is silent... usually. Overall a good buy for $1400 dollars. Worth your money. Recommended",0

"An absolute waste of money. Operates the same as a tablet, and is unable to accomplish the most basic tasks. I am so angry that I wasted money on this piece of trash. Just found out that I missed the return window by 3 days, and after contacting Samsung, they are unable to take it as a return as well. Very tempted to just light it on fire since I clearly won't be getting my money back, just for the satisfaction of watching this headache burn. Bought it as a Christmas gift to myself, since I haven't had the funds to purchase a computer (and have lived without one for the last 3 years) and wishing I had just flushed my money down my toilet instead, as that would have been more satisfying than trying over, and over, and over again to navigate such a ridiculously worthless and ineffective operating system. If you are buying this product for every-day tasks, such as; printing, navigating web pages, playing games, etc., look elsewhere. Just about the only thing this Chromebook is good for, is checking your e-mail.",0
"Chromebooks do not work as advertised. Please do not buy!! It is worth paying more for a macbook. I bought my chromebook to do very simple things. I wanted to listen to spotify and browse the internet. IT DOES NOT WORK FOR THAT. IT DOES NOT EVEN WORK ON GOOGLE PRODUCTS LIKE YOUTUBE. PLEASE DO NOT BUY. THIS IS A SCAM. THE CHROMEBOOKS DO NOT WORK. It literally cannot browse the internet. I am refunding this product and want to help other customers avoid the insaneness that is the chromebook.Even with all its known limitations like you can't download anything or use non-google products, it still does not even do the simple browsing of the internet. PLEASE DO NOT BUY",0
"Does what I need a laptop to do. I miss touch screen, but I knew I was giving that up for price.",0
"My Windows laptop died and I didnt have time to research too thoroughly. Read the initial reviews, one which name-dropped my beloved long-stolen Acer netbook, and thought this sounded perfect: Portability, long battery, ""zippy"" one reviewer called it. And it was indeed zippy as it fired right up and my fingers adjusted to the soft, compact keyboard. Quickly I realized the problem: Google operating systems are not compatible with Microsoft Programs. yes, there are ""add ins"" like band-aids to access Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Access, etc but I need the ability to work offline and MS Office cannot be downloaded on Chromebook. Two years of projects on Microsoft programs and I couldnt work on them. Other programs I use frequently were incompatible with the OS too. Spent two hours online with tech support but in the end, I had to pack this adorable little netbook back up in the box and return it.",0
"This is for the 2022 model which has some serious upgrades on specs from the earlier model. First, you are dealing with a 10 core chip, and not the underpowered 4 core i7, so that is substantial. This was always a weak link in the prior version. You are also dealing with 16gb ddr 5 (not 4) ram, so that is both more and faster but note that upgrading ddr5 ram will be more expensive than upgrading a ddr4 machine so you may have to wait for ram prices to fall a bit before upgrading.THERE IS A VIDEO CAMERA!! The old version did not have it. Is it a great camera? No, but it will work fine for zooms. The hard drive is on teh small side at 500G but these are easy to upgrade (a 1 TB costs about 100 bucks and is easy to install).The looks are clean and efficient without looking to ""gaming"" but the charging brick is still a brick which effects some portability. But in all, by spec, this is a solid gaming machine.",0
Needed a laptop with more capabilities for school and it fits the bill I haven’t had no issues with it and it works great and fast.,0
"I only kept it a short time, but only because it's size. It was too big for my taste, but a good size for husband.",0
"Great laptop, handles big Triple A games like Call of Duty, New World, Fallout 4, etc. I bought a full sized keyboard, mouse, and a 24 inch monitor to game on with the laptop powering the setup and providing a second monitor for me to watch media.",0

"Excelente para jugar y transportarla a todos lados, muy contentó con la compra",0
"Im not a tech person so i had to google a few things as far as how to do things on this laptop (copy/paste, scroll using the mouse pad..heck i didmt even know it had touchscreen until this review). Im on the laptop long enough to do my homework (3hours) havent had a battery issue though. So far so good.",0
"My family needed a multi-purpose laptop and Acer's Nitro 5 fits the bill. It's design is sleek (although it is fairly big) and it looks really nice with the red backlit keyboard. Although, I find a backlit keyboard is an unnecessary battery drain. It's simple to toggle the keyboard light off and on. The screen resolution is great for our needs. I've been doing telework since Covid-19 and I don't need tons of bells and whistles, just something reliable and safe. Norton Antivirus is included on the Nitro 5. It is easily upgradeable if you need more memory. Battery life is good (especially if you turn off the back light).My children need a computer for home-schoolwork and the Nitro 5 fits the bill for them as well. I realize this is marketed as a gaming laptop, and we may or may not use it for gaming. It's a good beginner gamer laptop and at this price point, it has been a good value for us. It only needed a Microsoft account to activate and use and it was ready to go right away.",0
Waste of money. Bought this for my son’s distance learning and audio functions are not compatible with video platforms such as Zoom.,0
it only comes with 16gb single channel ram and cause of that fps in manu games are lower than expected around (10-20 fps) low,0
Use for fun/ Quality great.,0
"Acer, Aspire 5 laptop is a great improvement over the HP laptop that I replaced. It is fast and streams movies and TV shows easily without all the pauses to reload. I didn't realize what I was missing hanging onto my old laptop, but I am glad that I finally replaced the old HP with a newer, more efficient model.",0
This is an excellent Chromebook. I LOVE everything about it. Mine came with a black keyboard. Highly Recommend.,0
What a horrible product. Got the laptop and would not even turn on all the way. Screen would blink and laptop would shut down.,0
"Good morning I bought this laptop on 30-11-2018 and I received it on 05-12-2018, very happy with the purchase, the laptop is beautiful and very light weight. But since the 1st day I have had problems, where it freezes every time there is an application and sometimes never reacts again, also since the first day of use heats up when I open 2 applications, for example google Chrome and then Skype . Or if I open an Excel Sheet and open the Firefox browser and it stays frozen, it gets too hot and it stops working. I'm getting blue screens when it freezes and gets very hot. These blue screen I'm getting daily! This is not OK!!! It is worth mentioning that from day 1 I left connected to the internet, updating windows, updating the antivirus, check the drivers with the Asus tool to see if there was a new one, and only got a new driver for the WIFI card and audio. It is worth mentioning that I am a medium / advanced user in computers, work in technology and this is not normal in a new laptop, just removed from the box. I wrote this comment from my old laptop because it is impossible to work with the Asus UX331UA. What a disappointment!!!! Note, I attach some blue screenshots and I can mention that I have placed an open source tool to measure the temperature and recently turned on sample between 42 ° - 45 °, when I open 1 or 2 applications, such as Firefox or Chrome browser (Only 1 of them) And Excel or Photos or Zimbra Mail the temperature is triggered at 75 ° - 78 °. I tried to place a Fan Cooler tray and really the difference of temperature peaks go down 1 ° or 2 °. I have also tried the Quiet Fan tool that comes by default and I have left it in ""Disabled"" mode because in this way, I hear the fancooler of the computer working at full power, but even so, while working (40 miuntos - 1 hour) reheats and freezes for a few minutes and crash - blue screen. I have the computer on a completely flat surface (My work desk).",0
"I bought this laptop and didn't feel like I should review it until buying a similar product, because the HDMI port was malformed and I could not attach my Mixed Reality headset.I have succeeded in attaching my headset to a different laptop, so I know it wasn't user error. The laptop itself is fast, hot, and blew me away at how fast it installed Unity3D and related dev tools. Should it have had a working port, I would've kept",0
extrimly happy with screen quality and it preformance,0
Interesting keyboard lighting options and sufficient hardware to run the games I like.,0
The low bezel screen looks gorgeous and feels solid.,0
ALL WE EVER ASKED FOR,0
"I’m a very light computer user, so the quality of everything meets/exceeds my expectations! The screen looks pretty large to be a 13” laptop. Definitely well made",0
so nice,0
"Before buying this laptop, I searched online for one month and finally decided to get this one. It was perfect for me. It's quiet, super responsive and light. I've seen ppl complaining about the delte and power button being next to each other. It wasnt a problem for me as I rarely mispress the power button for delete. Even if I do, you just need to press the power button again and it will turn back on quickly.",0
The programs crashed while loading and most importantly and offensively the computer LAGGED OUT ON a game that has hardly any demand!!!,0
"Absolutely love the laptop. It's been close to a year now that I have been using the latop. One of the best one's I have owned till date. Really changed my perception of Asus as a company. Will make the decision again. Great battery life, quick and sleek.",0

"This Chromebook was fine at first. It was an adjustment to do the initial switch (moving from having lots of files stored on a PC to suddenly going cloud-only for everything), but that was expected. And it was a hassle to learn how to print and scan documents, but eventually, that got sorted out, too. But all of a sudden one day, after owning it for 7 months, the computer just wouldn't start up anymore. One day it worked; the next day, it didn't. Now we have to pay to have someone diagnose the problem and tell us how expensive it will be to fix. I really expected the laptop to last longer without a major problem like this.",0
The worst laptop in my life. In three month stopped works battery and then stopped works adapter. I can't download any apps and many other things. I highly not recommended to buy this junk.,0
"I use this for work and it's great. As a graphic designer, it has more than enough room to hold all my files.",0
excellent! lightweight.,0
"The Nitro 5 feels like a quality laptop. It feels perfect for a slightly above entry level gaming laptop. The only complaint and why I didn't give it 5 stars, is it runs pretty hot. I recently replaced the stock thermal paste with high quality paste meant to handle even extreme setups. It brought the cpu temp down about 8°. Diablo 3, The Witcher 3, FFXIV, etc.. All runs at a decent temp on higher settings. FFXV turns my Nitro into a supernova at medium settings even with the new thermal paste (will frequently spike to 93°-96°). Other than that it'll play any new game on the market at medium graphics with a decent fps and it'll play most games at medium to max settings at a good fps. I'd recommend replacing the stock thermal paste asap.All in all, for the price I would highly recommend this laptop. Just don't expect to be playing something like Cyberpunk higher than medium with anything higher than 30-40 fps.",0
"Have had the laptop a few months now and works great for streaming movies, surfing the web, simple graphic games, and everything I need it for. Runs fast and so far it’s been well worth the buy.",0
I haven't bought a new computer in years. I wanted something that I could use for business but if u felt like playing a game I could keep up with the latest games out there. This was a great platform to choose. Now I did personally upgrade the ram to 32 from 16 and I installed 2 more drives as well.,0
Like everything about it.,0

"Initial review, will update after a few months: Liking this little Chromebook so far, paired a bluetooth mouse to it easily, and it's keyboard isn't bad at all. No fancy mechanical gaming keyboard, but it feels fairly durable. I usually use headphones with music, but tried out the speakers on this anyways and was pleasantly surprised. They're pretty good considering the cost of this Chromebook.",0
"Set up and start up were simple and easy. The settings for adjusting the keyboard lights are very simple to understand and operate. The build quality is sturdy and robust. I am primarily using this computer for office work, browsing and streaming videos and this system does so quickly and with ease. Unlike what other reviewers have said, I do not notice any excessive noise with the fan, but the computer and charger does get warm when operating. I would absolutely recommend this computer if you're looking for a well-priced and fun machine!",0
"It died in 2020, not a long lived machine that had a cushy life. Was almost never moved or subjected to any upset. Sent impending doom message once, then died.",0
"Purchased this in November 2018. Laptop was working fine then the touch screen feature stopped working. After googling the problem, trying out some of the solution, nothing worked. In the Lenovo forum, seems like a common problem. Many experienced the support was not helpful. I bought this laptop for the touch screen feature. I'm disappointed.",0
Everything works amazing. Although choice of camera has very low quality.,0
Amazing laptop for the price! Nice keyboard as well. Very happy,0
"I got this to replace a 9 year old HP PavilionPros:1. You get a high quality gaming laptop for a good price.2. Lightweight3. Good Speakers4. Great Screen Quality5. I run Overwatch at Ultra and average 110 FPSCons1. Bloatware. I know unavoidable but really annoying that I have to go through uninstalling Norton and other preinstalled crapware2. Fan gets really loud when running games. I normally have headset on so I don't hear it much but if anyone else is around they will hear it3. The top section of the laptop between the screen and keyboard gets very hot while gaming4. The other day my keyboard stated to get a little warm while playing Overwatch, but it didn't do it other times. Hoping it was a one time thing5. Would like some more USB ports6. USB placement to me is weird. They are towards the front of the laptop. It's awkward because I feel they should be towards the back but I am aware that most laptops now have them all towards the front now7. Battery life sucks, but its a gaming laptop so to be expected. Make sure you use the Dragon Center Battery management to help keep the battery aliveOverall so far this is a great buy and I do recommend it",0
"Estaba feliz de poder volver a comprar una ASUS, y si bien la calidad de la batería es óptima, el diseño es hermoso, la velocidAd está muy bien, falla el teclado y no funciona la Tecla T. La verdad es que no sé qué hacer porque la necesito para trabajar.",0
I like the notebook very much. It is so much faster than my old lap top. The only negative is that the touch pad is a little to sensitive.,0
A great computer for the price.,0
Perfect laptop for our son,0
"The keyboard is amazing, the screen quality is great, it can be folded into a tablet easily which is great,It also performs very well.Highly recommended.",0
"Excellent gaming laptop. Was available for $1,400, which is a great value for the sum of its parts.Gaming - this is what its for. The 2070 RTX card benchmarks at around the previous gen's 1080 GTX, although it's supposed to have optimized support for ray-tracing (I've not seen that yet, don't have any games that have that feature). The 10th gen i7 is a slightly better version of my 7th gen i7, which 6 cores instead of four. in short, this is a slightly better computer than my 3 year old gamer rig only its way more mobile. It's not a Switch, you'll have to plug in the laptop to get the most out of modern games, but it's perfect when it's plugged in.You'll want a gaming mouse, a headset, and a controller to go with this. If you have a second monitor, I'd recommend a G-sync or FreeSync monitor to make sure you're not letting any of those precious frames go to waste.Nitpicks -Speakers are quiet, fan is loud. When the fan is blasting, it becomes difficult to hear what's going on in the game. Can't do much about the fan - you've got to cool the GPUs and CPUs. They could have made the speakers a bit louder, or maybe they could have placed them in a better position. It's a minor gripe, just wear a headset.",0
"Had this a few years , but only used it may 6 or 7 times as I don’t need to use a laptop very often as you can see , but this thing takes a good 20 minutes just to start up.",0
HDD low qualityVery slow,0
Would give 4.5 if I could. I love the computer just had to replace the charger 3 times. It keeps breaking… that’s the only con I have.,0
"The illuminated keyboard can have its color changed, as a cool thing",0
Very happy with this computer. Have not had an issue with any games so far.Runs smooth. Works great. Sound output seems a little low to me at max volume.,0
"The good: very speedy, silent, the midnight color is beautiful (more like a dark gray).The bad or not great:The display is just odd, I can't stand the ugly notch, it's a distraction and doesn't even offer Face ID! Windows laptops have had that for many years now, without a big ugly cut out that feels like it is spying on you with no manual privacy lid (like ThinkPads have for example). Also it is too glossy and reflective, would much prefer a matte anti-glare screen option. The display resolution quality is great, but not as great as the 14"" MacBook Pro.The keyboard is OK but shallower than the 14"" MacBook Pro. It feels like I am bottoming out when typing with my natural amount of pressure.The speakers/sound are also just OK. Definitely not as good as the MacBook Pro's speakers which have a better system like up/front speakers, this one sounds like they are only coming from the bottom of the laptop.The weight is a little heavier than I thought. Honestly it is a negligible difference between the MacBook Pro and Air.I will wait for the 14"" MacBook Pro with the M2 chip and Midnight color.",0
Great Quality!,0
the pen holder takes up a USB port and blocks other ports.,0
Bought this for my daughter so she stopped stealing my computer. Great for what she uses it for (basic school stuff and internet surfing). Great starter computer.,0
The screen is great,0
"The hardware is sleek, and I was unexpectedly happy with the RGB backlit keyboard\lid.",0
"The laptop itself was fine, except for the terrible flaw that seems rather common of this model. Its fan sounds like its bearing was broken and has a grinding/rattling sound.",0
"Two weeks after I received the Chromebook, the charger stopped working. I had to contact Samsung & they replaced it. Now, 2 months later it keeps dropping the internet connection. This Chromebook is a piece of junk and no one wants to stand behind it. Never again.",0
"I needed a laptop with a decent battery life, and room for upgrade. Mostly for office work and media consumption. Web surfing needed, strong wifi, I wanted S mode for security. I wanted access to office.com for document use. I wanted decent audio too. The laptop I got provided all of that. The audio at 100 percent was adequate for media, but my Bluetooth speaker works better. I can still hear it fine without the Bluetooth. I charged the laptop to 100 percent and watched a series, I like, for three hours before it reached 50 percent. So, for media consumption at full brightness gave me plenty of battery. I think I could get a total of five- or six-hours watching movies. I charged it back up from 50 percent to 100 percent in two hours while I watched more series episodes. I keep the touch pad turned off all the time. I never use it, because I prefer a wireless mouse. The laptop is about the size of my 14-inch Chromebook. This laptop, however, is more powerful. So far, I am pleased with this purchase. This would not be suitable for gaming or video editing, but I use my desktop for those things. I recommend this laptop for the things I've mentioned and the low price. The laptop I bought has the following specs.Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-32DK Slim Laptop was delivered in two days. Core I3, 4gb ram, 128gb NV Me SSD, empty bay for hard drive upgrade. 15.6 display full HD IPS. With Windows 11 S mode. Cost was $308. Delivered by Amazon Driver. I didn't give a rating for touchscreen or gaming, because they do not apply.",0

"This laptop was a complete waste of money. When I received my item I was very anxious to set it up, upon setting it up I realized this computer had been used before. Someone else’s emails and passwords were saved. The navigation pad did not work. Only the keys did. This laptop kept freezing and programs would fail. Don’t buy this.",0
"I gave it a 4 out 5 rating because of price and battery life while gaming. If you plan on gaming, which it's a gaming laptop, I would strongly suggest to leave it plugged in. Battery life is shorted than I expected.",0
I got this for my nephew for Christmas ! I was very surprised with the quality especially since I didn’t spend that much money on it ! I love it! I hope he loves it as well,0

The materials quality and everything on it looks fascinating.Last but not least, just because of this feedback, ASUS is giving us a 90 days warranty extension.The brand is rocking!!!?",0

"I had high hopes because I didn’t see the reviews until after I made the purchase. At that point I could only hope I wouldn’t have the same Wi-Fi issues that most other people had complained about. But sure enough, the 2nd day, after the laptop installed updates, I could not get it to connect to wifi anymore. I rebooted and tried to fix it for a little while but after reading the reviews I tried no more troubleshooting as I already knew what to expect but just hoped for a different outcome. Sending the laptop back immediately and I will just go and purchase one in store that I won’t have to troubleshoot on day two. Do not waste your time with this laptop unfortunately. And to think this was on the “Treasure Truck” but there is no treasure here.",0
"Well first, arrived on time. 2nd it's a worth the price and have been enjoying this laptop....no problem so far. Also I read a lot of reviews about adding more memory since I'll be gaming and purchased some Ripjaws 2 x16 . Battery is ok but it would be better if it lasted more than 5hrs ....even so it's not that big of a issue for me. Overall I'm happy with this laptop.",0
"Good price, purchased just to be backup computer in case of trouble with primary computer.",0
it is very portable being less than 5lbs.,0
"My last laptop, an HP, died a drowning death from hot coffee with chocolate, doh. As I liked the size, weight, I wanted something similar, but with a little more ""oomph"" to it.The Ryzen 5, 4 core/8 thread cpu with the Radeon Vega graphics fit the bill nicely. The price was right, and I've had good experience with the Ryzen cpus. I also liked the upgradability, you can add another (2 slots, one used) 8 GB stick of RAM and an M2 SSD. There is a screw in place for the M2 SSD.I received the laptop in a sealed box and in brand new condition.I first started it up with the original 1 TB HDD. Once I was satisfied it was all well, I installed a WD 500 GB M2 SSD, reinstalled windows to the M2 drive, and will use the 1 TB HDD for a backup drive. Perfect. Startups are now much quicker as are shutdowns. There is no beating an SSD for a boot drive.There are instructions on the internet for taking this thing apart, and I found it wasn't near as hard as previous HP laptops I've worked on. In 30 minutes I was back together and installing Windows. 30 minutes later with some drivers installed, I now have a much faster computer. It is responsive, the display, though only 15 inches, is crisp and more than adequate for the job. The keyboard, like any 15 inch laptop, is small and takes getting used to. But the keys are crisp enough to feel.I installed Civilization 6, and it runs quiet well on lower graphic settings. So for light gaming and internet use this laptop will do fine. I like the smaller size and weight. The power brick is small. I've had previous laptops that were like carrying around a bowling ball. Not this lightweight portable unit.No cons, it is what it is, a low priced, yet upgradable laptop that is surprisingly powerful.When I reinstalled Windows 10, I installed the HP Support Assistant software, it will find and help install any drivers needed.EDIT: 8/4/19I added another stick of 8 GB Ram for only $38.99. Samsung 8GB Notebook Memory M471A1K43CB1-CRC DDR4-2400 SODIMM 8GB44 is an exact match to the original Ram. Having two sticks of Ram allows the laptop to run in Dual Channel mode further increasing performance, which for the price of the Ram these days, is hard to beat.The WD 500 GB SSD was $59.99 and the extra Ram was only $38.99, so for a little under $100, worthy upgrades, I now have a laptop that not only has lots of storage, is very peppy, starts very quickly, shuts down almost instantly. Many laptops with M2 SSD drives, come in only 128 GB size and why I went this route as I prefer a bigger boot drive.I hear a lot of complaints that the display isn't 1080p. Why this is a problem I don't know. It is a 15 inch display, IMO this size of display does not need 1080p resolution. It looks just fine. FWIW, I feel 1080p is good for 17 inch or bigger displays only.",0
"I decided to take a chance with MacOS and the at the time of purchase discounted Macbook Air. At first, I liked it a lot and was very impressed. However, over time, I quickly grew to dislike how strict MacOS is with installing things like an overbearing parent. While I personally didn't find this to be the laptop of choice, I cannot deny the excellent screen, insane battery life and great keyboard. The usage of the Macbook Air is too limited for what I use computers for, but for people with more basic needs or that use productivity apps constantly, it's an excellent selection. It just wasn't the all-rounded I had hoped it would be.",0
Buena Laptop!! Tiene buen sonido es rápida aun que la nitidez de la pantalla le falta.,0
"This laptops case is poor, thin and built incorrectly for women to see. Only the top of the case is proper.It feels like naked or too wide and made for video only.The keyboard is not good for games. It sticks at a bad ratio, and does not load 3D up to date.On the other side the 5 month payment for disability/welfare people or temporary work statements from disability is not good.1. food runs out of the house with over 100 dollar payments for 5 months2. pets become poor if they need food, dental or house care.3. medicine is only possible to buy at a low rate.4. wrong or poor choices can be made out of the ratio of SSI because of under throughput.The quadpay hangs with like a 160-170 overcast for 4 months instead which is on paypal on other sites like newegg.com or staples.comThey did not put the right model on this site with acumen as the pavillions are missing.",0
"I was s happy with this laptop. It's extremely fast for video editing, streaming, gaming and it has a very stylish design.But after a week it started freezing and crashing. Showing the dreaded Blue Screen of death. I have done everything, update drivers, factory resets and nothing works.Apparently Lenovo has some issues with some Windows 10 Ver 1909 updates and the computer ended up being useless as it crashes every 10 minutes or so.Really disappointed as I had a Lenovo years ago and blindly trusted the brand.",0
"It's smaller than my last one, so it fits my cooling board. I love that the keyboard can change color. The screen has no glare which is amazing. Never had a laptop that didn't have glare. My games look fantastic, it's almost like starting a new game. I haven't done a lot with is yet, but its worth the money. Very happy I didn't go with the other laptops I was looking at. This is by far the best one I have owned. I love how loud it can get. My last laptop even with the sound all the way up I can't hear the games or shows. Very happy with this laptop. It loads things very fast which is nice. It's much lighter than my last one, so it's easier to move around. Not big and bulky. Very excited to have this. It has an extra fan you can turn on and off if it gets hot as well.",0

"This has all the bells and whistles of a $1000 laptop. I love the SSD which powers up and gets you going. The only annoying thing which I discover buying computers on Amazon is the need, in this case, to call HP customer support because the computer went to dark screen as soon as it booted up. The problem: In the eleven months this set on a shelf, it missed several software updates. Fifteen minutes later all was good. And HP extended the warranty one year because only 14 days remained on the original. Thank you, HP. If you can stand such inconveniences, a really great deal.",0
Had this 2 days and already know I will need another laptop soon. it is NOT as advertised and is slower than my 20 year old tower. Over all quite dissatisfying.,0
"Great looking laptop. Soft keyboard. Great screen. The only thing good about the laptop are the aesthetics. I got this laptop to replace the one I have at work which was starting to run extremely slow so I'm expecting it to crash any moment. I wasn't going to put too much $$ into a work laptop but I did expect the basic and good speed. I should have taken heed at the negative reviews regarding the speed of this laptop. One guy said it's like being on dial-up again. He's not that far off. This laptop is incredibly slow. Just typing this review up to this point the keyboard froze twice. $300 is a lot of $$ for a single, slightly middle income person to spend. I should have paid attention to the reviews and spent the extra $100 for a higher quality machine. At least for my hard earned $$ I'd be able to enjoy the experience. Bottom line. Horrible, horrible laptop.",0
"So far it’s worked pretty well for the last 2 days in regards to drafting in AutoCAD’s Civil3D 2020. I don’t game at all but after a couple recommendations by others who have used similar gaming laptops with a hexa core intel i7 processorS, 16GB or more of RAM & NVIDIA GTX 1660 series card I figured I would give it a try. 15.6” screen is a little smaller for drafting which a cheaper wireless mouse. Fans kick up speed occasionally when I’ve built a DEM surface with a lot of definition. But definitely a nice machine so far for AutoCAD Civil 3D usage. Should something change in my experience I’ll update later",0
"I spent hours looking for an affordable laptop with a long battery life. I would only recommend it for light use. Otherwise don't buy it.The Battery:It only lasts all day if you use the battery saving feature. It cannot run moderately intensive programs while on this.On the bright side, it hasn't degraded much compared to other batteries.The Software:It randomly shuts down once a month. Luckily it's 2020 and every program saves itself, but wow it's annoying.Random websites and programs don't work for me, while they work for other PC and mac users.Sound:I'm not picky about sound but this is too quiet. I often have to use earbuds even if my laptop is right in front of me.",0
No touchscreen but has just about every thing else. Needed a laptop for my Cricut machine as my old one just couldn’t handle the demand. Works perfect.

"Great computer! I just bought this computer from Walmart. Pavilion is always a good line of HP computers. It has a backlit keyboard with options, and I love the thin metal, but good quality feel of this machine. I have to have a dependable computer for online college and this is it! It has a fingerprint security on the side. The WiFi never cuts out for me. Be careful though bc all hp computers are prone to over heat so always use on a flat surface. This computer has battery conservation features as well as security features that make me so glad I spent the money. The warranty with HP is also wonderful. I thought about buying a Mac book air. But the price and all of the special adapters I’d need and risks of issues with Microsoft made me hold off for now. It’s a trustworthy computer for a college student.",0
"I noticed that this laptop had a 10-key panel, and that's why I purchased this. However, I have since discovered that it is a very very condensed version of a 10-key. It it not a standard ASCII keyboard. If you do data entry for a living, you will HATE this laptop just based on that feature alone. Shame on me for not discovering it before I purchased it, and shame on them for not disclosing it in the item description. I'm gonna add the extended warranty and then take this thing for a swim in the hot tub",0

"Excellent computer for the price. Consider this recommended specs for a successful windows 10 experience in my opinion. The hardware inside hits all the requirements for a good windows laptop without overkill parts. Since buying this similar spec laptop with an SSD costs hundreds $$$ more (Something is wrong with our laptop market), I did a $60 dollar separate SSD upgrade and this machine is more than twice as fast as the original. Highly recommended for those that are capable.",0
"I think this would be a great machine if mine weren't defective. It's been blue screening since I got it. Finally found out that it has bad ram. Was going to reseat the ram to make sure it wasn't just in wrong, but this laptop doesn't give you easy access to it. Now I have to send it back to the manufacturer and pay for my own shipping to get something fixed that was bad from the factory. Not impressed with the customer service for sure, but the laptop, when not getting a blue screen is an absolute beast. Knocking a star off my review for the issue I'm having and the bad warranty policy.",0

"I actually was able to get this laptop through an Amazon warehouse deal for $900 (i7 16gb RAM and GTX 1050 4gb) due to the item merely being repackaged so it was a steal. After using it exclusively for 3 months for everything, here are my thoughts.Pros:-Looks and feels amazing, very thin and portable.-Has a really nice backlit keyboard.-Boots very fast due to SSD having OS.-The extra 4gb of vram in the GPU come in handy.-Edits videos extremely well due to the i7.-Played all my games just fine on high settings.-Speakers are awesome.Cons:-The screen is lackluster but not too bad.-The laptop scratches and dings VERY easily.-The laptop will run very hot and rather loud under load, however I’ve NEVER had it shut down on me due to overheating. It’s ran under full load for hours upon hours on end. Be sure to have on hard flat surface for good airflow.-Battery life is pretty bad due to the high performance components inside and the battery not being very big.Overall in my opinion the pros outweigh the cons big time here. I was going on a trip for a few months out of the country and needed a laptop that could play games and edit videos well. Safe to say I am not disappointed in the slightest. I love this laptop and would highly recommend!",0
"This laptop does exactly what I need it to. Nothing fancy, just bought it for online classes and nothing more. Money well spent. I recommend this product for simple tasks.",0
"Purchased laptop for a Christmas present, used it twice to create documents using Microsoft word, third time we turned it on and the hard drive crashed, I am a HP fan but very disappointed this time.",0
Great small computer and does what I need it to do,0
Arrived in perfect condition,0
the control center panel is quite confusing,0
"Very nice machine. Fast. A little on the noisy side but it is a gaming laptop, win some lose some. I like that it has an extra m.2 slot and an open SATA ssd bay. Did not like mine came loaded with Windows 11 instead of Windows 10 like stated on the purchase page but I'm just being picky. Sa far as performance it's good enough for almost any game. This will run ( for me at least ) Crisis 3, Witcher 3, Doom Eternal, Portal 2 and Universe Sandbox 2 on max settings and maintain 60fps (as high as my tv goes) with no issues except for the eventual fan noise. Even has a button to turn the fans to full speed on command. I have run Novabech to get some real numbers and the results place the performance of my laptop between the upper level of midrange gaming desktops and entry-level high end gaming desktops. So, I'm satisfied with the purchase.",0
"In terms of performance this laptop is great. However, the battery life is so poor that it defeats the purpose of having a laptop !It takes a while to charge but then from just using chrome and microsoft word I'm lucky to get 2 hours out of a full charge. For this reason I give it 3 stars. I get that grunty laptops require a lot of power but surely there's merit in giving it a better battery?The kicker is that the ""battery saver"" mode actually drains the battery quicker when on that it does when it's off !!!?I purchase laptops as I quite often have to travel for my business so for this reason I will not be purchasing a Lenovo again. I would be better off just carrying around my desktop with me.",0
"I tried to contact them 2 times by phone, 3 times trough chat and 7 times trough e-mail and no acknowledge of a problem, estimate on when my laptop will be sent back or anything else.",0
"Very disappointed because the Windows operating system uses 22G of the 32G storage ""available!"" Then other Microsoft and Dell junk programs eat up another 4G so by the time I added Adobe reader and a few files I am getting a message I am almost out of storage. So don't be fooled like me thinking 32G is plenty of storage!!!!!! Maybe I missed the fine print??? I don't know why they would sell a system with this setup. Just makes the customer unhappy....",0
Amazing,0
Works great and is light and easy to use. Somewhat slow processor but that is to expected,0

This HP 15-inch Laptop is very bad product. It has wifi adapter compatibility problems. The wifi asapter is incompatible with windows 11 operating system & does not connect to the internet.,0
Great little computer. Works awesome for what I need it for. Charges well. Battery lasts for quite awhile. Super simple and easy to set up.,0
Buen bien. El producto,0
"The keyboard RGB is awesome, key customization with SteelSeries engine works like a charm",0
Good fast laptop. Easy to upgrade the storage if you want.,0
"I'm a teacher and it's all about Google Classroom. All of the students and staff were issued the smaller chromebooks. They've seen a lot of use and the mouse pad and keys aren't working well, so I purchased this larger Acer Chromebook. I'm glad I did. It's easier on my eyes and everything works well.",0
Love this series. Have bought a couple because they are sturdy dependable good working computers.,0
Las compre para mis sobrinas y por los momentos ha ido bien,0
I was experiencing extremely slow connections and losing valuable time with my old Dell----- This ACER is blazing fast! AND--- the HDMI port allows me to connect to my big screen TV which is AWESOME. Cool webcam too.Price was right and I ma sure to get many years of service from it--- but Momma didn't raise no dummies in my family----I purchased the additional warranty for a pittance!,0
Quiero cambiarla. La pantalla me salio muy pequeña..quiero cambiarla por la de pantalla 15.6,0
"The monitor is beautiful, the graphics card is great, and the aesthetics of this laptop are very appealing.",0
"Update: barely 4 years in and the computer is (1) falling apart at the screws, (2) giving warnings of an SSD failure. This computer has great battery life (after I replaced the batter!) but is simply NOT built to last. I can no longer recommend it or its line.----- Original Post----I have had this computer for about 2 and a half years. It was amazing but there have slowly been hardward issue with it that I can't ignore.Pros:> amazing battery life even two years in. I love that I can go to school and have it last the whole day without needing my charger>great size, light weight> a lot of screen with very little bezel> it runs fast, great RAM, etc. the specs are great (though the processor is not good enough to work with Zoom backgrounds)Cons> the camera placement is so weird. I knew this going into it, but basically its on the bottom left corner of the screen so whenever you are in a meeting people get a view of your chin and up your nose> the BIGGEST Issue is that now, 2.5 years in, the base is starting to separate from the keyboard casing. This means that there is a huge gap when I have the laptop tilted at its typical angle. It's begun to manifest more problems related to this-- the power button gets caught under the misaligned keyboard top causing the laptop to turn off sporadically, the bluetooth no longer works because the base is disconnecting, etc.This computer was great but the hardware just doesn't hold up. The average life span of a laptop is 3-5 years so the fact that its having hardware issues already 2.5 years in speaks poorly of it.",0
"Bought this 4 years ago for gaming, school and work. It still works well and only degradation is the plastic air intake gill in the front right corner, that I most likely broke handling my pc by that single corner. Am now looking into upgrading/adding another ram stick, since I have the option and feel like I need more ram. As well as looking into 2nd external monitor option, although I read it supposedly supports 2 monitors, it seems for the second monitor support I need a different cable connection, mini port - which might be an issue. I ordered this after doing a 12 hour research, since I didn't know much about pc's and their components, must say this was the best money could buy for my needs back then. When buying a pc I considered I should make do with 2 drawbacks, judging from the feedback I read on forums discussing pc's. So in the end, with the budget I allocated for this, I choose sound (speakers) and battery life to be the drawbacks (instead 50%+ price tag or sacrificing other specs). In the end I didn't even notice these ""drawbacks"" as I use external speakers or headset and mostly use my pc while plugged in. I have heard people often complain about battery life and speaker quality on many pc reviews, I think that its rather odd to expect a pc to run high resource demanding games on battery power. About speakers I don't know, is it the cost or the space that impacts the quality, but it doesn't matter to me as long as its decent. If i need something better, just plug in or connect proper audio devices. Also I don't use camera much, but its okay.",0
"I really enjoy this laptop. I have it since 1 month ago and I really enjoy it, my only issue is the storage and the windows update but everything else 10/10",0
"I am overall very satisfied with my 2020 Apple MacBook Air purchase. Every works smooth and no problems so far. Powerful laptop. For now, I highly recommend.",0
"No issues with the laptop so far except on one very important part. The product page lists the screen as a ""14 inch 400nits Full HD (1920x1080), Anti-Glare IPS level NanoEdge bezel display"". This is not correct, the screen is not 400 nits in brightness, it's 300 nits. It's a mediocre panel, certainly usable, but the false information is a really big negative. The model number for it is BOE07E9 NV140FHM-N63.",0
I received my HP laptop today although it was 2 days early my refurbished laptop had a cracked screen in the bottom left-hand corner the packaging was perfect but the laptop ruined I use my laptop for work so it rains really set me back hope to hear from them soon I will keep the page updated,0
"Huge upgrade from my old Lenovo IdeaPad. Much faster for everything, and it barely weighs anything. Very convenient, looks slick, and I actually enjoy using my laptop again instead of getting frustrated with it.Some reviews online mentioned issues with the bottom of it being too thin and the mouse clicking when you're just holding the laptop - I've had it for 3 months now and that hasn't happened even once. I carry it around from living room to home office pretty often too. No issues with that.The only issue I've had is with using Citrix Workspace with dual monitors - I have a docking station and 2 work monitors hooked up to the laptop, and they work great with no issues most of the time. Using Citrix to remote in, only 1 monitor works; the other 2 are always frozen.",0
"I spent about 1 month comparing every gaming laptop to try and get the best bang/buck and this was it. I've had it for about ~2 months and have abused it. 12+ hours of straight gaming and right after watching movies, this thing had no problems. If you are reading reviews because you are on edge scroll back up and buy this, don't be a loser. Keyboard + Numpad + Screen + Sleek Design, since I have purchased this I have had sex about 3 times a day, before this laptop I was a virgin.",0
"I do not recommend a 15"" monitor. If you are in the market for a gaming laptop, 17"" matters. I didn't think it would, but I was wrong.Also, the price of the computer is just too much. Even getting it a little cheaper during Prime Day, it was still too much. There are other reputable brands out there that charge a lot less. Don't pay more money for a name if you can get similar quality and possibly better features with a cheaper brand. The lap top even looks boring to me.",0
"The screen quality is good but the sensitivity is way too much . After 1 month of usage one morning it just simply didn't turn on. The seller has not been helpful at all to resolve I spent over 2000 for this laptop and for it to have issues so soon, it's definitely not recommended.",0
This laptop really is fast. The graphics are intense. Excellent value for the money.,0
"This laptop was my first gaming laptop. For the price, there was very few laptops that came close to its performance. Every game I have played so far, has run flawlessly on the highest graphic settings with no issues. The only cons I have: the battery life is not great, it tends to run hot so I keep the second fan running which is obviously noticeably louder. This laptop has been 100% worth the money and has the best value for its tier of gaming power. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a powerful gaming laptop without spending a ridiculous amount.",0
"I needed a laptop that could run the Valve Index, for a super cool art project that I got a grant for. After many, many hours of researching laptops and one whole purchase-and-return of an Alienware machine, I got this one. It runs its video right off the graphics card through the mini DispalayPort and it handles the hard specs of the Index amazingly well. And it does it for cheap. GET IT GET IT GET IT!",0
Absolutely love this Chromebook. I bought one for my daughter couple of months ago and she loves it. I needed something simple and easy to use. This definitely did that.,0
"I really enjoy this laptop, It's super quick. Loads into windows under 4 seconds.I added a ""Kingston Technology HyperX Impact 8GB 2666MHz DDR4 CL15 260-Pin SODIMM Laptop Memory (HX426S15IB2/8)"" ram module for making the Ram 16GB total, this will work best with the shared GPU memory.YOU WILL NEED MORE RAM FOR HEAVIER GAMESThe onboard GPU memory is shared with your ram when in gaming mode.I played space engineers, which requires around 5GB of VRAM for medium gameplay, it leaked into my actual ram, but with the hyperx upgrade there was only slight FPS drops but not enough to affect gameplay. Ram is important.I recommend windows 10 Pro 1909, don't use 2004 on this laptop will die really quick in Win 10 2004. Lasted about 3 hours under full load, whist 1909 lasted around 7 hours under full load, close to expected battery life.The Intel CPU Turbos to 3.98 Ghz while plugged in, if you set it that way.If you plan to install linux, the NVME will not be detected at boot time, to fix this, head to bios and on the first tab or second tab press ""CTRL"" + ""S"" to bring up a setting and change and disable intel optane firmware to use nvme in linux, as when you boot a non windows OS, the nvme will be placed into sleep mode.As for a extra nvme slot, i picked up ""Western Digital 250GB WD Blue SN550 NVMe Internal SSD - Gen3 x4 PCIe 8Gb/s, M.2 2280, 3D NAND, Up to 2,400 MB/s - WDS250G2B0C"" from many other users, as this will take full advantage of the laptops firmware and hardware. You can pick higher space storage, but as a light gamer, this was enough for me.As for the 2.5"" drive, i picked up a ""ST1000LM024 HN-m101Mbb"" It's a 1TB Mechanical Drive with decent write and read speeds for lighter games, and game storage. Granted it is slower, but for this laptop its perfect and I can get full R/W speeds that were advertised. If you notice, it's the same drive inside the XBox 1 - 1st Gen, so You can game on it as well, not as fast load times, but its fast enough to still enjoy a game.Besides the battery life, this is a really good laptop if you go out to a friends house for a night and do some moderate gaming like a LAN party, or a small road trip, or sitting out side for a few hours.I do not recommend taking this on a flight. Unless you get an extra battery.As of this message, I am using this as my main pc, and quite enjoy it, the Intel i5v9 is great and the GTX 1650 plays most games on Medium/High at 50/60fps.Also another note to stay on 1909, is that windows f--ked up the NVIDIA auto select method for Intel Graphics and GPU graphics, so some games will default to intel CPU instead of NVIDIA.Also, This laptop can play COD: Cold War at High settings with 48/55fps under heavy scenes and a perfect 60fps on normal fighting.",0
exceeded my expectations i loved better investment.,0

"The UX550VE is a very disappointing entry to the Zenbook lineup in my opinion. Seriously, do not buy this laptop! Let me explain:I am an IT professional and long-time Asus customer, both for laptops and motherboards. I have used a Zenbook UX31A as my primary ultrabook for about six years since I bought it at its release. It has been an exceptional machine - even in its old age (just had to replace the charging port, but now it's my Linux portable). Looking back, I am surprised to have used the same laptop for so long, and that should speak to how well built of a machine it is. So of course when I needed a new laptop, I quickly decided on another Zenbook.When I was shopping for laptops, I really *really* wanted the UX550VD. I contacted Asus many times when it would be released in the US, but of course they could never tell me. Eventually the old Zenbook went out of commission for a while, so I had to upgrade and settled on the UX550VE. Don't get me wrong, the specs on this machine at nothing to sneeze at and there are some good aspects to it. However, the flaws are so glaring that they ruin the entire user experience and so those are all I will be discussing here.First of all, the charging port on my particular unit super shoddy. Really janky af. It's not lined up with the case, so I feel like I am going to break it every time I insert the charger. It does work, but this should not have passed QC. See attached photo. The rest of the physical build is just okay; this is still a pretty big and fairly hefty machine - nothing to write home about.Second, the fingerprint scanner is pretty nice to have, but why in the world is it ON THE TOUCHPAD!? Asus, I'd actually really like an answer to this question. Having the fingerprint reader on the touchpad renders the entire right corner of the touchpad UNUSABLE as a touchpad. Are you telling me the fingerprint scanner cannot be placed to the right of the touchpad on all this empty space below the keyboard? Lenovo and other brands have figured this out already. I should have considered this when purchasing the laptop, but this is just really, really stupid design - unless I'm missing something. Even the part of the touchpad above and to the right of the fingerprint scanner does not actually work - it's just cosmetic. I'll be waiting for an explanation to this design choice, Asus.Speaking of poor design choices, what's with the lack of ventilation on this thing? There really is not any ventilation except for the hinge that I can see. You guys cram an i7 and 1070 in here and expect a hinge to cool it all when I'm gaming? Let me tell you from experience, that is not happening. Even when playing lightweight 2D games, the fan in this machine becomes annoyingly loud and is still inadequate to cool the hardware inside (yes, with proper atmosphere on a table). That means the keyboard and palm rests become uncomfortably warm to the touch, and the underside of this machine gets very *very* hot.Oh, did I mention it sometimes makes these weird electrical noises? if the CPU is being heavily utilized, it kind of sounds like high-pitched whine, but it's intermittent. I don't know what it is exactly, but I am an A+ certified PC technician and I know a computer is not supposed to sound like that.On a software note, out of the box I receive this popup very often: ""There is no email program associated to perform the requested action. Please install an email program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel."" I've already removed all the bloatware, and this is coming from dllhost/COM Surrogate. Mail app is already set to my default; other default apps don't work. I'm just going to wipe it and do a fresh install of Windows 10 Pro (which I also would have liked to see included on this model) so this isn't a big deal to me, but for a standard consumer that is not a PC technician this could be very annoying. It's sloppy and cheap that I received an error message moments after powering on the computer for the first time, and it continues to pop up randomly ever now and then.I could go on but I think that's enough for this review. My point is that I have been very happy with Asus for a long time, but this laptop feels incredibly cheap and not at all worth the price tag or the ""Pro"" moniker. I am suffering severe buyers remorse and probably will not be purchasing any Asus products in the future. I'm seeing way too much competition from other brand that offer better products. I do not recommend this laptop to anybody, and in fact I suggest you avoid it at all costs.",0
This laptop is totally AMAZING ?????,0
"I love the graphics on this computer, which are an upgrade for me after my 10 year old Acer Aspire died. That one had touchscreen, which I miss, but this newer Swift is a great laptop. It is lightweight. I love that as sometimes I travel with my computer and lighter is better! The only thing I haven't liked is that even when the sound is at 100, it isn't very loud. Two thumbs up Acer! You have earned my brand loyalty. I LOVED my Aspire, so Acer was the only brand I really wanted to look at when I had to replace it.",0
"Very poor operability. Glitchy, slow, freezes constantly. More than one Chrome tab open results in constant loading, freezing, and poor usability. Don't even attempt to work back and forth between tabs or you're in for a real disappointment!",0
The battery life is awful on this otherwise great setup. MSI Synapse software is finicky and requires regular tinkering.,0
"Functions well, lightweight. No problems so far.",0
"The laptop is amazing, but windows 11 really takes away from it.Setup - Quick and Easy!Touchscreen - is easy to use and very responsive.Price - on par with similar brands.OLED Screen - Wow, just amazing and crisp. 4k video's look amazing!Noise - I have not noticed any noise minus a slight hum in a very quiet room from this laptop.Battery Life - Excellent lifespanI love the USB-C power cable and the fact that it can be on either side is amazing!Wifi and Bluetooth are awesome - I have connected a multitude of devices without issue.I have my laptop set up with a secondary monitor and run 4 Chrome Windows each with a few tabs - some pull more data than others and I don't have any lag or issues at all.Windows 11 - There are some issues here that make any computer not as easy to work on. The taskbar for one (you cannot resize it, you cannot ungroup the icons, you cannot have smaller icons, it doesn't show the time on secondary monitors and you cannot move it.) Setting the default browser in Windows 11 is very difficult. You need to set your default under HTTP and HTTPS. Zero offline local accounts. The interface requires too many clicks and it is not straightforward. And of course the main settings app doesn't include everything in any older Control Panel.",0
"I bought this laptop knowing it wouldn't be a powerhouse. This is a basic laptop that functions well for a great budget price. I bought this for the online classes I am taking and some light internet browsing, aka Pinterest, Facebook, etc. I wouldn't recommend it for gaming or for if you need any software like AutoCad, photo editing software or for work purposes. This is a great personal use computer and for school depending on your degree. I immediately uninstalled the game pack that came with it. I wish you could uninstall the other bloatware that comes with it, unfortunately I am having a hard time finding it to uninstall. There are so many ""trials"" for games, dropbox, etc. that I don't want popping up all the time hence the 4 stars.",0
Easy to change backlit keyboard colors etc and overall solid construction.,0
worked fine for my daughter for a month. then wifi wont stayed on. googled for solutions. seems its a hardware issue. out of window for amazon return,0
I love everything about this laptop except for the camera. I purchased the laptop for video conferencing while working from home and the camera picture is grainy and blurry because it's only a 480p. I wish I would have noticed that before I ordered it. If you don't need it for the camera then it's a nice laptop. Going to purchase a different laptop with a 1080p camera and use this one for something else.,0
The sound is clear,0
The monitor is very good. I can play every game without any problem. The images and colors are awesome.,0
I love how light weight the entire thing is.,0
I noticed a bit of coil whine,0
Why a company would lock the bios from the user and require physical modification to the chip is beyond me. Can't dual boot this machine as I would have to take it into a repair facility because Acer for some reason doesn't think that the community can't take care of their own devices. I won't be purchasing an Acer again.,0
👌💯,0
Got the i9 3070ti version for 1.2k. Decent specs for the price. Thermal is much improved comparing to G15. Able to run 2k game at highest setting smoothly. 16:10 monitor is also good for productivity task. Only downside is one ssd slot but can't ask for more at this price point.,0

That caused some headache in only 1 of the online html5 games with text getting blurred and broken randomly.Turning MUX switch on fixed the problem.Have not used it for extensive gaming and mostly using this for browsing and day to day work, some online games - no complaints what so ever.",0

"This is my first higher gaming computer and it's amazing, it runs all my games on high or ultra high settings it's not bulky so it's easy to pack around and it's tough enough I don't worry about it randomly breaking, a great laptop I would recommend to anyone",0
Wished I had read ALL of the reviews before purchasing. I could have paid less for a listing that lets me know the computer is refurbished. This does not specify that it is and I did not receive a NEW chrome book. Extremely disappointed. I may just return it.,0
when i received the laptop it was packaged brand new. i've only had this laptop for a week now and it crashed the very next day i got it. thought maybe i was just on too many windows but i literally only had chrome up and league of legends downloading. i have downloaded steam but the games won't launch. this laptop net framework had errors so i could download directx to play games. now the keyboard back light is not working. everytime i reset the computer i get the asus system program screen. the performance of this laptop is terrible. this shouldnt even be 900. i feel like this is a 400 laptop. i did not think i would have this much issues already. planning to return this,0
"I have had this computer for just over a week, I have already had to re-install windows after the start menu received a crucial error. Trying to do advance repair did not work. I already returned on HP computer, I don't know if it is HP computers or windows 10.Trying to use USB ports fr the first time and file explorer will not show them, computer management shows them so you know they are being read. HP support really no support had to tell technical that the fact they could see the external drives was second to the fact ports are not showing up in file explorer so I can select them. Amazon rep give me a link to seller ask a question, I will try.Update 11/24/2019So I finally got the external drives to work thru usb, and more importantly to show up in file explorer...Long story short windows file explorer does not recognize Mac file system....After that the external speaker stop working..I fixed that..Windows requires more handling of the O.S. I am happy with the size of the computer. Windows just needs more love then I am use too.",0
I love it. Software is great. Runs at a fast pace.,0
"I recently purchased this and have only had it a few days. I already have a nice desktop workstation that I purchased in 2018 for computer graphics and animation work. I do some gaming, but not really my reason for purchase. I needed a laptop with similar performance so that I could travel and work away from home. I needed the largest screen available, which is 17.3, and also a good amount of ram with a good video card. I finally chose this Sager for it's good value and it seemed to check off the boxes for a strong package. 17 inch screen, 32g ram, RTX 2060 6bm graphics card and I got the 2 -1TB SSD card option for a bit more money. I paid extra for the faster shipping and received it within 3 days. It feels like a solid laptop and good quality. The keyboard feels high quality and the buttons have good feedback and solid feel. I use a usb wireless mouse so I can not say much about the mouse pad function on the laptop, but it seems very good and I like the feel of the left/right mousepad function keys on the laptop. After the usual windows 10 bootup steps it was up and running nicely. Took me a while to get it loaded with all my work programs, but seems really fast and comparable to my desktop workstation speed. I am now able to work on some computer animation projects away from home and travel if needed. I did also buy a laptop cooling pad with fans. I did try out ""The Witcher 3"" pc game with full graphics and the laptop definitely switches on the fans and heats up. The cooling pad is an extra layer of peace of mind to keep things a bit cooler, but maybe not totally necessary. If you play games a lot, then get a cooling pad. For my work the fans do not kick in that open, except for when I need to playback larger scenes in real time. Over all I am happy with my purchase so far and the speed and quality seems good. Reliability remains to be seen with more time under the belt, but hoping for the best.",0
"I thoroughly enjoy this chromebook at 15.6 inches. A Quality Product, much less expensive than a notebook; which I really don't need.

They are much easier for me to use; if you are considering that option.This is a great product, and I highly recommend it!",0
Never regret buying it,0

"I bought this to replace an ACER v5-571 that I've had since 2013. My previous Acer was excellent, needing only a HDD in almost 8 years of hard daily business use. In my search for a replacement laptop, I specifically wanted a discrete graphics card instead of the built in Intel Graphics. My laptop is plugged in 99.9% of the time so I have no idea of battery life. I'm not a big gamer, just occasionally. Based on mostly Rave reviews online and you tube, and my previous Acer experience, I was excited to find the Nitro 5 for an excellent price. I was concerned about the small ssd drive of 256 gb as I do a lot of graphics work. I added a 256gb thumb drive to the USB 3 port for just over $30 on Amazon, now I have a more acceptable 512GB storage. I have 2 areas that could be improved. First is it takes several steps to activate the Geforce GTX 1650 video card in the Windows settings as it is disabled on arrival. Also, the volume of MAXX sound thru the built in speakers is weak. I definitely recommend this to others. I also advise purchasers to check the specs of this laptop on Amazon as there are multiple listings of Nitro 5 with previous years cpu's. The 2019 version should have the Intel I5-9300H processor.",0
"We purchased these for remote school. They pretty regularly fail to recognize headphones or have their internal mics fail. Rebooting usually fixes this, but with a managed Chromebook, the login process is really arduous.Don't recommend.",0
"Es una buena laptop calidad-precio, lo unico es que la version de i3 no es touch y de preferencia, agreguenle 4 Gb de ram mas",0
I bought this computer to play may different games and it runs great on anything!,0
Your product stinks because it keeps locking me out even though the password is the right one. Why do we have to pay another 10 dollars for a driver update when we pay good money on it,0
Great buy for the price!,0
"They should have just called this the Chromebook 3.I like it, it is definitely not overly powerful... It isn't strong enough to handle a CS job... However, I am enjoying the Chromebook for writing, accounting, and a few other nonheavy intensive things, the long battery life does make it easy to write on the go without worrying about plugging in. Which is the biggest plus with the CB. The screen quality still bothers me quite a bit, as in order for the best viewing experience you need to be directly level with it or slightly to the side. If you have the laptop lower then yourself, it whitewashes if you look down at it from slightly above. This right here is my biggest complaint.. as I rather have the view from the sides worse than one from the top. Because this makes typing on your lap a bit more difficult of a task without having the screen tilted back at a more awkward angle, that remains useless for non-touch screens.For the price it is worth it for sure. Just to be able to browse/research/write/account/email/etc on the go. Don't expect to much in the game department, you are restricted still to the bare minimum. As for how long it will last, all Chromebook style laptops are set to become unusable within 3-5years, as each brand stops supporting them. (this is from launch, not purchase date). I do find this tactic style of sale rather rude and tactless, like the good old Nintendo time switch that had the old Nintendo's fail by flashing blue screen after a year of owning them (don't lie Nintendo the only ones alive today are those that were refurbished,/rebuilt and every system that sold during that time flatlined.)The case itself doesn't feel cheap but is obviously made of plastic. The touchpad is responsive, and the sound is fair quality, not very loud. It does have some weight to it which is on the plus side. The charger is as small as needle you will need to be careful that it doesn't overheat while being plugged in to prevent damage, and snapping.",0
This laptop is perfect for all my school work and is budget friendly as well ! I can bring it anywhere because of how small it is :$,0
It's pretty easy to change the lighting settings in Armoury Crate after an auto update of ROG Live Service came through.,0
"Well my old lap top was S L O W and was my 1st,, I didnt know what solid state was,, This chrome book is fast, I really like it, and it does all I need to do.",0
I wanted to love this and it runs smoothly but the camera is very grainy and low quality. I was going to send it back but the seller will add a 20% restocking fee which would be around 60.00 ..so if the camera is important to you Id skip this laptop and get another,0
I love it I am home schooled and it’s great the battery life is wonderful last me several days but I am only on it about 1-2 hours a day so that makes the battery life last a long time. I would highly recommend it.,0
"Alta calidad de materiales, especificaciones correctas, dise?o bde muy buen gusto y rápida entrega.",0
Can't complain got a $200 computer to do a select few things.,0

"Product is good but it did not come with a genuine copy of windows 10 so it's point less to buy. Beware of the ""certified refurbished"" ones.",0
This computer DOES NOT have a back lit keyboard as advertised. I am not happy about that at all. Otherwise it's ok for communications and business needs.,0
"that this laptop is very light, especially for a 17"" gaming laptop.",0
"Very little sound, often headphone is required. Performance/speed also not as expected.",0
It is well built and really a great laptop for the price,0
Great laptop but no backlit key board as advertised,0
"Me encantó lo liviana que es para la gama de laptop que es, me fascinó su pantalla los colores se ven estupendos, solo que me llegó con una línea en el lado izquierdo de la pantalla por lo que tuve que regresarla, me hubiese gustado probarla a fondo.",0

Worse computer ever not 2.5 prosser is not it's a 1.7,0
"The Acer Aspire 5 with 15.6"" display powered by an Intel i3 11th gen CPU is a surprisingly able little powerhouse that will satisfy the needs of most users.Let me tell you why in this complete review.What you receive:Arriving in a standard low cost box most notebook makers use these days, I was ready to dig in and see what Acer had to offer.Inside, you will find the laptop itself, a very small power adapter, power cable, a few small leftlets and a custom amazon.com insert with a special support system for amazon only buyers.First impressions:Having used much larger and beefier laptops, the small size of this notebook really surprised me. Sporting a full sized 15.6"" display and a large, spaced keyboard WITH numeric pad (thank you!), I was eager to see what this little notebook could do. It is very sleek and easy to hold. Weighing in at 3lb 10oz (~1.6kg), it is extremely light. The power adapter is so small the standard power cord overshadows it. This makes it an easy to transport unit.CPU and stats:The Acer Aspire 5 comes equipped with a brand new 11th gen 10nm Intel i3-1115G4 CPU. These are brand new CPUs from Intel and as such offer a step up in performance from the previous 10th gen models both in computational power and power efficiency. The G4 in the CPU name is its GPU model. It is a step down from the best G7 but more than enough to power the 1080p display. Performance wise, if you hit the system with anything single thread heavy, temps will get up to around ~81c but run at a consistent 4.1ghz. If you run something that is CPU intensive and multithreaded, the system will eventually throttle down to ~3.6ghz all core. Single thread performance is outstanding and multithreaded performance is more than enough for day to day use.Along with a brand new CPU, you also get a surprisingly speedy 128GB Samsung SSD and 4GB of 2666 soldered memory with a free DIMM slot for expansion. I highly recommend adding another 4GB memory module as 8GB gives Windows 10 plenty of extra space to run and enables dual channel memory for even better performance.First time starting up and usage:Upon first boot you are greeted with some quick and easy setup steps and off you go. This unit comes with a specialized version of Windows 10 called ""Windows 10 Home S"" The ""S"" stands for security as this version will put most novice users at ease as it offers enhanced security on many levels including authorizing and authenticating any and all apps to be installed through the Microsoft Store so you are assured the apps you download and install are certified and not malware. You do have an option for reducing or turning this off, but for the ultimate in security, you will want to leave this on if you are unsure.You will want to run Windows Update as there was 14 updates waiting for my unit along with a firmware update.This unit also includes Alexa. Alexa is actually a custom app pre-installed on your laptop that integrates with Amazon. If you are a user of Alexa, you will feel right at home.Using this laptop for day to day tasks, I was pretty impressed with its speed and responsiveness surfing the web, Zoom, using Office, Teams and more. I used it for some light development work in Visual Studio and it performed very well as Visual Studio is single threaded heavy although for larger code bases I would suggest upgrading your memory. Laptops and especially thin and light notebooks have come a long way. No longer do you have to compromise performance when using budget priced units. We've reached a point where for the bulk of users, this laptop will be more than enough to get the job done.Beware: If you're a hardcore gamer, require a powerful GPU or you run software that is heavily multithreaded and computationally heavy in nature, this notebook is not for you. For the vast majority of users, this will work just fine and then some but if you are in that market segment you most likely know that already.Battery Life:Battery life was very good running in balanced mode. The unit is equipped with a ~53Wh battery. Using it over the course of the day, I was able to get ~6.5hrs of battery life. If you adjust your settings, you could get a little more or a lot less depending on what you want to do and how.Display quality:The 1920x1080 (1080P) display is good but not great. Using a 60hz TN (Not IPS) Innolux N156HGA-EA3 panel, the display maxes at 220 nits in brightness and is limited to 6-bit 262k color. This results in approximately 46% color coverage. For standard day to day use, it is more than adequate and it offers a very nice picture for the price with passable viewing angles and is very easy on the eyes; but if you're into heavy photo editing and/or require proper image color correction / higher color gamut you will need to seek out a notebook with a better display at a much higher price point.Ports:The unit comes packed with several ports including even ethernet which was nice to see. You also get HDMI, an array of USB 3.2 Type A and one Type C port. The unit also comes equipped with onboard Wifi ready to go so you can connect immediately to any available wireless networks or connect a wired ethernet cable.Inside:Once you remove the back cover (which comes off easily after removing a series of clearly visible screws), you are able to upgrade the memory via a single DDR4 SO-DIMM slot and you can add a 2.5"" laptop compatible drive of your choice. I opted to install a spare 120GB 2.5"" for demonstration purposes. If you are an advanced user, the 128GB NVMe SSD drive is also user replaceable if you need more primary storage.Keyboard and Trackpad:As noted before, the keyboard is very spacious for such a small unit and the included numeric pad is a definite plus. The keyboard is non-backlit and a bit soft to the touch but absolutely workable and I found myself flying along after a minute or so of adjustment. The trackpad is responsive enough but I do prefer trackpads with separate and distinct left and right buttons. Like many newer ultrabooks and notebooks, when you open the display the bottom shifts down and elevates the keyboard giving you a nice little angle for typing and increase the space on the bottom for better fan intake for cooling.Webcam:On a few Zoom calls and Teams test, the webcam and mic were definitely acceptable and equal or a slight step above extreme budget priced webcams. It isn't on the level of a $80USD+ webcam like a C920 but it more than got the job done with meeting members noting it was working as intended.Fan Noise:When in use, the single system fan cooling the CPU does sometimes spin up and you will hear it. While it isn't overbearing or obnoxiously loud, it definitely is there and the Acer Aspire 5 is not a dead silent/fanless notebook and will spin up when needed. When taxed, the fans will kick up to the next level and are clearly audible but at an acceptable dB range.Summary:For ~$400USD, you get a LOT of computer for the price. You are presented with a completely capable, ready to go out of the box notebook with Windows 10 ready and rarin to get to work. The Secure mode version means you won't have to worry about unauthorized programs/apps being installed. The SSD, while small, is speedy and it is surprising that the system works so well even with the baseline 4GB. I spent a roughly a week using this as my main notebook as a test and it was able to basically take care of everything I needed during the week. Whether you are working or doing school work from home, a traveling road warrior or want something light, the Acer Aspire 5 may just be what you need at a very good price.For its price and what you get, this is a 5/5 for me.",0
"Does everything I need it to and then some.Great for gaming, though I'll be leaving the really demanding stuff to my Series X.Considering how hard it is to get a gpu right now, deals like this give players some hope.",0
"This is not my first Samsung Chromebook. My other one is much older, and the charger broke. Couldn't find one that fit, so purchased this new one. The only problem is the sound. It is so quiet. So now, I use the charger and plug in my old Chromebook. Watched a movie with my granddaughter, and as we watched, the volume went down until we could barely hear it. Found the movie on Hulu, and finished watching it on the TV",0
Best deal out there on a laptop that can be easily upgraded if needed. Price is a deal.,0
If you get this laptop refurbished it’s a great deal. I got it to run video editing software.,0
"This Dynabook (formally Toshiba) Satellite Pro laptop is a pretty good deal for the price. Obviously, at this price point, you are making tradeoffs between power and display, build quality and cost. The balance between these tradeoffs is pretty good. The Intel i5/Iris Xe graphics and 8GB of DDR4 RAM are not going to get you very far in AAA gaming, but with a Cinebench CPU multicore rating of 3673, you can absolutely play light PC games and will experience no delay with a few Chrome tabs or watching online streaming. The 15.6-inch FHD is 1920x1080 and gets pretty bright. With pretty minimal bezels, it is pleasant to use and peruse. The M.2 PCIe storage is quick and, at 256GB, you should be more than fine if you pair this with an external hard drive or a cloud service.Performance aside, you really see a bit of corner cutting on the keyboard and trackpad. The keyboard is tacky and has no backlight, so it really isn’t a pleasant experience to use and I wouldn’t suggest typing on it for any duration. The trackpad fairs a little better, but I have noticed that I do get some ghosting and have found that it fails to register clicks with an annoying regularity. To be clear, these are not deal breakers, but worth noting. All in all, it is a fairly decent low to mid range laptop.",0
I am thankful that Xidu is sending me a mouse because I am terrible with pads.,0
Easy to use and fast,0
Great product for the price,0
"Excelente articulo, buen tiempo de entrega,muy recomendado",0
"This is a solid performing laptop with plenty of power to run the latest software.Pros:Fast. Excellent performance.The i7 processor is powerful and capable.Compact. Everything fits nicely into the 15.6"" size.I like the keyboard and trackpad. Even after coming from Apple laptops.Good selection of ports and jacks.The battery life is good for such a powerful processor.Cons:The screen. I really can't get over the horrible screen. Why did they put it on this otherwise great laptop. It is not very good at all.My iPhone screen is way better than this one. The off angle looks better to me than straight on.I really would consider spending an extra $260 to get a Zenbook with a 4K screen and similar performance specs.If your going to run a second screen this may may work for you. However as a primary carry this is really not that great. You will feel like your back to non-HD TV programming.Otherwise a great laptop. I really don't like giving it only 3 stars but it is really a mis-match of components.",0
"Ever since I received this, it has been ridden with bugs. At least twice per week I have to reinstall the BIOS because it has lost connection with its network adaptor and has no ability to connect to the internet without an ethernet cable (for which it has no port). If I were not in Kenya, I would return this machine. Very frustrating to have to start my workday with a 20-minute BIOS reinstall.",0
We love HP and this laptop has stood up to its name. Great product I would definitely buy it again.,0
"This laptop has the latest of the hardware which is nice to start with but...1- the build quality is so bad, its cheap plastic that for sure will break soon of whatever kind of use.2-the reason why i returned this item is that the fans kept on for about 95% of the time even when idling, not to mention the high temps on idling as well. Tried everything, windows wise and update but sounds like it was a hardware issue.Was happy with the return anyways because of the poor build quality of this product.Bottom-line, STAY AWAY FROM ASUS.",0
"I bought this to start writing novels on. I have never used a Chromebook before, so I was kind of disappointed that I couldn't use Word, and I can't download a lot of what a regular computer will let you do, but I quickly got over that. Google Docs works just as good, and I recently got an update that added Google Play. The font is quite small on the screen, though. But a plus side is it has its own virus protection. It is also not as big as a regular laptop. It is the perfect size for me. All in all, I love it and I am glad I ran across this.",0
CPU and GPU keeps running hot. Gotten Blue Screen of Death after 2nd day playing on line. Would not recommend for a real gamer. I am not and just started playing with my husband. Have cooling pad and all. Just mailed it back to Amazon today!,0
"Got this laptop and I am amazed by the quality and speed of the computer. Really is a great laptop for the money and having the RTX 2070 graphics card is awesome. Handles everything like Modern Warfare with ease and good FPS. Doesn't get too hot although the fans will be loud, as to be expected. Only thing that I do not like is the placement of the charging port, as it is on the same side you would use you mouse with. Overall 9/10 laptop. Would recommend to anyone.",0
"Bought this at $650, and I have yet to play a game it can't run smoothly. Bought a 2TB storage device, so the 250 GB storage issue wasn't a problem.",0
This laptop replaces an older ROG that I was also very happy with. In addition to the performance and spec improvements I love the smaller form factor. Personally I don't find the fan overly noisy even at it's highest setting.,0
"I found the design of this laptop to be lightweight and elegant, taking up little space. Though the laptop itself is slim and compact, the touchpad is pretty big and the keyboard has large buttons, both of which is convenient for me because my eyesight isn't very good. The top of the keyboard also features the video control buttons (such as play, stop and volume controls) which make it convenient to control from the keyboard instead of the screen, as well as a keyboard illumination button, screen button, etc.The touch screen display is responsive and worked with no issues. I found the overall image quality to be superb and the sound quality to be decent. The camera quality wasn't perfect, but was okay for me. I also liked how the main screen was uncluttered and just had the internet browser and recycle bin on it, with the rest of the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Navigation was straightforward and I've had no problems with Windows 11. This laptop also features a fingerprint reader, for quicker logging in, which is nice. Overall, this laptop was high quality and I liked that even though it's small, it's powerful enough for my needs.",0
"I've been using this pc for quite some time now. There is nothing exeptional about this laptop. First It's just perfect for students that do part time AAA gaming yet stay discreet about it while doing some project in the library with your classmates. This thing won't scream LOOK AT ME I'M A GAMER from a mile away and yet run the witcher 3 at 30fps with the settings optimized between high and ultra. Second, the bad viewing angle is unnoticeable horizontally but a liitle annoying vertically but it's not a deal breaker. And lastly, the speakers, I honestly didn't expect them, they blasted some trap music till the students next door could hear it. The bass is just clean deep",0
"I do not have to much experience with lab tops. But Overall the computer is lacking in all qualities from what I can tell, with horrible screen quality no touch screen and half the battery life that was advertised. I had never used the chrome OS and realized it’s very limiting.It’s much slower than I expected it would’ve been. Amazon recommended I buy antivirus with it so I did. Only to realize the chrome os will not accept most anti virus software. In the end I figured $300 would get me an okay labtop I wasn’t expecting too much but I’m incredibly dissatisfied.",0
"You can't beat this machine for the price. Don't expect a miracle, but to get an I series processor in this (prime day sale) price range is pretty good. I did add ram (and downgrade to 10 pro), but even without that it was fine for everyday tasks. The main downside I've experienced is that the touch pad leaves a whole lot to be desired.",0
So overall have no complaints and this was replaceing a surface that had aged. Only complaints i have are the ram as someone else stated 16 gb is a little low would have much rather had 32gb ram and the ssd is not a common form factor which greatly limits what i can replace with other than those its not a deal breaker to me and love it,0
"This item is garbage, my son is a student and the computer won't allow him to go onziom because it has a micro dot and added to it .ad my companies IT look at the computer. They said it is impossible to take it off and go on regular zoom. My son has already missed two zoom, college classes. He used his loan money to get a computer. The reply I got from the company is that it is my problem not there .They are so rude.",0
"I have used a computer that runs low quality games at 15 FPS for a while now, and have wanted to get a new one. This is the perfect pick and is absolutely amazing! It runs most games I play at well over 200+ FPS, has Geforce RTX, which is something I have never seen before, and the computer itself looks amazing in general. I was going to get a PC, but this is much better than any PC I could find. If you are looking for a really good gaming computer, stop scrolling and get this one! Although the fans can get a little loud, is isn't all too annoying. The only other bad thing I can think of is the heat, because it can get very hot very fast. Just unplug it and deal with the bad FPS for a little until it cools down. Even unplugged the FPS is over 100+. Amazing, 10/10 no questions asked.",0
"After 40 days I didn't want to work anymore. I tried to contact someone, but I haven't heard anything from them yet.",0
"I use it mostly for study and coding. It has been 2 months since I bought this and this has been working like a gem. The battery life as well as the screen is really good. If you are looking for a working laptop under 1000$ for work purpose, I think Dell XPS is the best option.",0
Worthless!!! Please don't buy an HP. Worst product I've ever owned!!! You will be sorry if you buy !!,0
"Very nice product, fast and sleek. I will say the battery life is pretty long. Havent tried to game yet but with the extra slots it comes with for ram and hard drive I'm sure itll do just fine. The boot up time is very fast, not loud. Keyboard buttons not the loud either, can use the product while sitting next to my sleeping baby. This is a real review..nice product thanks.",0
"I purchased this for my son in July. It worked well until, all of a sudden, it died. I went thru multiple different steps that I found online to diagnose and fix it, but ultimately it never came back to life. The IT teacher at my son's school tried fixing it too, but to no avail. It wasn't dropped and nothing was spilled on it. It just stopped working. I will be ordering another Chromebook, but not this one.",0
"This is a CHROME OS machine, so if you need to manage expectations of the device. Essentially, this is a well-equipped android device. It can't take the place of a fully functional PC laptop or macbook. But knowing that, the processor and RAM allow it to cruise using the Google ecosystem (from which you have full Office compatibility) If you need to take class notes and use the internet for studying, maybe watch videos on your commute, this thing is super light, surprisingly durable with an excellent battery life.I am a Field Network Technician. I use it to access my Work Portals and log in and out of jobs, upload deliverables for finished projects etc. I didn't want to take my souped up macbook pro out in the field with me for use in various job sites. So I knew I wanted a device that I could take anywhere and would have serious battery life. Since it even literally runs the Google Play store, you can not only log into any site OR use the corresponding Android app. As we all know some apps are better than the desktop version, and sometimes you want to see the desktop site because the mobile app just doesn't have the same functionality. With this Chromebook you can do either or.BUT - there are definite limits to functionality and if you don't understand what they are, you could end up frustrated trying to get the device to perform tasks that only a windows (or full OS equipped) machine can do. For instance, after finishing a laptop repair I was following instructions to create a bootable USB disk.You can kick and scream and cry all you want, the Chromebook can't run .exe or .bat files and can't run windows processes!So before you buy, make sure you aren't being seduced by a low price into thinking you are buying a ""Laptop"" because you'll just be disappointed. But if you need something specialized, stronger and more functional than most tablets with bluetooth connectivity (for keyboards, mouse etc) and a crazy long battery life.... if that's the case, I don't know how much better you could do for the price!",0
"It is what it is...... A cheap but functional laptop. Chromebooks definitely came into themselves, offers functions and not complicated.",0
"This laptop has a lot of great features like the low price, quality screen, and backlit keyboard. The only bad-ish thing, which is probably a me thing, is the mousepad has a slight tactile feedback built into it using horizontal ridges that feels bad on my fingers.",0
The screen is bright and the touchscreen responsive.,0
"Getting rid of S Mode was a breeze (and free!) A quick Google and maybe 2 minutes. I'm able to do what I need to do for class, though the laptop can be a little slow if you have too many tabs open. The construction is good, better than my Samsung Chromebook of the same price. The battery lasted me through 6 hours of class time and studying in top of that! Definitely a good laptop for not much money at all",0
Liking it so far. Quiet and fast. Decent battery life. Light weight is nice,0
"Ordered August 16, 2019 for school. The computer was meeting my needs and working great until September 26, 2019. It would not turn on, then I plugged in and the charge light was on, but only momentarily, the light no longer indicates a charge, the battery is hot despite being charged. I tried several outlets, unplugging to let the battery cool, but nothing seems to be working. Just over 30 days and it's dead :( I have contacted seller through Amazon to see how we can fix the problem.I will say that before it stopped working, the screen was great, battery life was good lasting a day of use at school, keys were easy to use, and the speed of the operating system was sufficient for my needs as a law student. I hope there's a remedy for my laptop, I need it back asap.",0
the windows button button location and the hdmi wire doesnt go into the hdmi port on the side.,0
Works great looks great for what I need it's more then enough.,0
"According to Passmark, this laptop's Ryzen 7 processor is only 3% faster than the i7 processor in my old laptop, yet this laptop feels like it is 5x faster. I'm guessing there's more to the story than just CPU throughput, like the bandwidth of the AMD chipset drivers. I bought this mainly because the USB 3 ports on my HP laptop were flaky, one would only work with USB 2 devices. All my USB 3 devices work perfectly with the AMD laptop. I'm done with Intel, for now.I added an ADATA 8GB RAM module, and an ADATA 2TB SATA3 SSD. I also love the 17-inch screen. It's only 1080, but after having two laptops with 4K screens, I'm liking 1080 just fine.",0
I like it because it is easy to use.,0
This Acer laptop replaces my 11 yr old Acer laptop which still works but has slowed down in old age. Hope the new super fast Acer serves me as well. Love the 1080 screen and and getting results in a nano second. Hated that it came tied to Microsoft but found out that I could remove the S mode which I did. Not being of the younger generation it wasn't quite as simple to do as stated but got there eventually. All in all happy and satisfied with this under $400 purchase.,0
"This is the overall perfect laptop for college, university or even high-school. You will not regret buying this product.",0
Love the quality of this laptop and for a very reasonable price! Only con is the battery doesn't last long.,0
"Not sure about the ""S"" mode. Didn't engage it yet as I heard it really slows the system down and you cant revert back once you make the change. Not a gamers computer. Seems very good for household use.",0
Very happy with this purchase. Great value for the price. I turned it on and it was ready to go. It prompted me to follow about two instructions—like entering my Google email and it was ready to use. I didn’t need to set up and download a bunch of things. It was already done for me. Exactly what I was looking for.,0
"The laptop is amazing. Quality is great, audio is a little off, but fixed quickly and price was reasonable. Five stars.",0
It has a fast Ryzen 5 2500U APU with plenty of graphics for gaming and videos. It comes with 8GB of DDR4 Sdram and a1TB HDD. Both are upgradable for the future. This is a great laptop for the price.***It doesn't have a touchscreen in case you are looking for a laptop with that feature.,0
I've only been using the Chromebook for a few days. This is a great unit for all your basic needs. It is convenient and lightweight. A full charge battery life is approximately 14 hours.,0
"This chromebook is alright. The screen is great for the price, and the keyboard is nice. The trackpad is the worst I've used on a chromebook. It was temperamental with the light clicking. The speakers look like they would be amazing, but they sounded like two tin cans. They were a good volume, though. If all you're doing is watching movies, it should be good. They weren't that great for music if you're picky.I ended up returning this laptop. It was just too heavy/bulky, and I carry it around the house. I got the CB-515 instead. I managed to find it for only $10 more than this computer. It's lighter, faster, and the speakers sound better. The trackpad is twice as nice too...and the keyboard lights up. It's a way better computer.",0
Being a chromebook it's very easy to use with built-in apps.,0
I lovd it.. its fast and easy to navigate,0
"Solo tiene una pega, cuando se enciende después de un periodo de tiempo largo (algunos días) pierde su carga. Pero por lo demás todo excelente, no pediría más en una laptop. Es fantástica en rendimiento para tareas de dise?o 3D y gráfico.",0
I bought this laptop for my son to use in college. He loves it and carries it with him at all time. It’s the the perfect balance for school work and gaming.,0
the membrane keyboard feels decent and is VERY quiet.,0

"So forget about all the other reviews. This is the skinny from a higher learning teacher: Is it fast? Yes. If you are browsing the web, watching videos, etc. It’s faster than my MSI with 16gb ram and RTX 2060 video card. Is it silent? YES. It’s the whole reason I bought it, so good for me. How is rendering audio or video? Good, BUT…My iMac 5k from 2017 with 4gb of video ram is faster with the few renderings I have done. The following is what surprised me (especially after reading all the fab reviews of battery): I put my Mac Air on sleep mode when I shut it down. Didn’t use it for a couple days, came back to get it and the battery was completely dead. Zero! I was VERY surprised. I can always leave an MSI, Lenovo, HP, on sleep mode for a week or more. Those are the things I have experienced in my first week. Hope it helps.",0
"This arrived exactly as i expected. I live in Jamaica and this product was shipped straight to me. It arrived perfectly packaged without even the slightest scratch or blemish. Just know that if you were to purchase this product you are getting exactly what you expected. It works. No hiccups or hangups. It's just fast, smooth and a premium looking laptop. I cant say enough good things about this device. Just take care of it and trust that you will have a working computer for the next decade or more. Get it!!",0

"This laptop is fantastic. The user interface is easy, and the speed is incredible. My favorite thing about this laptop is the keyboard. The keys make typing SO SMOOTH and quick. It’s a bit heavier than I expected, but this is likely because of the DVD drive. It is still lightweight for a 15” laptop. I would recommend.",0
"Overall, this is a good laptop, for gaming or not. I tried it out initially with the installed Windows OS. Then, I completely removed that an put on Ubuntu. The install worked flawlessly and the video card worked with the OS. Performance of the laptop itself, especially the SSD and the video card are great. I've tested it with several different games on Steam and it installed and ran them all, just fine. The quality of the video is pretty good too. With the spinning disk having 1tb of room, you have tons of storage. It supports USB and USB-C. It has output for HDMI and you can plug it right into your network (as well as WIFI of course).Now, there are a number of nits I have with the laptop. First, the keyboard. The keys have a mushy, soft, unresponsive feel. What's worse, because of the inclusion of a number pad, the keys are offset. If you are literally holding the machine in your lap, to have it centered, your right arm is a little awkwardly place. Or, you get your arms centered and then the laptop is kind of falling between your knees. I can see why you would want arrow keys as a separate input for gaming, but the number pad. Either way, adding that makes the laptop awkward to use.Next, the spinning rust disk. It adds a lot of storage, but it also adds weight and power consumption. I'd rather see double the storage on the SSD and have no spinning disk at all if it reduces the weight of the laptop and makes the battery last longer.Speaking of the battery, I could only get two hours of life out of a charge. Don't plan on taking this on a long airplane flight unless there's a power supply.It is a nice looking laptop, stylish and although plastic, doesn't feel cheap. The mount between the screen and the keyboard does feel a bit less than solid, so you could see problems there over time.I like the laptop quite a bit and will get work out of it as well as game time. However, the awkward key placement and especially the short battery life makes it a ""home only"" machine. I wouldn't want to travel with it for fear I'd be only part way through a long flight and no longer have a laptop for games, videos or even doing work.",0
This is great deal.Good CPU and GPU.Screen is big enough for editing video and really fast.Little bit heavy but that's okay.I love it.,0
"We were always diehard HP users, but got tired of their system glitches. We bought our first ASUS for our son's digital schooling. It was such a great computer that I did not hesitate to buy one for myself when my HP conked out. I'm glad I did because it is fantastic!",0
Me agrado todo el funcionamiento de la computadora,0
"UPDATED REVIEW: So I've owned this laptop for about a year now, and I'd like to add a few more details about my experience with it after so long, as most reviews are given after a few days or weeks and I thought this would be helpful. Specifically I want to talk about a couple of cons I've come across. The two biggest issues I've had with the machine so far have just been Windows 10 breaking down and not due to the Zenbook's actual hardware, so I won't go into detail about that. However, I've still had some more minor issues with the laptop itself.The first thing I noticed was that the bezel's ever-so-slight separation and overlap of the screen sometimes traps tufts of things, at the bottom near the Asus logo. This isn't something that's worsened over time, it's just part of the build like most laptops. But it's just separated enough that it sometimes catches pieces of hair or lint that are visible and hard to pull out. You can get your fingernail in or jam a credit card in between the screen and aluminum if you wanted (wouldn't recommend). The next thing is the track pad. It works just fine 95% of the time, but if you try to two-finger scroll too fast it'll just stop working, although the other functions are still intact. The pad starts working normally if you give it a ten-second break or so and do your scrolling at a medium to slow speed. And the location of the power button on the keyboard isn't ideal. I've accidentally hit it while aiming for the backspace button a few times. Not fun. And as some other reviewers have mentioned, when the fans start going on this laptop you can sometimes hear this little clicking, like the fan is rattling something. It's not present frequently enough for it to be a deal-breaker issue for me, though.I'm still pretty happy with my purchase overall, although as time has gone on I've regretted not getting something with a touchscreen. I intend to upgrade to another laptop in the coming months and selling this one. Would still recommend this laptop for its price range.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Let me start by saying that I love this laptop, especially for the price. Maybe I'm overly impressed considering my last one was, while sturdy, about as functional as a plastic toaster from the early 2000s, but I digress. I'm giving this Asus five stars within the context of its price range, and having owned it for five months, so settle yourselves in for a chunky review.This laptop is hella thin. It's about the size of one of those expensive, medium-sized sketchbooks with only twenty pages in it, and it weighs almost nothing. It's super portable, and quiet in my experience though other reviewers have said otherwise, and the battery life is pretty good. It claims twelve hours and while it's never lasted that long yet, I've gotten to ten thus far. The display is pretty nice too, with an impressively crisp resolution, bold colours, and it has a matte finish which makes it easier on the eyes and doesn't reflect what's behind you (which I find most laptops I've seen do).It has three different USB ports which have all served me fine, and a headphone jack. I don't usually use the speakers so I can't say whether they're better or worse than anything else on the market. The keys are easy to spend lots of time typing on without ever becoming uncomfortable or clunky. I'm really happy it has a fingerprint reader as well, which I first thought was gimmicky but I use it almost exclusively now. There is no CD player for those who still use CDs on their laptop, but I am not one of those people.The contender against this Zenbook was the Macbook Air. I chose this one over it because it had the newer core processor, bigger storage, and could be opened up at the bottom without a technician if any issues were to arise – all for less money. Not to diss Apple, but every Macbook I've seen has that ultra-glossy screen and matte body which both seem to get really filthy, and this laptop has so far been easy to keep clean. The spun-metal aluminum of the Zenbook's exterior is also a finish I happen to enjoy.I wish I could brag about how fast this laptop's internet connection is, but I can't because the internet signal by default is absolute crap where I live in ye rural Canada. It's otherwise pretty fast to respond, and has faster internet compared to what I had prior. It boots up in just a few seconds which I appreciate.I have experienced only one issue with the laptop where the fingerprint scanner stopped working after a Windows 10 update. The computer seemed to have forgotten it had a fingerprint reader altogether, and I was unable to find a solution to fix this. Thankfully, a week or two later another Windows update came by and the problem disappeared. The only other small nitpick I have would be when the laptop is charging – the little orange light on the side will turn green when the battery is full, but the desktop itself when turned on will often still say 99% or one minute to full charge remaining.All in all, this Asus blows my previous five-hundred bucker wonderbread laptop out of the water. I guess this one is technically still an “economy level” computer being only $1000, but I personally think it was well worth what I paid. Would recommend.",0
"Purchased a ""New"" Dell XPS laptop that arrived in a beat up box with labels rip off. Dell Outlet stickers on the side. It appeared to be sealed so I wrapped it and figured it would be fine. Come Christmas morning, my wife opened her present, more of the internal packaging seemed to be damaged as if it was repacked. We attempted to turn it on and it's completely bricked, no lights, does not work at all. Be careful purchasing from third party sellers like this one, they purchase the items from the manufacturer outlet and advertise as new to make a profit. I now have to wait two weeks for a refund and re order the product. Unhappy husband, and though she won't admit it also an unhappy wife.",0
"This is a great product. I've had a couple of HP towers, and this Chromebook is very fast and responsive. I would buy it all over again!",0
"Be aware that this Chromebook Model # 11-v025wm (linked below) is not compatible with the Google Play Store app. While you are able to access the Play Store from the internet, you cannot download applications to the Chromebook. This was confirmed by first attempting to download applications and then speaking with HP technical support.If using Google Play Store is not a factor for you, the laptop may be okay for general internet use and to access programs on the internet.If it is an issue, the HP tech cited these two consumer HP Chromebook Model #s as being compatible with Google Play Store - 1) HP X360-11 and 2) HP X2-12. I don't know if these are bonafide models, but am passing these details along.The tech also cited the HP Chromebook HP 11G5 as a commercially available model and could not confirm its compatibility with Play Store. However, I'd previously purchased one and it was compatible, but I had to send it back because the touchpad was not consistently working.Overall, if compatibility matters to you, I would suggest doing your own research to make sure the laptop has the features you desire. Looking at the official Google Chromebooks blog for updated listings of Chromebooks compatible with Google Play Store may help.Chromebook not compatible with Google Play Store from my experience:",0
Unit felt cheaply made. TouchPad was defective. Research showed that others had experienced the same problem. Returned it.,0
This is the worst laptop I have ever owned. Im so disappointed. I've wanted a new laptop for so long and this is what I get. Now I'm stuck with a laptop I just received but can't even use. It's super slow. But I'd deal with everything else I hate about it if I had to but what I cant deal with is that I CANT SCROLL! UP OR DOWN OR AT ALL! SO NOW IM PUTTING IT BACK IN BOX AND IT'LL BE A CLOSET DECORATION I GUESS. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,0
"so far I'm loving the laptop, I ended up adding another ssd to it,Not a fan of the where the ports are located, it would of been nice of the power port was in the backFYI, you can use the MSI software to switch the FN and windows key.

Performance wise, pretty good, I had no issues running games on high/ultra, games like COD, battlefield 5, Halo the master cheif collection.

"This laptop is advertised as a gaming laptop, however, it works great for home use for things such as video streaming, virtual education, and working from home.This laptop is definitely fast, lightweight, and has great connectivity options. It has an automatic startup menu to help get everything programmed in and set up when it's turned on for the first time.I'm not too tech savvy, and I was able to open this laptop and get everything set up the way it needed to be. Technology has definitely changed, and this is pretty close to plug and play!My kids are able to do virtual meetings and classes with this laptop without the video lagging or stalling like it does on other other computer.Of course, you have to load on things like Word, Excel, Adobe, etc. But these all work great on this computer once added.Don't let the ""gaming"" title of this computer throw you off. I'm sure it's great for gaming because it runs very quickly, but it's also a reasonably priced laptop that is great for home office and school use.",0
"I like the business look I like that it look professional. Its my first game and video editing laptop. The laptop is fast already and I overkill it by boasting the memory ram to 32g. I open 4 program and run it and this thing was fast no glitch. I like the ability to monitor the cpu, ram, and storage plus much more with lenevo program. The fan are pretty quiet when surfing the internet and watching YouTube. When gaming you can here the fan but its not loud at all i was impress. What I dislike so far is the battery life at 85% I can only run my game about an hour and the battery will be dead. Its okay though I knew the battery was a lower model and I expected it to last a short time.",0
great laptop for the money,0
very nice has what i need,0
"This was purchased to replace my old ROG, which age and Windows 10 is slowly killing. Only complaint is that when playing a resource taxing game, the fans sound like I am on a jet. Cooling pad needs to be used to reduce fan noise. The slim size is the tradeoff with the cooling issue.",0
"The TN panel that comes with the laptop is absolutely horrible. The color reproduction is acceptable at most, and its contrast is straight up garbage town. Even when you look at the panel dead on, you can still see color shifting at corners of the screen. You will not be using this laptop for any professional work; even media consumption is average at most. The performance of the laptop, however, deserves praise. The GTX 1050 inside do wonders when it comes to graphic demanding tasks like games. GTA V can be ran smoothly on this at about 60 FPS on high settings. If your budget allows, I would take a look at the Dell XPS 15, for a couple hundred more dollars, it gives you a better screen and a better build quality.",0

"I bought this as a lightweight travel option, If you are just watching movies on the plane and writing emails on the beach, this is great. However the battery life is short to say the least. I can see the life drain from the battery watching movies.For this pricepoint, it is a good machine.",0

"All the Right Boxes and a Lot of PC for the Money!UPDATE, I have had this computer for seven months now and its still working perfectly and have also stalled Windows 11 Insider. True its not my main computer for Photoshop but still gets its share of use with no problems.(Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-36UT Slim Laptop | 15.6"" Full HD Display | 11th Gen Intel Core i3-1115G4 Processor | 4GB DDR4 | 128GB NVMe SSD | WiFi 6 | Amazon Alexa | Windows 10 Home (S Mode)For a computer of this size and configuration it is an amazing unit with speed and versatility I would not have expected. Topping that off is a second drive bay which will take a HDD or SSD drive up to 2Tb and even upgrade the existing 128 GB M2 can be swapped out for larger main C Drive. It also has a slot to add another stick of ram. As a 15 inch the computer is quite light and thin making it easy to carry around. There are four USB (one USB C, one USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0) along with a HDMA and headphone outputs. And of course its got Alexa!With an Intel I3 running at over four GHz it is very fast and booting up I clocked at 12.5 seconds after a five second hold on the start button. I do photoshop and video so made a test comparing it with my main work computer to render a 25 image 2.55 minute video slideshow with music with all images in the 10 to 20 MB range. My bench mark has Intel I5 and a dedicated Gforce graphic processor.Results: my benchmark rendered the video in 59.8 seconds. This Acer came in very well at 1:16.3 minute which is remarkable considering the price difference of my benchmark. Doing light to medium video and photo touch up this will be more than up to the task.One important thing to note is that this comes set up in Windows 10 “S” mode which can be changed. S mode is set up as a more secure PC by limiting all apps to what is in the Microsoft Store. What this means is you are locked in to the EDGE browser, non Microsoft photo editors or music players for example. If you are good with that then leave it as is.If not, it is an easy change to turn it into a full fledged Windows 10 PC and takes only a couple minutes BUT when you do that you will not be able to go back to S mode. Just search Microsoft S mode and a link will tell you how to turn off S.",0
"It’s an amazing product that Ive been looking for . Light , powerful and stylish. Definitely recommend!",0
"Seems nice for the money. My kids 15 & 12 haven't complained about this yet and they scrutinize everything, so I guess it's pretty good.",0
The laptop was buggy from day one. When I tried Lenovo help desk they told me the warranty expired before my date of purchase. Tried contacting the company thinking they might have been scammed too. Their lack of response seems to indicate they're at fault.,0
It not useful to me since I can’t find a alternative app to publisher to run on android systems,0
I didn't like moving the cursor around with my fingers. That is why I bought myself a wireless mouse. It is easier for me since I am older and used to a mouse. Otherwise I love it. Wanted to use it for ancestry.com. So much better to have a larger screen (15.6) than a small one that I was using on my Kindle.,0
Used for general gaming. very happy with it until it just didnt turn on one day. replaced the cord and it still wouldnt turn on. so. yeah. rather put -out :(,0
"Bought this laptop in 2020 and everything was awesome until I added an M.2 to the open slot. After adding the M.2 everything worked fine for about an hour then Bluescreen and restart. After restarting the new drive would not be visible or accessible, not even in bios. I updated and followed the suggested tweaks that other people that are having the same issue on the forums. the best I can get out of the Laptop with the new M.2 installed is about 2 reboots a day instead of every hour. When I pull it out the laptop works fine. So, in short, make sure you upgrade your Acer gaming laptops before your warranty is gone.",0
"I recently purchased this computer for this school year. Prior to purchase, I used a 2007 MacBook Air which was slow and laggy, and close to its deathbed. Originally was looking at the new MacBook Pro, but I found this amazing beast of a laptop and never looked back. I purchased the GTX 1070 with 32GB storage and 512 SSD and it costed about 2500$ which is definitely on the pricier size but in comparison to the MacBook Pro 2018 model with 512 GB storage which runs about 2800$, the MSI is cheaper while also having an amazing 144hz monitor with a faster graphics card (GTX 1070 vs Radeon Pr 555). On the user ability side, the MSI GS65 is smooth and is easy to use straight out from the box. There is some bloat ware preinstalled but it’s easy to remove either manually or using the clean start provided by the Windows software. I use this laptop for day to day college use and it’s large screen (15.6” vs. MacBook Pro 15.4”) and relatively light weight (4.14lbs or 1.87kg) makes it easy to transport and use in any setting. I also have several big box games installed including Assassins Creed Odyssey and Destiny 2 and they run amazingly well. I’ve heard that people have some problems with the build quality, including some creaking in around the touch pad, but I personally have not had this problem. If you do, amazon return is an easy fix! People also have said that it runs a bit hot, but I have not found this to be a problem as the fans do a great job at cooling it down to a comfortable heat when playing games. It is otherwise cool and completely silent when doing day to day tasks. If you’re in the market for a new computer and value productivity as well as gaming, this laptop is definitely the right purchase for you. I found that the 32GB/512SSD storage option is the right size for me and if you play a decent amount of larger games, I’d recommend this storage amount over anything else smaller. Amazing top quality laptop with a sleek design that is perfect for any student or professional that values productivity and gaming!",0
"We bought this Lenovo Chromebook for our daughter (mandatory at her middle school), and the battery failed to hold a charge and the Chromebook won't operate unless plugged in. We sent it back to Lenovo for repair and it came back with the repair ticket stating the battery has been replaced. In the meantime, while it was getting ""repaired"", the warranty ran out. I contacted Lenovo to let them know the Chromebook battery is still not working properly and they informed me the warranty has run out, so I must contact a local service center and pay for repairs. I contested the warranty claim, since it still had the same problem as before, so therefore it was not fixed and it should still be ""under warranty"" with the original repair claim date. I was given another phone number to call, which subsequently does not work. I'd stay away from this particular product and Lenovo.",0
"When the laptop arrived it didn't turned on, so I thought it was damaged. But then I saw people with a similar problem and I had to remove the back cover and disconnect the battery and connect it again. After that, the laptop worked just fine. Excellent screen quality and very fast processing.",0

Everything worked fine out of the box. I've had it for a few weeks, and have been using Office on it mainly, but also Photoshop/Illustrator/Indesign. I tried streaming video to a Roku and it works well for that as well. I haven't experienced the problems that others have reported with the trackpad or fingerprint reader - both are working fine for me. Battery life has been adequate, but I'm not using it as a primary work computer. The fan can get noisy when doing processor-intensive tasks, but for web browsing or lighter tasks it is mostly silent.",0

"Although this laptop gets great reviews, and is an Amazon recommendation...I bought 2 and both failed, and by that I mean totally bricked, (no screen and no combination of keystrokes will recover this condition). The first failed after about two weeks, I figured it was a fluke and returned it for a replacement. The second one failed with in 24 hours, exact same failure, Curiously the first was preloaded with Windows 11, the replacement came with Windows 10 and required an update. I don't know if Amazon has a warehouse of defective units, but this is unacceptable. BTW, I spent 40+ years in IT I realize the low cost of this unit probably means some cheap components, but really? So unless you enjoy standing in line at UPS for returns...avoid this POS",0
I will give it some more time I guess but am really considering sending this back. I can't believe how crappy the screen quality is. My 5+ year old fire tablet has better video quality than this thing. The last laptop I bought was in 2010... is it a requirement now that you need to spend $1000+ for anything decent?,0
"I purchased this device on a whim, having dealt with MSI's graphics cards when building my own rigs. This comes at a price well worth the specs that are on this portable, powerful product. From benchmark testing this thing for a few on my high demanding games I've got to say it comes up to snuff. The thing does get loud when you run it through its paces but that's what you get when you've got a high end graphics card in the thing. It won't give you the best graphics settings to most new games but you can run this baby on high without having to worry too much.",0

"After much research and debating which Chromebook was right for me, I decided on the Samsung Chromebook 3 and here are my reasons why:Price - I saw this on sale at my local walmart which prompted me to look into getting a Chromebook in the first place. I am a regular Mac user (Macbook Air 13"") but wanted something cheap enough I wouldnt have to worry about losing or breaking it.Battery life, speed, display and software were my additional top reasons why I went for the Samsung. The battery life is incredible and literally lasts all day, not to mention it charges to 100% in about an hour and a half. The performance of this thing honestly blows me away! This device is mainly used for web browsing and pages load quickly, animations are swift and not laggy. This thing reminds me of my Macbook Air in regards to web browsing and light tasks.The display is crisp and bright, setup literally takes under a minute, its fast, cheap, charges fast, lasts forever. The trackpad literally feels just like my Macbook Air's and that makes me so happy. I don't feel like I have to relearn how to use this trackpad; it feels right at home in comparason the the Air.I also love how if there isnt any WiFi near by I can use my hotspot from my iphone.Buy this thing if you want a cheap, snappy web browser on-the-go. I am beyond impressed with this little machine, I would absolutly buy this again!",0

It's infuriating that they give reviewers free products and they go down a list of all the other products they got for free that they ASSUME work with this machine.Oddly enough, I had a 2012 Acer predator desktop that didn't work with crucial ssd's. Good desktop besides that's. What's Acer's beef with Micron? Decade later with the exact same issues.After getting the Samsung SSD, everything works perfect. Form factor is impressive, battery is par for a gaming laptop (what do you expect from the thirsty specs?), doesn't get super hot, the fans keep it comfortable below 80 most of the time, even with performance mode and demanding games. It's only pushing a 1080 screen, but with the 144 hz it looks so good.**Original Review**This laptop was too good to be true for me.11th gen i7, 3060, 16 gb ram. High power support for 3060. If you're looking to add an SSD to add storage like I was, do your homework. Amazon and Acer have pigeon holed so many of these same named models into the same listing that it's nearly impossible to find help for your specific model online. Besides that it was a great machine. Venting was phenomenal, battery was excellent for a gaming laptop.I ordered a crucial ssd to put into the extra slot, my predator came with the slot for an extra SSD, a ribbon to plug into the motherboard, and screws to attach the SSD to the mount. I thought it had been bricked initially. Completely unresponsive, fans running 100%, screen flickered once to a different shade of black. Rewatched ACER's own video on how to install it to see if I missed a step, it wasn't rocket science.Had to unplug the battery, unplug my extra hard drive, replug in the battery and allow it to charge for a bit. Somehow the battery life tanked over the course of 30 minutes.Did all the no brainer trouble shooting items like install the latest bios update, try hardrive in another machine to isolate the issue.I came across two different possible reasons for my particular issue. In a random review from a different year and completely different backplate to the laptop a consumer reported that Acer had shipped his Predator with the wrong SSD ribbon, they had shipped him one ment for the Swift laptop. When they traded him out it seemed to fix his issue.Reading another thread, a user had my same issue from a few years ago as well. Acer had told him to change the boot sequence in the bios. It was trying to boot from the blank/reformatted secondary ssd. I reformatted the SSD I was trying to add in a different machine. Whenever the SSD was plugged in, the laptop simply would t respond. It was a black screen and button presses did nothing. There wasn't even the short bios flash you usually get. Even tried spamming F11 and del to try and blindly access it.I spent most of today trying to get it to work. I loved my first Acer back in 2012 and a few others after and was excited to come back to them. For the price and feature set it is an unreal value, but I specifically chose this over the MSI I was eyeballing because of the secondary ssd bay. I can't wait another month for a replacement, only to have the replacement have the same issue. There's no support. I need to send it back and just pony up the money for a brand with better support. Flukes are frustrating but blindly trying to fix a brand new device is even worse.",0
"One month after purchase, all 3 standard USB 3.0 ports started having issues. Devices plugged into the ports will disconnect unless the cord was oriented properly and precisely (possibly a lose connection?). I've tried disabling USB selective settings, checking the drivers, and even physically trying to tighten the USB ports by pulling the USB port clamps up with a screwdriver. None of it seemed to have an effect.The problem mostly has an effect on the laptop's portability as moving it about causes the USB devices to disconnect and reconnect. On a flat surface like a desk, this problem is pretty much solved, but devices such as my Oculus Rift S VR headset seem to simply not work as Windows 10 ""doesn't recognize this USB device."" Hoping to avoid returning it, so if anyone has experienced this please let me know and how you dealt with the problem. Thank you.",0
"Arrived earlier than expected; it's light, looks great, and perfect for working from home!",0
Gear fit and finish. Very well known brand that holds up to its name well.,0
Bought this laptop a little over a year ago and the computer has had numerous issues with randomly shutting off and going to a blue screen. Found out that the warranty for this product expired before I even purchased the product. Tried contacting the seller numerous times and they refuse to respond to any communication!,0
Great light weihjt and fast laptop,0
"track pad was flaky and sometimes completely unresponsive for 3-10 seconds, and then work again for a short period of time before becoming unresponsive again.",0
"It's a very good budget gaming laptop. Make sure you buy an extra 8 gb stick of ram (I bought crucial) and it'll unlock the full speed of the laptop. Also make sure the Nvidia drivers are up to date and activate coolboost on the control panel. I just have a keyboard issue that seems to be a common problem. For example when I play a video game and I try to sprint, the W button will stop working or have some input lag in it. Seems to be the only key that has an issue so we will see what other buttons have a problem. If someone has a solution to this I'd be very happy.",0
"This purchase has not been impressive at all, it was a pain in the behind to set up and get going. I'm pretty sure it was a dysfunctional unit that they sent me, it was sent in windows S mode and no way to upgrade to windows home without app store, and the app store simply would not load at all. I updated all the drivers and got all the windows updates, the store still wouldn't work so I couldn't install a thing on it that was not from the app store.I basically had to install my own Windows version on it then get all the drivers manually again.....imagine taking hours and hours on a brand new laptop just to set it up.",0

"Good value for the money. I've now had this chromebook for over a year and a half and have had no problems with it. It's light, sturdy, very comfortable to use with very decent sound, mic, camera for video conferencing. This is my 3rd chromebook, and usually after a year, the screen, mouse, keyboard, or SOMETHING starts to act up. No such issues this time around. I use it everyday, primarily for work-related tasks. The screen-size is decent, but I also have a Chromecast so I can just ""beam"" my computer onto my big screen TV whenever I want to. This is my first Lenovo device ever, and when the time comes to replace/upgrade this chromebook, I'm probably going to pick another Lenovo.",0
"At first I was hesitant to get a refurbished laptop. I previously purchased a new unit last year also a Dell XPS 13. Unfortunately it was stolen. I am so satisfied with the Dell XPS 13 that I bought a slightly newer model, however refurbished. The new unit is simply beyond my budget. Honestly, I think there is no difference between a new unit and this certified refurbished unit.",0
work great! don't believe the negative reviews.,0
"I just received this HP laptop and was pretty impressed with it from the get go. The construction is durable aluminum and is aesthetically pleasing. The keyboard is laid out perfectly and the buttons are also aluminum so not bulky or clumsy. The 17"" Screen is a bit bigger than my last laptop, a 15"" Sony VAIO (which lasted me seven or eight years and had a blu-ray drive) but I like the 17"" screen better than my old VAIO, especially when streaming Netflix, Hulu or Prime Video. It looks like pretty good 1080P or even 4K resolution to me but without a 4K or blu-ray disc in the drive, guess I cannot be absolutely sure. It is kind of heavy at maybe five or six pounds but that's not a big deal IMO. And it does fit nicely in a carry on size leather laptop briefcase that I used for my VAIO, so if you are on a trip and flying, it will store in the overhead no problem, possibly under the seat as well. the battery life is pretty good. Last night I had a full charge and was surfing the web for six or seven hours and noticed it was not draining beyond the 50% level at all. It comes with a lot of programs pre-installed but if you are like me and would rather customize your own apps, that was a snap...did it all in one night. In short, I had been looking at another VAIO but I had reservations because Sony no longer owns the brand so who knows if they will even be around in three four years. Plus, I'm solidly a Windows user, especially 10 and this model is built for Windows 10. One last thing, the startup is a breeze and the laptop is very quiet. You won't be disappointed...and I did shop around quite a bit before purchasing this.",0
My son uses it for college,0
Purchased new and it wouldn’t ever start. Returned it.,0
"for general use like watching movies or on the web to whatever I needed to do this laptop was amazing the screen gets bright, keypad feels great but.. sometimes I find myself needing to charge it often but personally I dont like it to get below 50% For gaming, this can handle itself pretty good but you will not be able to play your favorite game on the max settings but for me its awesome,so I will be sticking to this acer laptop maybe even newest versions when this dies",0
This laptop exceeds my expectations.. Also paid .99 a month for extra 100 storage. Bought not new but when opened up when I received it looked new to me.,0
trackpad is loose and rattles when touching.,0

"I love this laptop, I play Sims 4 on it, I’ll do the advanced games later. Only negative thing is the shotty battery , I timed it from 100% down to 10% when the low battery Signal would come on, it lasted only an hour and 54 minutes, for a laptop that cost a total of $730 I would expect a way better battery life at least eight hours worth. But so far that is my only discrepancy.",0
"Very good product. It doesn’t have a touch screen like it says, but I don’t care about that. Been using it as my primary computer for months now and it has help up extremely well for less than half the cost of a new lenovo. Absolutely worth the money in my eyes!",0

"Was trying to purchase this laptop but multiple listings appeared. FYI, the other listings are from third-party sellers or distributors. Nothing wrong with third-party sellers and if you want to purchase from a third-party seller that is up to you. If you try to go to other listings and go under the ""Buy Now"" buttons, third-party sellers will have a section that says ""ships from/sold by"". This listing does not, so it is sold by the actual Dell store. Also, if you can, buy this laptop when it has a discount. I bought it at an unfortunate time and the price dropped $200 after it shipped. I was able to return it and repurchase with the discount.",0

"Bought this for my son. His first year of school was with a very old laptop that was more geared to gaming. He ending up hating that laptop when he needed actually needed it to be portable. But that allowed him to define what he really wanted and needed a new unit to do. He wanted a smaller screen (<15""), lightweight, longer battery life. This hits all those points, is quite stylish, plus more. It was expensive, and my major concern with it is that there is no replaceable battery. This travels almost like a tablet, but definitely feels like a notebook computer. He loves it.",0

"Edit 2: have been using the laptop for few month. No issues at all. Love it. Will move it back to 4 stars..........Edit 1: I was so happy with this laptop and put an amazing review. After 10 days, this vertical line appeared and it's constant through all applications, even in Bios. Meaning this is a hardware defect. Will change my review to one star for poor quality control. I have returned the laptop and Amazon honored 30 day return window. The new units doesn't have this line. Will see if the same problems happens in the next few weeks.............................If you're not willing wait to RTX 3000. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. The build quality is good. Fan is quite and powerful. Love it.I've been using the laptop now for a week. It's much better than what I thought. Super quite when you need it be quite. Powerful when you need it to be powerful. I actually returned the Helios 300, which I bough for 999 as well on a deal. Helios 300 has RTX 2060 which is not so different from 1660 Ti (Don't let them fool you). .With helios noise at idle is just unbearable, Intel heat is ridiculous as well and the build quality doesn't come close Legion 5. Legion 5 Beats it at all the way. .",0

"After a month of use, I can confidently say that this is an excellent laptop. All games I've played on it automatically recommend max graphics, and they play perfectly. Just be sure to update all drivers once you unbox, since the preinstalled ones are out of date by now. I've had no hardware or performance issues.The laptop does get a little warm when playing newer games on max settings, so I'd recommend getting a cooling pad. But even without a cooling pad, I've had no heat warnings or issues, so I might just be overly cautious.",0

User error.",0
The most impressive thing is the start time. It opens everything in seconds. I will use it for browsing and watching online content. I feel the 8gb will be more than okay for what I'm using it for. The build quality is also very good. So far loving my purchase!,0

"If you don’t upgrade the ram from 32 to 64 your fans will be running nonstop and the laptop will get hot and run slow. But once updated all that won’t happen anymore.

When it arrived I rushed home, ready to finally have an upgraded piece of technology, only for the screen to go black than white with a yellow caution sign telling me Chrome OS was defective or missing! Overall, extremely disappointed and I didn't want a replacement at the risk of this happening again so I returned it. Glad I did this through Amazon as their return policy is really forgiving and quick.",0

"This computer is easily the worst purchase I have made in my life. Within weeks the cheap quality becomes apparent as the trackpad will start being unresponsive, the screen becomes flimsy, the battery drains, and so much more. To boot, the customer service is horrendous.I sent my computer (under warranty) to be fixed by Acer for the many issues that arise within a year. Be warned of the following:- They will not pay for shipping to their repair center (about $70).- They will likely void your warranty. In my case they stated my computer had ""physical damage"". This physical damage was a small scratch and bend on back cover of the screen (and has nothing to do with the repairs needed).- They will charge you a $386 fee to repair your computer (more than half the price of the computer) and offer no option for refund instead.- The customer service phone line will hang up on you, put you on endless hold, and redirect you in circles to different departments.Do yourself a favor and buy from a better company. I tried finding a cheaper option from my previous Apple and this was the biggest mistake and downgrade I have ever made with a laptop.",0

I am so disappointed in this purchase. I thought I was making a good decision buying this laptop. Boy I was wrong. I thought spending $1000 dollars on a laptop I would get something semi superior and reliable. Within 2 to 3 days owning this laptop everything was going fine until all of a sudden out of nowhere the screen went black and haven't been able to fix it since. Lenovo says they're coming to my residence to replace a component. They said by Wednesday so let's see.,0
"Pro's-----1. 3.27# for a 16"" 2-in-1 machine, can't beat that.2. 2560x1600 WQXGA, 16:10 aspect ratio3. Two PCIE 4.0 M.2 SSD slots, the Samsung PM9A1 MZVL22T0HBLB specs are pretty impressive, within a few hairs of a Samsung 980 Pro. I have a 4TB Sabrent Rocket Q4 in the second slot4. LG utilities, particularly LG Smart Assistant, are an improvement over the 11th Gen 2021 models. Can now set battery powering thresholds.5. Keyboard has good depth and is very tactile and I'm very used to ThinkPads' keyboards to which it compares favorably.Con's------1. It does very much want to overheat right above the FN6 & 7 keys on the bezel, if you crack the bottom to put in a second M.2 SSD you'll see that there's plenty of room for a bigger heat sink. I pasted the CPU with Kryonaut and run a balanced power mode, also have tweaked the CPU with ThrottleStop and now it runs like a charm.2. Glossy screen, should have been matte.3. The 32GB RAM is a big step over the stop-gap 16t90p-k.aab7u1 2021 model with 16GB RAM I've been using for the past 5 months.4. Definitely should have come with Win11 Pro instead of Home. If you have an old Win7 or Win10 Pro key you can upgrade for free, easily enough Googled on how to do that.Fix the above con's and it's definitely in MacBook Pro, ThinkPad killer territory.",0
Not even close to the description.,0
So when I received the computer I got started downloading everything playing some games and stuff. I noticed the screen acting weird and next day the screen is going in and out of working. It took 2 days for my screen to not work. The hardware in this laptop is great. But the quality of the build is why the price is good for this laptop. Screen is really flimsy and if you want to carry this in my backpack. I wouldn’t do it because it’s gonna flex. I ended up returning this because I just don’t want to deal with this issue at all in the future.,0

"I received my laptop today and loved it. The only problem is that when I plug in my head phones, it seems to not recognize it and will play the sound from the speakers instead. I have not yet tried it with any other head phones, but when I do and if they work I will change my review. If they do not work, I guess I'll just have to return it. Pretty disappointing.",0
"I like this laptop. This is the third Lenovo computer that I have purchased. The laptop is light weight and the keypad feels good. One note though, I could not run Bitdefender because the laptop did not have enough Ghz. It does come with 30 days of McAfee.Another note: the touch pad does not have a scrolling feature. You can set it to scroll using two fingers on the touch pad. This takes some time to get used to. Despite the lack of these features, I still like the laptop.",0

"I love this laptop. Don't get windows 11. I found this laptop at a microcenter with a much better graphics card 3070 and a better battery life but I couldn't have it on hold as long as I needed to to go and get it. This computers battery is atrocious. Don't use while it's unplugged for a long time. It comes pre loaded with a lot of bloatware. I downloaded a third party application that makes it so that way you can lower the refresh rate to 60htz or your computer dies from full charge in 30 minutes. After making it so I can switch from 165htz -> 60htz the battery life lasts about 3 hours more. Like any other gaming laptop, it gets extremely hot. Oh and back to the refresh rate, this is advertised as 165htz which looks great but if you go to change it in window's settings, you can't change it to anything else. That's why I downloaded that other software. It's upgradable which is why I got it. I put in another ssd, of course you have to partition but it works perfectly. I put more ram in, and it's a beast, but with power distribution (because it's a laptop) the hardware will never be completely utilized to the fullest unless you overclock everything while plugged in. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE IT PLUGGED INTO IT'S GIGANTIC, HEAVY BRICK CHARGER IT'S COMPLETELY WORTH IT!",0
I picked up two of these and have been very happy with the performance to date. I use them for Cad Cam work and find the graphics and overall speed very capable. I would recommend this laptop to a friend. Side note: There is a zippered case included that I did not find until the second laptop purchased. Threw the first one out inadvertently due to the way it was packaged.,0

"I wanted so badly to give this 5 stars but it has no MUX switch! I don't know how you miss something so important on your flagship laptop when your lower end models have it, but it's a huge oversight by Gigabyte.I love the feel of the mechanical keyboard, the RGB is nice and bright, although it seems to constantly change back to the default RGB profile causing you to have to go back into the app to change it back to what you had it set to. But overall the keyboard is just an absolute pleasure to type with and game on. My End key wasn't quite seated all the way in, but one firm press and it was good to go. The keyboard isn't overly loud like don't mechanical keyboards, but it's by far my favorite part of this laptop.The 3080 in it is actually very capable even though it's only 105w when boosted. I've not run into any issues with any games I've played and since it's only a 1080p display you'll always be above 60fps in any game where fps matters, and with it being a lower watt GPU that definitely attributes to this laptop always feeling as cool as it does.The case feels very nice and sturdy. I'm a truck driver and it feels extremely durable in such an environment. It doesn't get hot at all really, but the fans are rather loud under load. Not an issue for me as if I'm playing something that taxes the system that hard, I'm using a headset anyway. But the feel and texture of this metal they used on the case feels fantastic to me and just makes it feel like a more upscale laptop.The battery life is, well, it's a gaming laptop. You won't be using this thing on battery power except in a pinch. But if you do find yourself needing to, there is a battery saver mode that I've gotten 3 easy hours out of watching movies on a flight, but if you're planning on gaming on battery power for whatever reason, there are better options. That's not what this device is suited toThe screen quality is good. Not great but good. Colors are decent, and there's several different color temp profiles so you can customize it somewhat, and you can calibrate it if needed but mine was fine out of the box. The big issue with the screen is the response time. At higher refresh rates you will see some ghosting I've noticed, as is the price you pay with an IPS monitor. It's not bad, but coming from my previous laptop is definitely noticeable and something to keep in mind. I've not noticed any backlight bleed which is really impressive for an IPS monitor.Overall, for the price I paid, ($2149) it's a fantastic value for the money, except for that ONE THING... No MUX switch. An absolutely inexcusable oversight in 2022 on a flagship gaming laptop, and the one thing holding it back from a 5 star rating.",0
"When I bought this laptop, I was using an Intel 4th Gen core i5 HP for college. This Lenovo felt like a MASSIVE upgrade to it. The anti-glare screen is great if you are like me who spends hours every day in front of your PC, the battery life is good, 5 hours or so. Rapid charge helps it recharge really fast and what I particularly like is I can use hybrid mode for everyday tasks and turn it off to use the dedicated graphics when I'm gaming. Hybrid mode conserves battery and when it's off battery life is about 3 or 3.5 hours.I think it's an amazing product and would recommend it if like me, you code and game at night.",0
"This is an exceptionally well configured laptop for general use plus gaming, video/photo work, and demanding applications. If you work with exceptionally large spreadsheets, like to have 40 tabs open in Chrome, edit videos or photos at an advanced level, and like to relax and game when you can -- this is a fine choice.The system was very nicely packaged and boxed. Setup was quick and easy. This was my first experience with Cortana assisted setup and it was mostly positive. Basic setup took about five minutes. Later it took another 20-30 minutes for all the windows updates to apply, but everything was fairly automatic and worked flawlessly (you have to start the windows updates yourself, which is good). The system seems pretty clean, not loaded with junkware which is great!I tweaked a few power settings to taste and that was about it. The power button does ""sleep"" by default and I left it as is. Though I normally prefer my power button set to shutdown, I left it this way because of the location. It is located right where the DEL key would usually be, so I thought better to leave it set for sleep in case I hit it accidentally (it functions instantly when pressed). Sleep and wake is nearly instantaneous.The screen is sharp and clear. Text at the recommended 125% setting is very readable. The maximum brightness is not as bright as some notebooks I've owned, but seems sufficient for normal indoor use. Not sure about bright sun, could be an issue there as screen is reflective. But that is a minor thing as I rarely use my notebook outdoors.Having a big 512GB SSD is wonderful (I've only had 256GB SSD before this) and 16 GB of RAM is also a big plus. Rarely would anyone ever need more than that. This makes for snappy disk reads and writes and no worries about memory cache and flushing. The SSD has 445 GB free out of 475 GB, normal for this size SSD and windows 10. The SSD is a Samsung which is a highly rated brand and very fast.In my opinion, the 1080p panel is a great fit, especially if you'll be gaming. Although the 4k panel has better color gamut and higher res, the Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti is much better suited for the 1080p resolution. Also, I find the 1080p resolution to be more realistic for everyday work. Viewing angles on the screen seem good and the brightness and colors look fine as well. The 1050 Ti can drive it well for moderate to high gaming (and even Ultra with some games). Almost any 2016 game will run great and most newer games will as well. The Nvidia driver is 376.20 and seems fine. I left things as is for now. [Note: Hard core gamers will want a 1060 or higher card, but this card is fine for me and makes gaming very pleasurable. I have owned many high end gaming rigs in my day. These days, I'm happy just to have fun and not obcess over maximum performance. YMMV.]The fan runs nearly all the time, but is almost inaudible until you are very active. Then the sound is a typical low fan sound and not objectionable. (Silent is always better, but if the fans are going to run, I'm glad they are steady. I've had laptops where the fans cycle up and down all the time and it was very annoying.) I could hear no other noises of any kind in normal use (Have not stress tested yet - will update when I do.) The touchscreen works very well. The keyboard also feels good to me (I'm not a touch typist, however I do type fairly rapidly). No problems with flexing at all. [Note: If you press fairly hard you can make it flex very slightly at the top, but in normal use, I see none.] Layout is mostly standard with a few quirks like the power key and a large Fn key in the lower right.Then you have the truly excellent i7 7700HQ 2.8GHz quad-core processor which blazes and will Turbo-boost to 3.8 GHz! And all of this in a very attractive case. I have always thought Asus made very nice looking laptops and this one is right up there with the best. It has nicely beveled edges and everything feels very solid. No hot spots, everything very cool under normal use. A nice looking rig in my opinion. It even has an illuminated logo! :)I was very happy to see the glass-like (not sure if it's glass or not?) track pad - I love them. So much nicer. And the illuminated keyboard is well done (you can set various brightness levels) and a must at this price point. Then there are the very good speakers and the very generous selection of ports, especially in such a thin notebook.The array of ports on this thing is simply excellent. Getting two USB 3.1 C (Gen 2) Thunderbolt ports is exceptional. While I would have preferred a standard SD card vs. the microSD card (note the description here on Amazon is confusing, but it is microSD, not SD), that's minor and not a real issue for me. (I have several USB 3 card readers on hand.) You also get 2 USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, and an audio jack. Everything you need.The Nvidia GTX 1050Ti with 4 GB of RAM is an excellent choice for the 1080p 15.6"" screen. It can handle this resolution well. It's overkill for most daily activities (and indeed you will often be using the internal Intel GFX vs the 1050Ti), but will be very welcome when you get into demanding apps and games. With about twice the power of a 960M this thing is no slouch. I need to drive external monitors on occasion and the 1050 Ti will be a big help with that, also.Have I mentioned how thin this monster is? For the amount of power you are getting, it's amazing that they could squeeze it into such a thin chasis. The screen hinges work great, easy enough to open, but still stiff enough to support touch use. And it's interesting that it supports the ASUS Pen, a nice plus. I don't have one (yet), but that could add a nice touch later for photo editing, painting/drawing. and such.So, an excellent notebook with many nice features. I will be running more tests and exploring it in more depth and will come back and update this review with my findings as I go. But my ""out of the box"" take is - wow! - fantastic! This thing is pretty much my dream machine, it has everything I've wanted in a great package. It's a very balanced configurationUpdate: Rewrote parts of the above to add more info and clarity. (#2 - a few more updates above.)Update: Battery life -- I have not run a full test as yet, but based on my early use, I would say 8-10 hours is very reasonable to expect for just normal use. I would imagine that will decrease if doing anything that fires up the Nvidia 1050 Ti for long periods. I will have a better take on this in time and I will come back and update based on more experience ASAP. Right now I see 8 hours as almost certain, so will have to see how far above that we can go.-- Here are my best estimates for battery life. These are just educated guesses, based on my light use so far, but I think they should be pretty close. I will update if any changes as I have more experience.---- 8-12 hours mixed use (web browsing, movies, some gaming, other normal uses)-- 8-10 hours movie and video watching-- 3-5 hours gaming or heavy loads-- More than 10 hours light use, web browsing, email. editing documents/spreadsheets, and such-- Note: Since sleep and awaken are very fast, using sleep judiciously could extend these times easily.This is, in my opinion, outstanding for a machine this powerful. I'm very pleased with the battery life I'm seeing.*** Geek Notes: ***The GTX 1050 Ti is about 1/3 faster than the previous 1050. It is not VR ready, you'll need a 1060 for that.The Intel i7 7700HQ supports hyper-threading with up to 8 threads at once - it's an excellent performer.Some people obsess about throttling. I used to also. I don't anymore. My days of spending hours to get a 10% performance increase are over. I'm content to just relax, enjoy, and be happy. The plus is a cooler, lighter, thinner, nicer overall experience vs. a thicker, chunkier, hotter, noisier beast with short battery life. I'm OK with that. [Feel free to disagree, I had a lot of fun tweaking rigs myself, in the past, and understand the need for speed.]",0
"When I game and the GPU is in fact working hard, the laptop gets VERY hot, as does the power brick. I don’t have a flir so I cannot check the actual temps but it is hot to the touch to the point I worry about the longevity of the components inside.",0
"It's been many years since I allowed myself a new laptop, and as I usually go for a lightly used older model I'm fairly easy to please, and hardly the harshest critic of the most up to date technology.That said, the moment I pulled this laptop from its box I was in love. At a little over 1KG it's incredibly light, though because it's less than 12"" wide and 8"" deep that weight is quite concentrated. It feels dense in a way that no laptop I've ever used has felt, a hint that lots of exciting technology has been crammed into this tiny package.I don't do much intensive work day to day, but every few weeks I need to fire up Photoshop to do some fairly complex stuff that absolutely annihilates my old laptop. With 16GB of RAM and the Intel Iris Xe Graphics card this thing can stroll through the kind of work that would cause my old laptop to grind to a halt. What's more I can keep multiple processes working in the background while I work, so graphics work is no longer a grind.If you're looking for a small and extremely portable laptop that can handle anything you can throw at it, the Dell XPS 13 9310 is an excellent candidate. Yes, it's expensive, and I'm sure you can get a laptop with similar specs in a slightly less portable package for less, but I've never used a laptop with this much power that's small enough to toss in a tote bag. My only slight complaint is that it runs a little hot when you start to push it, because the heat needs to go somewhere and there just isn't enough room to dissipate it effectively. It's not enough to knock this down from a 5 star review, though. Just buy a cooling pad or raise it off the surface.",0
The keyboard is stunning and takes a little bit of getting used to,0
Easy to carry around,0
Excellent product!,0
"I will preface this review by saying that I am not much of PC gamer since I have a PS5, but I was in the market for a new laptop as we go into another year of working from home. I am in AWE of how fast, powerful and well-designed this baby is. The screen is big and has excellent display. The graphics are top notch, which is helpful to me as I take on more graphic design responsibilities for work, and the it has a very fast processor with more than enough storage and memory, that can even be upgraded to 32GB. For now the 16GB is sufficient but I love having that options. They keyboard is wonderful to type on and being able to use both Wifi and Ethernet connections at the same time means there is NOTHING that will stop you on it! There is a cooling mechanism on the bottom of the laptop for the hardcore gaming marathons so the machine runs efficiently no matter what you put it up to and it is integrated with Alexa so you have a personal assistant at the ready too!The laptop IS very expensive but the investment you make in a high-end, high-performance machine means that you will not only be able to upgrade it but also will have it for years with no problems. I am so delighted with this laptop!",0
Received the item with a defective delete key out of the box. Seller is just as bad for not responding to my message. Bad phone number.,0
"My Phone. My Car. My Acer Aspire 5. Those 3 things I use daily. I am a college student taking half of my classes online and this computer has yet to let me down. I have owned it for a little over 2 months and have seen more pros than cons. The ability to use zoom and microsoft word with it can be used extensively for schoolwork no matter the level.This is my first laptop of my own besides my high school providing us with chromebooks. They were Dell Intel Chromebook 3100 and all it did was get the job done which wasn’t in the most convenient ways. It was smaller and slower, and the difference between the two is impeccable. The quickness of the loading time and the fact it was very easy to get a hang of. As macbooks are seen as one of the best laptops in the market it is double the price at $1,000. It may not have all the specs of a macbook like connecting your iphone along to it, but it can definitely make up for it with the wireless connection being quick. This computer can also connect to an Xbox or a Samsung phone.This model is a slim build but is a little wider than a regular chromebook. If you are unsure what that could be relating to, think of a cutting board you may have in your kitchen. The elevated design of the computer for when you open it is very beneficial for when you are trying to relax and get schoolwork done without straining your neck when using it for a long time. As the elevation might not be a massive difference the half inch incline will come into effect when you least expect it and when you don’t even realize it.The battery runs a little quicker than I would like. To combat that I just have to remember to charge it overnight. Along with that sometimes the touchpad mouse drags a little bit. For example if I were clicking on a new tab sometimes it would drag the tab out and separate it from the others creating a new window. It gets really annoying when I’m trying to go back and forth between tabs for my classes and such. With a mouse I have found no problem in that area as it may be the touchpad being too sensitive. The laptop offers USB ports on each side so there won’t be an inconvenience with connecting a mouse.While this laptop is what I use for my schoolwork there have been no issues on that part. If you are looking to purchase a laptop for a reason other than school like gaming or something, this may not be the laptop for your needs. I have yet to do anything more extensive than schoolwork mainly using programs such as blackboard and launchpad. No issues there on my part.",0
I bought two of these to replace some aged laptops. I was worried because of price and there not my normal vendor. I have to say I love these laptops. I replaced the spinning rust with and SSD from my old laptops to save money. Reinstalled Windows and away we go. I have to say I like the touch pad on these more than my Macbook Pro. Normally I hate touch pads but I used it to setup the laptop. The real test if the wife and kids would like them. I keep checking in with them to see what they think and they said they like or love them as well. My daughter is like I can play all my games on max settings which the old one couldn't do. I have to give ACER a big thumbs up because my family really enjoys these laptops.,0
"I 'inherited' a Dell laptop but had four issues with it: 1) it was too heavy for me, 2) it didn't come with Microsoft Word 3) it was slow as molasses, and 4) it would not allow me to install Google Docs for some reason.What I wanted: something lightweight and portable that I could use to write (I write series novels and how-to manuals), browse online and occasionally watch Youtube videos.After doing research on many models, I landed on this Samsung Chromebook. It really is fantastic for my needs! Set-up was a breeze, all I had to do was enter my Gmail address and it was up & running! It is super lightweight so it rests comfortably on my lap or I can just toss it in a larger handbag to take it elsewhere. The size is comfortable for me, too. I'm petite and I really appreciate having something that's not so 'spread-out.' I do have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 which is 10 inches and this is only slightly bigger than it. And my absolute favorite feature is that I don't need Wifi or an internet connection to write offline using Google Drive. That's huge! I do run it off my home's Wifi, but sometimes I'll bring it to work (where the Wifi password has yet to be cracked by anyone) and I can still write during downtime.Techy stuff: it does updates automatically and it is safe & secure. Not sure about the technical terms for that but I feel comfortable using this without the worry that my personal files will be stolen or visible to anyone.",0
"I just received this laptop yesterday and today running 1hours i can feel the heat from the keyboards, so I run the app for check up the heat temperate and it got up to 57C-67C.",0

"The keyboard also stop working properly after around a year. Would I buy it again? Prob not, but I did buy it and i can't change that. It did its job with gaming and school related subjects.",0
"Fast, quality, price, touch screen, great experience. Can really lose track of the time enjoying, using this machine.",0
"I tend to prattle exhaustively so I tried to divvy up my numerous opinions into sections you might find relevant.Now/Future = I've been very pleased with this laptop, and I do consider it a great deal for the six hundy spent (on the 9th Gen Intel Core i5-9300H). Not only does it perform splendidly as it comes ""right out the box"", but it's also upgradeable in the near future as tech advances and my finances allow. I've been using it for hours on end everyday for almost one month.Multitasking = I can run WoW (weeeeee!!) while simultaneously streaming music on Spotify in my web browser. Beyond that, I can also minimize my game and music to do a quick Google on whatever boss I'm trying to squelch as I solo dungeons with my Night Elf Demon Hunter. No lag or stuttering while multitasking whatsoever. Nice. B-)Graphics quality = It comes with 2 graphics cards, so be sure to check your in-game settings to make sure the best card is selected. Streaming Netflix and running WoW are lovely in a way I wasn't able to appreciate on my previous HP laptop. My only concern is that once in a while I've seen a rolling screen dim from top to bottom for a split second before it returns to normal. It has only happened a couple of times in the past month I've owned this, so?Pre-installed software = I had to find workarounds to disable Bing and Microsoft Edge, but in the end I can now use the search box on the start bar and it opens Google results in Chrome. Those being my preferred search engine and web browser. It wasn't terribly difficult as an amateur tinkerer.Heat = Sometimes I use the laptop on my actual lap (go figure), and when I've been immersed in my addiction for 4-5 hours, it gets rather warm. Almost hot. The pre-installed Nitrosense app allows you to manage the fan settings in order to allay this. Also of note is that the heat escape is on the right side, which means south paws keep their leading hand cool and us orthodox boxers get a warm periodic reminder to move our hand away from the keyboard. In plain words: the heat from the fans blows directly where one would naturally rest one's hand on a mouse (if you use one, however, a mouse is not included).Keyboard = The keys are comfortably spaced, appropriately sensitive to touch, and all are in working condition. The value of the number pad on a laptop cannot be understated!! The red backlight on the keyboard by default times out after 30 seconds. Finding the right key to strike first on an all-black keyboard after the backlight turns off was obnoxious to me. After some searching, I found that this too is changeable in the Nitrosense app. Weird place to put it, but ok. Hit the ""(N)"" key in the top left of the number pad, then click the Settings gear inside Nitrosense, and click to toggle off the ""backlight off after 30 seconds"" option. This might not be available on every model, but take a gander.Battery life = The battery lasts for a decent amount of time when simply browsing and streaming music: several hours, give or take. But I prefer/recommend plugging in the power cord when I know I'm about to sit down for a long session of questing. (""Just one more quest!!"")Port/Cable management = Speaking of the power cable... It must have been a desperate decision to seat it on the righthand side of the laptop in the middle. The configuration of the internal hardware almost certainly has to be to blame for this. It seems like they tried to offset this inconvenience by making the power cable with a immediate 90 degree bend so you can swivel it (hopelessly) out of the way.Final summation = I listed things things that I believe could be improved which were mostly cosmetic in nature and were either adjustable or could be lived with. But on the whole, this laptop has been a game-changer for my usual activities and has truly been a ""best bang for your buck"" experience. I recommend it for anyone who is maybe moderately into gaming but mostly wants a very reliable and delightful experience.",0
"[Update 12/20/2018] I worked with Dell on this issue and finally had to send the computer back to Dell for service. They replaced the main board and the computer seems to be working fine. Credit here to Dell for standing behind their product.But going through the diagnosis and repair is a pain. The technical support people wanted to eliminate all the software possibilities so we kept trying things including a clean re-install of Windows - which wiped my machine.After we eliminated all the software possibilities, Dell sent me a box and I shipped it back to them on a Tuesday. I received the unit back on the following Wednesday.But this is all things that shouldn't have happened. The computer should have operated properly when I received it. Perhaps it was defective and was not refurbished properly. It would have been worth a few extra dollars to avoid all of this service headache.Note that this is not a ding on Dell but on the company who claimed to refurbish the computer. Dell stepped up and fixed the unit.+++++++++++++++++++[Update] I'm experiencing a problem with this computer in that it gives a Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD) occasionally. It recovers from the BSOD and goes back to normal operation. I'm working with Dell now to find a solution. They believe it's a software problem but if that were correct, it seems that everyone would be having the BSOD problem. I'll post a follow-up after I work with Dell some more. Really disappointing. I've never had a computer that was this unreliable.++++++++++++++I've only had the computer for a couple of days - it's a refurb unit. The computer was clean and unmarked - looked like new. Setup was normal and the unit functions like I'd expect a new computer to function.It was packed well and was shipped quickly. Not much else to say - I'll have to wait until I have more time with it to see if any problems crop up. I thought the price was fair considering it has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. I'll probably have to upgrade it to a 1TB SSD at some point in the future - I checked the maintenance manual and an upgrade looks pretty easy.",0
"It seems to be as light as the macair I owned a couple of years ago. It seems to do everything a mac does. I've been a mac owner for the last 19 years, and I finally succumbed to getting a windows computer to use certain programs that simply fail when using a mac, so I'm just getting used to using the windows interface. So far it seems fantastic. I love this little machine, and prefer to carry it around for email and web browsing than the mac pro because it feel so much lighter. Battery time also seems longer than my mac, but that could just be because the Asus is newer.",0
The laptop was used on about once or twice a week for homework and playing a game by my 13 y.o. granddaughter who took good care of it. Unfortunately Lanovo has no record of the sale and no warranty in effect for it. I contacted Amazon and I will be able to return it for a refund.,0
This computer is crap. Worst 170 dollars I ever spent.,0
"okay so, this laptop is honestly really good for the price. I downloaded battlefield 4 to test it, and it did fairly well, At medium settings I was getting 180-200fps constant. I was getting a few hiccups from connection though, so I’ll have to connect a Ethernet and see if the wireless wifi is the problem. The fans cooled it nice, they were a little bit loud when sitting in silence as any gaming laptop would be ,but with headphones you can’t hear anything, I played for about 2 hours while charging and it didn’t even get that warm. Now for battery, you get like 3-4 hours tops just from browser use (I did have battery save mode on, you could probably get a little more battery life using lower screen brightness but I like to keep it at around 80% and that’s the battery life I get. Quality of laptop is also super good, keyboard fees very high end",0

"It's my first Asus laptop, it's great. I was also looking at some similarly priced MSI products, but this laptop ticked all the boxes even if it was slightly more expensive. It's worth every penny.The GPU isn't underpowered like most of the laptops in this range, the screen is crisp and the unit itself just feels really sleek. It fits in my Nomatic backpack which is a rare treat - I have had trouble finding laptops with power like this that are slim enough to fit.It runs FFXIV flawlessly, the game looks gorgeous, and it handles all my VMs in the background while I am developing. In all, I love this machine and I think ASUS Tuf gear is my go to from now on. I use it for all sorts of things ranging from writing (the keyboard is laid out really nicely) to programming to gaming to watching videos and it's a pleasure to use for any task. This machine keeps me portable.",0
it would be nice if the screen could fold back or rotate so it could be used more like a tablet,0
"Any USB device we plug into this thing won't so much as power on. At first, we proceeded to make sure that everything was up to date. We started with the USB drivers, then we went onto the support page for this model and updated the chipset and all other recommended drivers. We then confirmed that the BIOS was already up to date and even updated Windows 10 to its latest build.After all that, the problem still persisted. We checked our USB devices by trying them in 2 other laptops...they were working, no surprise there. We spent a few more hours researching the issue online and double checked that we did everything we could, including adjusting the relevant power management settings in Windows, but still nothing.We consider having functioning USB ports a big deal on this model, since it doesn't come with all that much storage, and you would likely want to use a USB device at some point when you're on the go. All in all, we had to spend 5 hours of our time just to confirm that the manufacturer sent us a defective unit.We're not even going to try and wrestle with ASUS and their customer support this time around. We've had a number of ASUS products fail in recent times and have never once gotten them to accept any kind of responsibility. We have always been patient and polite with their customer support, but they seem adamant in not wanting to fix or replace their products.From our interactions with them, it was also clear that the agents weren't reading through our support tickets properly, often resulting in long, drawn out conversations where we would have to ask them the same question over again, so that they could notice days later and eventually conclude that they can't do anything to help.It does sting a bit that we are loyal ASUS customers, easily having spent thousands of dollars on their products over the years, and right now, having that count for nothing. We definitely cannot recommend buying their stuff if that's how they treat customers, especially when the problem is with their product to begin with.",0

"This computer is bought less than a year ago, and I have these ongoing issues:-Shuts down unexpectedly and won't turn on except for keyboard lights (once wouldn't turn on for an entire week)-Struggles to open and run basic applications like Chrome and iTunes-Poor performance in complex applications like Serato and Ableton (often crashes, glitches, high latency)-Audio driver almost incompatible with audio workstations.This computer works fine to run Microsoft office and web browser apps, but struggles to perform even at a basic level with anything more complicated.

"I have a Asus laptop that is 4 years old and runs windows 10. I have become so frustrated with windows updates. Constantly slowing the laptop down while it updates every time I use it. The other day it said that the windows 10 would no longer be supported soon, it also gave me an update that took 3 different attempts to load. 3 days of downloads, restarts and more downloads. I finally had enough. I researched the chromebook and decided to give it a try. Im not in school anymore so word processing is not a big deal, although Ive used google docs and like it. I don't game so thats not an issue. I do research online, email, shopping, news, weather etc. I am very impressed with the chromebook. It boots up in seconds, much faster than a windows machine. It is very snappy. I can open it up get me stuff done and move on without the windows problems. I've always had good luck with samsung phones, so hoping this will give me the same results",0
"Bought for my daughter for school. For a 11 year old just doing school work it’s great, if you were looking for a computer for everyday use and needing space and memory I wouldn’t suggest this.",0
"I bought this computer for my sister for Christmas and it actually performed better than what I expected. It's surprisingly fast and powerful for a laptop, plus it's build quality shows that. As for gaming, this thing absolutely owns it, with the ability to play literally any modern video game (I tested it with Overwatch and Destiny 2) at over 60fps at high graphics settings. This computer is great for power users, gamers and photo/video editors.",0
"I like it, though it could use a lot less ""Microsoft approved"" branding",0
"Un gran dise?o, muy ligera en su estructura, perfecta para video juegos de gama media con su procesador Ryzen y los integrados, una excelentes opción para aquellos que necesitan una computadora equilibrada para trabajo, estudios, juegos o simple ocio.",0
"The compatibility of this device with smartphones and tablets is a great convenience. It lets me access my files and applications from my mobile devices, making it a versatile addition to my tech ecosystem.",1
Arrived already open and missing a key. This is garbage.,0
Great for kids to do school or for adults to do basic things.,0
"The aluminum body is sleek, lightweight, and well built.",0
ok WARNING im only giving this a three star because well whats good is i love the keyboard and i love the screen and the cover is beautiful but why i only gave it a three star is because my chromebook came with a defect where i can only use it when its charging so say i at 100% if i unplug it it just dies right away ad the screen goes black but this shouldnt happen on all of them,0
"light weight and has most of the connections u need, screen colors are good",0
"Its an ok laptop if you had an extra 4gb stick of ram so that you at least have 8gb. Its not for gaming obviously. Its ok to the some office work, but that Windows S is just trash.",0
It was good for what you paid for. It was a lot smaller than I anticipated,0
"Great chromebook. Fast, efficient and great for a full size laptop",0
"The laptop just stopped working after 30 days, it won't stay on without being plugged in and the keyboard works when it feels like.",0
Got this for my 17 yr old son and he loves it he uses it just for online gaming definitely recommend for a first time gaming laptop,0
"The display appears washed out and ""soft"" looking. I never did figure out how to use Roadrunner IMAP mail with it. I was expecting something more like my android tablet with a keyboard. I returned it.",0
I like the browsing speed and 8 gigs for the price.Great picture for videos and occasional gaming. Overall very good laptop and a step up from the cheap ones still at an affordable price.,0
Great computer. Love the keyboard.,0
so much better than my 2013 MacBook Pro,0
"Honestly, this laptop is great. I got this for a really great price, and it was between this and the dell xps, so i bought this (kinda regretting that buts its a-okay). The first few months of using this were fantastic. Battery was relativel good, the display is crisp, and the build quality is superb. This all has one problem though- the fan. The fan is so loud, it's insane. It just randomly turns on when I do super light tasks, like watching netflix or just deleting files. It got to a point where I have to use headphones to drown out the sound. Not only is the fan loud, but it's also so inconsistent. I can be playing games like minecraft or destiny and it wont run the fan, but then when I do light tasks it roars like a jet. it's just too much.",0
This Laptop on the first charge got extremely hot and so did the keyboard. So I gave it a second chance on the second day and the same thing happened again. Needless to say I returned the laptop for a refund! The only good thing out of this was that UPS came and got it from my home. Saved on Gas!!!,0
"It's a mac. That's literally the only reason I bought it to customize an app that was iOS compatible only. Outside of that, the Camera is horrendous (its giving very 2011 photobooth camera quality) and if you have too many browsers or apps opens it practically crashes. Not really worth the prices in my opinion. Just pay the premium for a macbook pro if the camera and performance is a make or break for you.",0
I am just finding out about the touch screen but the laptop works great.,0
Got this as a gift during prime day sale. It came very promptly. I also live in an apartment complex and have a special kiosk system for packages. It's nice when I am out of town which I was when the package came. It came earlier than expected. I don't usually use the kiosk but they left it in there for me all securely. Laptop works great. The gift was a success as well! The only thing is that the camera could be better. My boyfriend needed a laptop due to his Lenovo shutting down and a nice camera (his old one stopped working) to confirm his identity for online tests. He tested it out and it was pretty blurry for a pricey laptop which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.,0
Buen desempeño por el precio. El ventilador hace un poco de ruido. El espacio del disco duro un poco limitado. Y no es adecuada para procesos de edición complejos. En general muy bien,0
Performance is so good for the price. This is probably one of the best offers -or the best one- out there,0
"Great laptop, much needed upgrade for me. Very fast with processing and running multiple programs.",0
RAS,0
A+++++,0
"Me gusta su dise?o y características, solo que ya van 2 días diferentes que al encenderla me sale esto , tengo que apagar la y esperar a que se reinicie otra vez.espero y lo deje de hacer",0
from the start up you can tell this is a powerful machine. Couldn't be happier,0
"Every thing works in Linux. When I got it I first tested on Linux live OS and checked all the drivers. Then after testing for a week I decided to commit to it. First I wiped the Windows OS which I never use and made the Linux OS perminant. Then I properly assembled the unit with proper thermal paste on processor and added thermal tapes on other components. Now I get 16 hours on Linux while my laptop always stays cool, quiet and stable. I charge my laptop once every 3 days or 4. Excellent laptop but you have to fix it once it comes messed up. I had to do the same to XPS 15",0
Bought this laptop 6 month ago. Very happy with it. We use it for business. So far so good!,0
"Voy a ser lo más preciso y honesto posible. Compre esta laptop el 24 de enero de 2018 y aun posee un excelente rendimiento, obiamente la duración de la bateria ya no es de casi 5 horas como al principio pero aun asi se mantiene en casi 4 horas dependiendo el ipo de tareas que este realizando.Si estas buscando una laptop para tareas y jugar esta es la tuya.",0
"Well worth it, great price.",0
"Buen producto, entrega oportuna.",0
The Chromebook came with absolutely NO OPERATING MANUAL OR INSTRUCTION BOOK and I still cannot get it to operate.,0
"I thought I got a great deal as I purchased this through treasure truck. But like many of the other reviews stated, there is constantly issues with the WiFi. Every time I close the lid and the computer goes to sleep, the next time I boot it up, WiFi cannot be located. Long story short…..I returned the damn thing.",0
Tried to charge over 2 days. Never charged over 34%. Not impressed. Returning this eeek. Will keep shopping for laptop.,0
"I was looking for something ultra portable for Browsing, ebook reading, and general use..Just as described.I added a 128Gb microSD card (mounted) on C drive for permanent storage...Switched off Win 10 s > win 10 home..Had to update before I was able to switch off S mode..Loving it so far!..Thanks Amazon for fast service as always..",0
"This is my first laptop and I’m real happy with the purchase. The speakers on this are nice and loud I love it. The size is a great size, not too big and definitely not too small, it’s just right. The screen is great too love the picture quality and it gets brights. I’m not super in tune with all the laptop lingo and things that matter but as a person who just bought their first laptop, definitely worth it.",0
The laptop also gets incredibly hot and loud when gaming at high settings,0
"At first I was really happy to get a “nice” laptop that I could play games and do work on it. But I want to let other people know that it’s not that could consider getting something else.1. First problem i encountered was randomly it didn’t want to charge maybe I assumed it was bc it was too hot so i gave it time to cool down then it still didn’t want to charge luckily there was a video I had found.2. it’s very uncomfortable to lay down and play or even watch it will leave an imprint or even be way too hot to put onto legs, I used to pillow or blanket because it was that hot.3. now all of a sudden my laptop screen is frozen for whatever reason4. The battery life is Not good at all! 7 hours is not true maybe 3 hours of playing games but not 7. Maybe if I were just watching movies and looking up stuff but if this is what it’s supposed to be a Gaming Laptop then it’s not 7 and the only game I play is the Sims .But the only thing I like that is why I’m giving the stars I am is the screen quality it is very good I play Sims in high resolution.",0
Was a great gift,0
"The laptop was good while it lasted (which was 5 months). Had to send it back because it wouldn't turn on, even after attempting to reset the battery. 2/5",0
The keyboard is so horrible and it is non replaceable anytime I type a paragraph at least a few words have missing letters because the key board doesn’t pick up the letter,0
"After a lot of research of other laptops, this one seemed to fit my needs which were basically light weight, fast, adequate memory and the right size for me. This fits the bill. I use it for accessing my other laptop by remote server so that I can work wherever a connection is available and also searching on this one for genealogy purposes. Delivery was as promised and I am happy with it. Would recommend it.",0
"Playing games, the graphics processor pretty much screams.",0
"Have used this in many hotels to find restaurants and points of interest. Light weight, easy to pack and use. Very helpful.",0
"La probe viendo oeliculas en linea y se calienta mucho y se detiene. Tiene parpadeos en la pantalla. El cargador es como lava, super caliente a pesar de que son 200w. Si pudiese devolverla lo haria. Muy mala inversión. La bateria no dura ni 2 horas. Esta laptop es una hornilla con luces bonitas.",0
"Literally started my business from this computer, Not a heavily tech based/needed business but I absolutely love it. Went through 2 basic cheap $200-$300 laptops through and after college before this and wish I would have started here originally. Speed is great, battery life feels infinite at this point, and the touch screen is more accurate and more convenient than I thought it would be. The one and only draw back is not having a ""finger-friendly numerical input"" (phone digit 1-9 on the right side) but I'm sure that's due more to the size I purchased rather than the overall design. About 6 months in and I have yet to come upon a problem, and if so I'm sure Dell would take care of me. Definitely recommend to anyone in any situation.",0
El producto llegó tal como señala en la descripción. Diseño elegante y Super liviano. Excelente laptop. Aunque a veces se tarda en iniciar cuando la prendo. Es la única observación. Lo demás me gustó.,0
"If you can afford it, this is a great computer",0
"Purchased the Nitro 5 in May 2021... And have noticed while gaming, that it runs at or above 95C with a cooling pad... Even with the fans cranked to the Max in NitroSense!!! 95C is way to hot, and not normal!!! Running at 95C would no doubt had lead to premature failure of the CPU and GPU!!!This is a well known fact, yet unaddressed issue of the ACER Nitro and it is well noted and documented in Acer forums as well as YouTube and other sources, including reviews on this page... With that being said, I purchased Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut and cleaned off the existing OEM applied thermal paste, and applied the Kryonaut on the CPU and GPU as well as a little on the CPU/GPU cooler...(A DIY video is available on youtube) I then also changed the power plan in NitroSense to Power Saver... To my amazement, I am now gaming stable at 60C and under normal work loads I average about 40C to 45C...Hope this helps",0
"Llegó antes de la fecha indicada, muy buen equipo excepto que no tiene una luz que indique que tiene el Mayus activo pero en general todo bien.",0
"If you can handle replacing the battery every 6 months you should be fine. However I do want to remind people that this laptop is not to get attached too, if it has issues I highly recommend you buy a flash drive to put everything on if you plan on buying something else. No the touch screen does not work.I have looked at the other reviews and have not experienced any issues other than the battery needing replacement. If I do have them then I will make another review.",0
The screen has poor quality,0
Excellent product. Bought for my son to use for school and games and have had no issues or concerns.,0
"If your looking to game on the go and not spend a fortune this is a good choice.This is a budget machine, it uses AMD chipset and a 4g of VRAM. So it is not top of the line but for most games it just fine. As a bonus it is RTX enabled though you won't squeek out every last pixel of amazement like some higher end models.For most games it is plenty. Minecraft, Genshin Impact at Max settings. Roblox, most of the stuff off Steam.Graphics card aside its got a bright, very saturated screen. Not something you would want to use for photo processing but the games sure look good.Its got good connectivity with USB ports, HDMI out, headphone jack, USB C, Camera (with a turn the camera off switch). It doesn't have a fingerprint reader or SD card slot.On board sound is good, though the speakers are on the bottom of the unit, so that can muffle things a bit.General speed and responsiveness of launching applications, switching things around is good, on par, maybe a tad slower than some other I7 laptops I've used.Whose this for? Someone who wants to game and doesn't want to spend a fortune. You get a decent experience for a good price.",0
"I bought this to take on the road and connect to Bluetooth so I could use my iPhone as a hot spot. No such luck. It connects for a few seconds then disconnects. The whole reason I bought it and it don't work. From searching, this apparently is an known issue with Chrombooks and has been for a while yet Google won't fix it.Never had these problems with a Windows laptop.",0
"FFF (fast, fantastic, fun), looks great visually and physically. Going back I probal would have bought their high end model instead, but still we’ll worth the money as is.",0
the coil whining got so heavy that it's almost impossible to work with the device in a quite office spac,0
"I bought this as a travel computer and it is perfect. Ultra light weight but with everything I need for mail, Internet, games, and writing. I love it.",0
"I like the computer is cool and very fast, configuration is easy and fast the keyboard is smooth and colorfull! The software takes optimization to the next level with an adjustable system.I highly recommend it, I absolutely love it!!",0
"Bought this for my husband and he loved it, he wanted a light, fast laptop that he can use for his business and he absolutely loved it. Im glad i purchased this laptop",0
"The laptop does heat up very quickly when playing games, and the fans can be loud",0
"Great laptop for those on a budget, gets good/consistent fps for most modern day games. Great cooling and UI. Battery life is around and hr for heavy gaming and about an HR and a half for moderate gaming. Great screen quality.",0
This computer is well worth the money you pay period,0
"Shortly after purchasing the machine, the power button would fail to turn on the computer. Disappointing, however, the Dell support did well by us. After troubleshooting over the phone, they sent a tech to replace the motherboard. We have not experienced issues with the power button since.Overall, this is a very nice machine and I would buy it again if and when it goes on sale.",0
i would of given it a 5 star but i have never used a chromebook before soo its a little confusing and harder to get used to is all.,0
Me encantó la laptop,0
"J'aime beaucoup le portable. La grosseur et le look.L'utilisation du pad est très fluide et glisse particulièrement bien comparativement à tous les autres pad que j'ai utilisé.Les performances sont très intéressantes.Le clavier numérique me manque comparativement à d'autre portable.Le seul point négatif c'est qu'il a toujours l'air sale à cause qu'il est noir. Donc, dès que nous y touchons, des empreintes de doigts ou de main apparaissent.",0
A simple machine with simple goals. Set up and use is easy.I like it.,0
"It worked out good for my daughter. She’s happy with it, so there you have it.",0
I was unable to adjust the backlighting on the SteelSeries keyboard before updating the SteelSeries Engine 3 software several times,0
"i wanted to use this laptop for watching things such as netflix and youtube, but every time i do that, it crashes. a screen pops up saying "" Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage."" It happens repeatedly and its very annoying. im hoping to return this laptop soon :(((",0
"This Chromebook looks great, speaker and screen are very nice. We are using it foroffice work and it suits are needs fine. Good price for the product.",0
"This laptop is to replace an older model. Simple setup, lightweight without feeling flimsy and pretty to look at. Its fast, has a long lasting battery and does what I need it to do.",0
Husband loves it! Very light weight and small.,0
Soooooo slow,0
THE CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS ARE SERIOUSLY LACKING!.,0
"You can't beat the styling, battery life and performance for the price.I got this while I was learning how to program for school.I've been doing some photoshop(GIMP) with it as well as Blender and haven't had a problem. I play HoTS and Hearthstone on it all the time, and some Minecraft(playing Project ozone Lite right now with my wife).Has trouble running WoW but plays most games I throw at it just fine, Don't Starve and Factorio etc.Only down side is that I wished it had more ram.I'm learning Unity3D right now and the 8gb is kind of the bottleneck.",0
Screen quality is exceptional.,0
This laptop is really good and it super fast and for the price of it it get the job done is I highly recommended it.,0
Purchased for my daughter as her prior machine was dead. She loves this computer.,0
"This has been a great laptop for online school! Great price, arrived quickly!",0
Lightweight keyboard is a bit larger so nice for kids,0
Laptop does not have a Caps Lock Key or any of the function keys. It small enough for use at school for taking notes but not much else.,0
Switched to chromebooks a few years back. Great battery life and great speeds. No worries about security problems.,0
"I really am enjoying this laptop so far. The high power limited 3070ti plays all the games I enjoy at 100-140 fps and the screen looks quite good. The speakers are the best I've heard on a gaming laptop so far (although i wish they could be a bit louder.) I upgraded mine from 16 gigs of ram to 32 and the process was pretty close to simple- since there are two ribbon cables connecting to the LED light bar you should be careful of.The keyboard feels good and the touchbar isn't anything specia but isn't a pain to use. Temps weren't amazing, but not super bad either in my experience so far. With a cooling pad under it, and gaming for about 3 hours the gpu hit a max of 81c and the cpu averaged maybe 70-85 depending on the core- with a few spiking to 99c for a few seconds. Idle temps are super good. When doing very light things I rarely ever even notice fan noise and even while gaming its not enough to force you to wear headphones to block the sound out.The only downsides I can think of are the limited BIOS customization options and lack of webcam. Those two things aside, this laptop is a beast and I am super happy that I got mine for a good price",0
"I use this laptop for gaming and light browsing, wonderful laptop for the money. The fans aren't nearly as loud as people state, yes they are noticeable but not overwhelming and with headphones you don't hear them. I under volted and dropped power for CPU to 99% to help with thermals. It hasn't got anywhere near dangerous temps without under volting but doing so raised my score in cinebench and dropped the temps quite a bit.",0
Only think I like better on my older Lenovo is that the caps lock and number lock keys light up. I have had an occasional problem with the number pad not working even with lock on in this Sager but otherwise I am pleased with the laptop. I have actually not had time to try it out in a game yet. I have not found anything wrong with it unlike a Dell I bought and immediately returned. This is my 2nd sager and the older one still works great just is outdated. Sager and Lenovo are the only brands that work good for me right out of the box.,0
"The battery life is very poor and an upgraded battery and additional RAM upgrade is more than buying a better laptop to begin with. I am not a gamer, however I do use photo editing and drawing tablets, and the battery gets drained in one hour or less. I also run DirectRip (for textile printing) and need to use the laptop plugged in at all times.The build quality is great and I like the keyboard. It isn't bad for the price, if you are not using it for gaming or needing to use unplugged for long.",0
"I have two kids with autism. My son burns thru laptops like crazy. I needed a simple laptop that was easy to set up, easy to use and had just the basics. This was it. I don't have to deal with him deleting programs, clicking on settings or doing who knows what to it. It works perfectly for him, he can type his little lists, read about all the disney movies and actors, play his candy crush and I can be happy about the price. Battery life is good, Price is great, Arrived fast, in perfect condition and was easy to set up. He loves it.",0
I'm not an expert typist and would like to be able to see the keyboard better when it is light out.The mouse pad is so sensitive I often wind up in places I never intended to be.,0
"It's perfect for someone like me who doesn't need a big, fancy setup. The screen quality is fantastic for the price.",0
"This laptop is amazing! Fast, intuitive and so much more! Great for school, work and gaming. No lags and I live the fingerprint log in. The seller is excellent service. So glad to not have a bad laptop experience like I did with another seller. Exceptional product, I am buying another die my daughter! Thank you!",0
"I had a heck of a time when using this because of the wifi dropping out or not initializing. I believe that the ""bloatware"" was interfering with it. I say this because I updated windows several times to no avail. It does work fine now. The swiching of the wifi driver to disable letting windows decide when to optimize battery usage DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. The battery does charge quickly but it does not last super long (may explain in part the quick charging). I am now completely satisfied.",0
"Its an HP and another one that the fans are not working and it is getting hot. The vents are on the bottom of the computer, therefore no where to breath. I just bought a fan cooler Kyolly cooling pad to go with it and it is doing the job. I also have an extended warranty on this computer because I had an HP in the past with a cooling problem. I will not be returning it and not talking to the company because the external fans are doing the job. Sometimes you can get a download to make internal fans work but not sure if that is the problem.As for the computer functions it is fast starts up fast and I like it. The only thing I did not like is it automatically changed all my documents from my old computer to my new. So keep that in mind when you purchase your new computer for memory purposes. Also one drive is still full and that is one reason I purchased a new one. So I will have to get a different cloud source.",0
"Es hermosaTiene teclado retroiluminado, creo que el material es meta o aluminio, la verdad no estoy segura pero se siente de excelente calidad. Solo la he usado hoy que me llegó y va muy bien, es rápida ???Aquí en México casi no hay variedad de laptops, entonces es buena idea comprar en Amazon por importancion, el teclado viene en inglés pero lo puedes configurar para que tenga la repartición como en México.Buenas compra ?",0
"Me gusta su peso y velocidad, claro de momento está nueva esperemos en un tiempo siga igual.",0
Most games look like irl and have a very great frame rate speed. Not all game need turbo or extreme mode to run flawlessly which is nice.,0
The windows 10 runs fast.,0
"Before Christmas I asked my son if he cared whether his gaming laptop was an official Alienware computer, or not. He said not in the least. This one was less expensive, but had basically the same specs. He loves it! The big feature he was after was the equivalent graphics card, but this one also had twice the RAM. I'm a very happy camper and more importantly my son is, too.",0
The lights behind the keyboard is pretty cool too . . . easy to customize the look.,0
My granddaughters love their new chrome books!,0
It would not charge-went totally dead in a short period and other than being a paperweight it is totally worthless!!!!!!!,0
"Cooling has been terrific, I'm running a -128 undervolt on cache and core and keeping a very staple 3.9ghz on all cores pegging out at mid 80c on cpu.",0
I use this as a tower stand in. The chassis feels cheaply made compared to my last MSI laptop. Over all performance is 8/10. Not bad but nothing really stands out.A good deal for the price. Some hot spots on the screen but they're hardly noticeable while in use.Over all 7/10,0
Bought for my youngest and she loves it. Great little machine for Internet users.,0
"I purchased this to replace a 9 year old laptop. I had it less than a week when I noticed the back getting hot. Really hot. We used a forehead thermometer to read how hot it was & the thermometer could not read it because it was too high. I could not keep my hand on the back of the computer because it was too hot. It took more than 2.5 hours for the temperature to drop.Thankfully, the Amazon Customer Service team was AMAZING. I spoke to a representative & a replacement was ordered in less than 20 minutes. They also sent clear instructions for returning the laptop.I am hoping that this is just a one off issue & it doesn't repeat. I will come back with an update.",0
"instaled win 11 , i think its to erlie to use it yet -still have bugsbattery lower then , other thinks is goodnice pc",0
The screen is bright(!) with sharp resolution,0
Powerful laptop that can handle music production and djing softwares without problems. This computer is so light and thin that it is unbelievable how well it works.There is no need to buy a Macbook Pro M1. Shop this one without hesitation.,0
This is my fourth Acer. Had this laptop for 32 days. The laptop got really hot and I could not get it o cool down. I called the Amazon repair center and was told it was no longer under warranty. Was transferred several times. Was sent finally to Acer service. They told me since it may be a fire issue I would have to send it back for repair and be without a laptop for 5 to 10 business days. I do not have other options. I am running two households due to the fact that my Mother in law is in Memory care. They said they would send me a mailing label. I would have to package it up and take it to a Fed ex store at my expense. Terrible customer service.,0
i used this chromebook just for basic stuff such as social networks and video streaming. it wasnt a bad option for the price at first but beware. after a year of usage the screens starts having major problems and the chromebook itself stops working several times a week. i would skip this product and go for something a bit better.,0
"One of the keys popped off during normal usage and when I tried to place it back I ended up bending the little tabs on the bottom not knowing how delicate they were. Contacted Acer and was told they do not sell any replacement keys which I find to be absolutely ridiculous considering how delicate they are, and that's more than enough to steer me away from this company for good.",0
"Battery life is poor, as to be expected from a laptop of this nature",0
"I've been meaning to upgrade my computer for a couple of years because I use programs like AutoCAD and Photoshop for designing. I'm not an industrial designer or architect so I don't do serious 3D renderings and drafting, but I do work in 3D intermittently and do extensive 2D drafting and graphics. So far, after about having it for a month with my essential programs installed, this laptop boots in less than 15 seconds when you power it on. AutoCAD and Photoshop also boots quickly - about 10 to 15 seconds it's ready to go.Color on screen is great too. Keyboard is not as quiet as I'd like it to be, but it's totally acceptable (I think).Battery power is great too - to me, being able to work in my graphic stuff without plugging in my laptop for three-four hours is miracle.Bit weighty - the power adapter is pretty big too (somebody compared it to a stack of three iPhone X's and that's a pretty good description of it.)I'm not an expert on sound quality, but I'm pretty happy with it for listening to music and video.I DO experience the wireless getting glitchy sometimes - I'd be at home working and then suddenly it will disconnect itself from my WiFi, but then quickly reconnects itself. Not sure if it's the computer or my home network though - I mostly work from home so not sure if it will do the same thing elsewhere. So far so good!",0

"I was looking for a gaming laptop under 1,000$ with powerful GPU, there were lot of options out there, but everyone has its own cons which held me from buying it, the options I have been Lenovo Y520, Asus 553, Dell 7567, Acer Predator Helios 300 and MSI GL62MY520 had a horrible keyboard and numpad even though its screen was great, Dell was heavy as a piano, Helios was an amazing option especially on the black Friday, it dropped from 1,050$ to 900$ yet I passed it. and then came to the GL62M and purchased with a great offer of 800$ from Amazon (but from my brother's account) that's why I'm not seen as a verified purchase.Anyway, coming to the pros and cons, What I like about the GL62M:- Lightweight comparing to others from the same category- The keyboard is noiseless- The laptop runs cool and quiet, except while gaming It would become a chopper but that's fine with me- Powerful GPU 1050TI, CPU I7-7700 which makes gaming experience so amazing, played COD WW2 and Shadow of war both on High details FHD- It came with 1TB HDD, and Samsung 128GB SSD reaching 2700MB/s reading speed and 520 Writing speed- Came with English version of windows not as many people complained about getting a Chinese version, boots up in 13 secsWhat I didn't like about it:- The windows key is on the right side of the space which is weird and sometimes frustrating during my office work (Win+D) along with Del, home and end keys being in an abnormal place, other than that its good keyboard- Screen: the TN screen is not quite the deal for gaming, its fine with office work and browsing, but when it comes to gaming, it will be a bit of a disappointment.- Speakers: I'm not going to say they are fine, unfortunately, they are not, I didn't imagine that my 3 years old Lenovo Y510 would sound way much better than this laptop, I laughed when I heard the speakers because I thought it was a joke, yet most people use headphones for gaming or music, that's why I didn't take out a star at this point, and I'm using a Bluetooth JBL speaker during gaming.- Battery life: it lasts for 2.5 - 3 hours of office work and browsing in the best situation.Generally speaking, I'm loving this laptop even with the previously mentioned disadvantages especially (screen, speakers)This is the first laptop I use from MSI in my life, I am a Lenovo fan but it really worth the go, even with the current price of 900$ it really worth it, if you can ignore the screen and the speakers.Finally, I like this laptop and I am planning to keep it for the next 2 years.",0
Muy buena maquina. Se escucha muy bajo el alta voz.,0
"laptop looks great and functions greatly, looks quite slick as well",0
"too slow , even on browsing , try multiple reboot still same. better decided to return .. never buy refurbished. stay away from this item",0
"very light and powerful machine, ideal for design, gaming, etc.",0
"500GB hd inadequate. Needed turbo mode to do VR, it's just enough, but not enough to play games. Over priced at the time I bought it for what it's made of. Ot enough memory, storage or processing. It's an easy pass, but heck it's been almost 2 years,, it wasn't enough then, so why make the review? Moore's law..should have been good enough..bottom line it's just Amazon's skewed ratings",0
screen size is just perfect not too big not too small.,0
Excellent laptop. Beast for the price,0
"Ive had this laptop for 3-4 months and unfortunately it developed some issues where it would get blue screen crashes, and freeze for long periods after starting up.As you can tell by the title, I received some great customer service. It was almost free for me to send them the laptop, and it was returned with recorded delivery ages before I expected it would be done.Ive also had a few questions about the laptop since I bought it and Ive always received great help from them - which is very important!So why only 4-stars?The main reason is that if you like to clean the fans, it's not as easy as taking the back off the laptop and then taking out the screws where the fans are. I haven't worked up to it yet but it looks like there's a whole thermal system I need to take out before I can remove the fans to clean, which is a little daunting as I worry I will break something :DBasically it's not easy enough for the regular consumer to handle themselves.The fans can also get pretty noisy and the laptop can get pretty hot when using it on fairly demanding games (this is even with the laptop being on a stand). I was a little worried that the hardware will wear out quickly but I've been told it's OK.If it was just the noisy fans and heat I would probably give it 5 stars, but the extra difficulty of cleaning the fans was the clincher for me.Maybe Im being unfair? I don't know what goes into the design of a laptop, but if it's possible to make cleaning the fans as simple as taking the back off the laptop and unscrewing the fan screws, it makes a big difference to me personally.",0
It stays pretty cool and quiet even in its loudest mode called turbo.,0
Not to bad for a cheaper computer. If you wanna spend a couple hundred for a laptop this is deffanently worth it. Side note Idk who delivers you packages but the girl who delivered it threw it 5ft to land on my porch. If that's not bad enough I have a note asking to please place package between screen door. I saw he chuck when I looked out my front window because I heard a car pull up,0
"Lightweight, great battery, used it for school work, I would buy again",0
This computer does everything we need it to do.,0

"I just got this computer delivered recently, and while I do enjoy the weight, build material, keyboard, and screen, there are some significant drawbacks.First, the sound. The sound quality on this laptop is HORRIBLE. Very tin-y and cheap, like a ten dollar bluetooth speaker. Because of this, the volume is either too low and difficult to hear, or too high and grating to listen to.Second, the battery. If you want portability, DO NOT get this laptop. I realize that as a gaming laptop, the battery life is not long. But just using my internet browser, the laptop went from 94% to 17% in ten minutes. Again, I was only running the internet.Last, the lag. There seems to be significant slowdown on video playback of any kind, and programs will lock up seemingly at random. I haven't yet installed any games or large programs to run. I've noticed these issues running an internet browser for Facebook, Youtube, and Twitch. My confidence in actually being able to game on this is shaken, but I will report back when I try it.",0
"I switched over to this HP Victus gaming laptop around two months ago. Based on the build quality (it's sleek and feels great to type on even though no mechanical keyboard), its performance when gaming (mostly MMOs or FPS games), and how it handles multitasking (I run a BlueIris VMS server on it most of the day with about 7 PoE cameras recording through it), I can comfortably recommend it.The Victus handles Elden Ring on med-high graphics settings averaging 65-80 FPS, Fortnite at over 100FPS on high graphics settings, Halo infinite at 50-58 FPS on high settings, and various other AAA games at 60+ FPS @ 1080p on high graphics settings. If you turn the graphics settings down to low or medium-low you can max out the FPS (144hz for this panel) on older games like Fortnite or Dota 2. I was able to max out World of Warcraft TBC Classic as well on medium and low settings. This laptop has no trouble with large raids in WoW Classic or large battles in Halo Infinite on medium settings.I don't really notice any bottlenecks when I'm using it besides when I'm gaming and forget to change the recording settings of my PoE cams in BlueIris. You can complete most productivity oriented tasks with this laptop such as data analysis with 20,000+ row excel files, editing videos while completing coursework, and more. This would be a good dev laptop as well even though the specs aren't super overpowered.The HP Omen button on the keyboard opens up the HP Omen Gaming hub which lets you configure different profiles for optimizing performance while gaming or battery life while using the laptop for normal tasks. I kind of wish it had a dedicated overclock button like other gaming laptops but it's easy enough to toggle the mode to performance and max out the fan using the HP Omen Gaming Hub.The keyboard feels satisfying to type on. It has a full numpad as well. The chassis feels pretty solid. I like the smooth finish on the top of the laptop. The speakers are actually excellent. I like the tuning and enjoy listening to music from them even though I have my larger bookshelf speakers right behind my laptop and triple monitors. They did a good job with the user experience.Thankfully this is a semi-repairable laptop as well. You can easily open up the bottom of the chassis and add/remove/upgrade the ram, replace the battery after a few years, or nvme SSD. The ports included are generous and allow for easily outputting to two extra monitors though you will need a usb-c to hdmi converter. It would've been nice if it had thunderbolt as well but it still works well as is and thankfully has an ethernet port.I've included some benchmarks here as well. For me it's a great gaming laptop, I'd say a 4.5/5, not quite perfect but good enough for my needs. The laptop feels fairly premium which makes me have confidence in its long-term durability even though it has a fair bit of plastic.",0
"Es, a mi parecer, la mejor laptop que se puede comprar a ese precio, según crucial se puede ampliar la RAM a 32G lo que la volverá un monstruo!",0
Awesome product thank you,0
"All good, except charging cable was broken,but I got some support from Amazon team.",0
I don't love that it's centered on the machine,0
"Didn't notice that it wasn't a touchscreen. Returned it. Actually said in the details ""non touchscreen"" so when I searched for touchscreen Chromebook, it came up in the results.",0
the laptop heats up with minimal effort. The processor stops constantly and the sound came defective.,0
"Just had it for a day.Its not too heavyChrome and apps run fastBattery seems pretty good at the start.I like it as I generally use Google aps, documents, calender. Great for the android world.Will see how it goes over time .",0
This is the best laptop I have ever owned. Everything works as advertised. I had not realized it came with the finger print reader. My previous experience with one was a failure. This one works flawlessly. I have switched out the 120gb SSD for a 480gb SSD and added a 8gb stick of memory (12gb total). The extra bright screen is a joy to use. Overall the laptop is blazingly fast. At least to me. It is a joy to use and the price was right also.,0
Great producr,0
"Bought this for my kid but laptop arrived dead on arrival and we returned it. He bought a laptop directly from Dell instead, works like a charm.",0
"Pros: For the money, it has great performance. It runs applications fast and can do basic audio and photo editing much quicker than my last computer. The keyboard is nice and backlit, and it is light, thin, and easy to throw into a backpack. Battery life is great (maybe 8hrs on average?) and it charges very quickly, even while in use.Cons: It has some annoying technical issues. The trackpad is a little flimsy, and will sometimes decide it doesn't want to autoscroll. Also the screen sometimes just decides to darken a little even while plugged in, and in general even the highest brightness setting is not that great. The screen also doesn't open too wide (maybe 110°)",0
Great ! Love it,0
"With my kids' using Google classroom at school, this is an affordable Chromebook that allows them to do their work as well as navigate You Tube and Netflix...and all the other things that they use!",0
"I bought this computer thinking it was new. Nowhere did it say it was used or refurbished. However, when opening the packaging it had a notice saying it was a refurbished unit. Confused, I went back to look at the order. There is still nothing on this page that says it is refurbished. The only place that said it was used was on the order details. Now the site (two days after ordering it) is showing the same computer for $70 less than what I paid (I'm assuming this was the refurbished price). So I paid the new price and got a refurbished unit. I'm not against buying a refurbished unit, I'm upset that I paid a higher amount thinking I was getting a new computer. The vendor needs to clearly state on the page that it is a refurbished unit, and charge you the refurbished price. Not happy with this purchase.",0
"I bought this laptop for my wife for basic needs. She loves the size and weight of the laptop. It performs well so far, no issues.",0
Great for my high school student,0
"This laptop listed as (10SCXK-211) may appear to be a good deal and ultimately it is still a decent laptop but the specs are not accurate. The listing name and description state 2 different GPUs as 1650 Ti and then as 1660 Ti of which it is neither of these. It is actually a standard mobile 1650 NON-Ti. Now this doesn't make the biggest of differences but it is a step down in performance of what is the most expensive component in the machine (GPU in 2021).And now the biggest letdown; it is listed in the title and in the description that the laptop has a 144hz 1080p Display, but it is actually just a cheap 60hz panel with terrible viewing angles and minimal brightness, and yes I made sure it wasn't a driver or settings issue before I realized even the sticker on the box listing the specs does not mention 144hz. This feature adds the biggest value to a ""gaming"" laptop after the GPU.Now these things considered it is still a decent laptop and I have other uses for it so I went ahead and ordered another better gaming laptop from Amazon and reached out to amazon support about also keeping this one if they could compensate me for the specs being misrepresented and at least correct the specs on the Amazon listing. They originally offered a $10 discount but then offered $15 which I reluctantly accepted since I didn't want to have to send it back and I had already spent hours setting it up and updating it and then trying to figure out why I couldn't get the 144hz to work and decided I would just gift it to a family member. Amazon should understand the difference in value of these misstated specs and offer more than $15 for the difference, although I did have the option to send it back instead.So everyone just be warned that they still haven't changed the specs on the page and description. There is very little info to be found online of this particular model # in the listing but the actual specs are closer to MSI Model #: 10SCXK-066 which you can find info on from MSI website and the only difference between that 066 and this one is that the 066 has an extra 1TB HDD.For any prospective buyers considering this laptop, I suggest keep looking for a better deal.",0
"HP laptops have the battery built in now so you cannot remove it in case of emergency. My laptop died with the same error on hard drive. Even with HP care pack warranty HP would not repair it, but The care pack says it covers such? Im never buying another HP computer 👨‍💻 👎",0

"This laptop is sleek, light and nifty. But has serious flaws.- The biggest one being that it simply refuses to wake up from sleep mode. I've tried various workarounds from the web but no success- The battery life is also not as long as advertised. Barely makes it to an hour fully charged- Its noisy. The fan runs constantly- Audio isn't great. And fan noise just makes it worseRegret buying this one. I would recommend you pay the extra bucks and go for the other much better brands out there.",0
"Very good gaming laptop! Can run any game at 144 FPS or more (with minor graphics adjusting). There is also little to none input delay, so good for competitive gaming. The fans keep the laptop pretty cool. Download times are very fast. The only three bad things are: 1. Short battery life (which is inevitable in all gaming laptops) 2. Bad color blending (which is supposed to make it easier to spot targets in FPS games, but there should be different modes) 3. The sound from the internal speakers are pretty bad (and drowned out if the fans are loud), but I always use a headset anyways.",0
It turns on almost instantly thanks to the SSD and I have yet to find a single stutter as I power my way through massive photoshop and Illustrator files.,0
"I use this laptop to browse the web, use Microsoft applications and access my office computer through Citrix. The screen feels huge compared to my old ultraportable, which had a 13"" screen. This one has a 17"" but feels even lighter! I can easily use one hand to move it off my lap to another surface. The keyboard is a little flatter than I'm used to, and there is more real estate devoted to the track pad than I think is necessary, so I feel like I am reaching over it to get to the keyboard. I also wish there were full-sized PgUp/Dn and Home/End keys, instead of these half-sized ones that I need to use with the Function key. Those minor complaints aside, I am blown away. Unlike my old Lenovo, this computer starts up quickly, connects to the internet quickly, seems to work great, and again, has that huge screen despite being very lightweight. It actually fits in the case I bought for my old 13"" laptop (although barely); because the bevel around the screen is so slim, it's not as much bigger/wider as you'd think for the much larger screen. It and my slim case fit in the rolling bag that I travel with, which is a smaller one designed to fit under most seats and avoid the dreaded ""you have to check that"" instruction from the flight attendants. Because gamers are a big part of the market for high end laptops these days, reviews focus on the lack of a GPU. I haven't noticed an issue for any of my uses. Also, I haven't used it on battery power often, but when I did I found that the battery seemed to last quite a bit longer than previous laptops. I can't say whether the reported time is accurate, but it definitely seems to have a long-lasting battery.Update: the half-sized PgUp/Dn keys drive me nuts. But the fingerprint reader makes logging on fast and easy. Also, I've started using the built-in microphone with Dragon NaturallySpeaking (both locally and through Citrix) and the built-in microphone is surprisingly good. Not as good as a top-rated microphone, but accurate enough that it doesn't feel worth setting up or attaching an external microphone or headset. Using the built-in microphone is so convenient when I'm not at my desk!",0
I love this computer! It was the easiest set up I have ever seen. I did it myself without help from my normal technical support guru!,0
"Gave this to our son for Christmas. He loves it. It is perfect for his college courses, work and fun.",0
"Its slow, colors contrast is terrible and if you click on a story and in it is a sidebar, click on that and its impossible to read as the scroll feature is uncontrollable and the drop down ads take forever to download. in some situations the scrol down feature disappears entirely.",0
"I've had this laptop for about a month now and I don't want to jump into conclusions, but for what you pay, you get one of the best laptops in my opinion.With the GTX 1050, 16GB ram, 256 SSD(and 1T HDD) and the i7 you get THE smooth experience. Very good with multitasking and a good 14hrs of work, gaming, editing, etc with only medium range heating in the middle of the keyboard - the cooling system works great and practically I don't feel the heat with the way I place my hands on the keyboard (which is the usual left and right side of it).The display doesn't have the best viewing angles, but I bought it fully aware it is a TN display so I can't say I'm disappointed. As a person who uses it 80% of the time on a desk/table, I can say the display is decent - nice contrast and it is Full HD so that's nice.I read somewhere that the battery life is bad but I did travel 6 and a half hours with pre-downloaded episodes on Netflix, battery saving mode on and it only shut about 10 minutes before I arrived to my destination. So I can't agree with it. And I've played Overwatch (by the way the stats there are amazing) for about 3 hours without a charger, on ultra settings, and it ran smoothly.The only issue I recall is the plastic part that's holding the display - it was kind of ""unclicked"", if you get what I mean - it looked like it wasn't clicked properly to where it's supposed to be, so i pressed it firmly and it clicked right into place, it was a bit disappointing as overall the built quality is very good. The laptop has a very nice feel to it as it's aluminium and you need to push with a lot of pressure in order to have the keyboard or lid budge.Overall a great laptop. Has the stats of a gaming laptop, looks amazing and has a reasonable price.",0
Awesome laptop but the battery life is very i mean very bad doesnt even last me 1 hour and while i game is like less than 30 minutes or even when am making music on FL studio jesus. Overall good laptop just that the battery is bad as they say or else i would give 5 stars.,0
This is just such a great laptop. It is perfection in every way. I did order mine with 512 of storage and 16 GB's of memory. Air is a great name for it because using it is like moving through air...effortless...a real joy.,0
Too bad,0
Mild coil whine but it's usually just when it's on Gaming/creator mode.,0
amazing! The only downside is that it's hard to find a keyboard case for this.,0
I have been using Mac for a decade. The new job requested to have a M.S. hence I bought this one from Amazon. Nice one. The only thing is that I have chosen it 15” and this is the first lab top i get it that big which looks a bet weird. But it seems very handy and light. There is no light to show the cap lock is on or off. May be just because I am used to the Mac. The speed and the performance looks satisfactory but it has been only few days with me. Wish it will last.,0
I bought this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. Very light weight and user friendly. She loves it!,0

Starting the PC up and getting running only takes seconds.,0
Within a few minutes of starting a game the laptop freezes and has to be manually restarted. Happens multiple times before I can actually play a game.I'm still searching for a solution.,0
"Performance-wise, the laptop is outstanding. I've not had a problem with anything I've thrown at it thus far, be it downloading, moving files around, using external hardware, or streaming videos.However, there are two design issues that cause a not inconsiderable degree of frustration: the delete key is adjacent to the power button, and each are the exact same size and shape. Many times when I go to delete something, I hit the power button. It's a small inconvenience, but annoying, and could have easily been avoided.The second issue I've encountered is that the touchpad vacillates between oversensitive and under-sensitive without warning. Dragging the mouse around can be a chore, or it can jump around the screen with little to no warning.Other than those two issues, I'm happy as can be with the product. Would very much recommend if you can deal with those two flaws.",0
Good price and good quality. Does come with Windows S meaning you can only install applications from the windows store (no chrome) but other than that it's still a great value,0
"Great little Chromebook, no issues so far. I would recommend it.",0

After 10+ hours troubleshooting with windows and it’s still not fixed and conveniently out of the return period. I don’t recommend this device. It is flimsy- which is a little expected considering price. Also not a touch screen. Overall I would not recommend this laptop.",0
I love that the hinge can go 180 degrees because it makes it really nice to use for any situation.,0
Only thing I would say is you definitely need more storage and ram probably a ssd for it and it does get loud so you’ll need a laptop cooling stand as well or something to prop the laptop up so increase air intake,0
"Good computer, but Amazon royally messed up my order. After promising me the item would arrive at my doorstep on a specific date, I called UPS on that date who informed me it would not be coming. In the end I had to drive out to a UPS store and pick it up myself.After the shipping issues, I used this great laptop for two weeks before suddenly the screen would not turn on. External display worked just fine. I contacted MSI who said they would repair it as it was still under warranty, albeit for a $60 shipping cost.I contacted Amazon regarding the issue and they completely ignored me. I called, emailed and used a ticketing system. No response, not even a ""sorry, you are on your own"".I finally got the computer back and it runs like a beaut. It is hot underneath and I've gotten more blue screen crashes than I would have liked, but from the design of the computer to the internal specs, it really is great. Probably overpriced, but still cheap for high-end gaming laptops. Just beware that there is a lot under the hood that is probably fragile, and the manufacturers get it wrong more times than they like to admit. Hopefully you ordered this from someone other than Amazon, because they will give you no courtesy.",0
got it for my teenager for school and she loves it '.,0
"This laptop is fantastic. Light, with an aluminum shell. The keyboard has a little give, but that is pretty similar to my previous laptop and chromebook. The laptop moves quickly, the screen is bright and crisp, stays connected to the internet.

This MacBook is super fast and convenient to use. Typical Apple quality but yes you will have to pay a price for it. The M1 chip is amazing and worth it. Wish the bezels weren't as big but you can't get everything right? Highly recommend if you are a fan of Apple. Very lightweight and portable.,0

"For what I need, this is perfect. I have Zoom meetings on it and the screen quality is great. Watching a video the resolution is 1080hd. The camera quality is 720hd. Far and beyond better than my old laptop that died after many years of use. Since it does not have a built-in CD/DVD player, it is very light weight. I just purchased an external drive which is quite inexpensive. Glad I bought this.",0
So far so good. A lot of updates and over a fast connection approximately 3 hours of initial install. Backup recovery takes awhile too. Some bloat ware to remove. Easy to get fingerprints on keyboard area. Since HD is a hybrid really have to be careful about where to install/load data. The master OS will be full pretty quickly so remove old windows install files ASAP.Runs good but highly recommended adding the 8 ram from the start. Remember there is a screw under tape in middle when open back. Easy to remove and upgrade other than that.Will update once my songames on it. It’s a birthday gift. Set it up so he wouldn’t have too. I do know runs PUBG and overwatch well.,0

"I received my new Lenovo ideapad 320 today and I am taking it to the UPS to return it tomorrow. The machine is so ridiculously slow I felt like we are back in the dinosaur age. Every single click, it takes forever for the screen to change. At times I can go grab myself a snack, pour myself a drink, and wander back to see it's still loading. My expectation for this machine was not high - it's an extra machine for my 4th and 2nd graders to use for homework. With this machine, what would've taken 10 minutes would probably be more like 30, with most of the time waiting for it to react to every click and change. My kids won't tolerate this, and I certainly will not spend money for this. Googling online I see lots of reviews with the same issue - Amazon should not be selling this product at all!!!",0
"Everything works quite well except for one issue that is ruining my new laptop, whenever I use the scroll wheel to scroll down it undoes my last action. Quite like an undo button it closes tabs, ends programs, and stops whatever I did last. This is an issue I have never experienced before with no assistance on how to fix it. Honestly, I'm debating returning the laptop simply because it does not work properly.",0
"Aside from not having a back-lit keyboard and having an absolutely terrible battery life, this computer does the trick.",0
Bought this for my son's remote learning. The sound quality has become so poor his teacher can't understand him on this device. We have other devices in our house that work perfectly so it is clearly something wrong with this one.,0
Very fast great performing laptop at a reasonable price. The NVMe hard drive is a huge upgrade from my previous laptop that had a SATA hard drive.,0
"The laptop arrived on time. Its specs are very good for the price point. There doesn't seem to be another laptop with these specs at this price at the moment. Hard to find a 2070 for this price. Pleased with the build quality. Keyboard and trackpad feels good. Aesthetics-wise, the back side where the MSI logo is found can be a bit too gamer-y (especially compared to the stealth line of MSI), but in general, it's not very offensive anyway. Another gripe I have is that it is somewhat chunky for a normal laptop nowadays, but I feel that it is somewhat expected for a gaming laptop so that is not really a problem. It is just something to note for some people. It is also important to say though that it is LIGHT, despite how chunky it is. RGB is also very good compared to other gaming laptops if that is a consideration.Overall, I'm happy with the laptop. I would recommend purchasing this.",0
"Coming from gaming on a desktop. This has been life changing. The screen is so clear, i've had to upgrade my two desktop monitors. PubG and No Man's sky have ran smooth, and without a glitch. For it's price point, I would have have to look really hard to find this kind of value.The packing was really well thought out. Came to it's new home, safe, and sound.Looking forward to many hours of gaming, with wave two coming down the pipe.Will do a 90 day, and 6 month review.If you are on the fence, but it now.",0
"I had to do a bit of research to get the best bang for the buck for a budget gaming PC. Mainly using it to browse web, do some coding, and photoshopping. Nitro 5 is the first gaming laptop I've owned but I also owned other gaming desktop currently as well.Laptop arrived in good condition, and I immediately set it up. Charged it for an hour until it reaches 90% and then installed all the necessary updates. Do note that the laptop is a grease and fingerprint magnet. I find myself cleaning it with a microfiber towel and rubbing alcohol for the keys and palm rest every few days.A week later, I added another SATA SSD to the caddy they provided. I used the HDD cable that came with the laptop and installed a Crucial SSD 1TB. Then comes the 32GB RAM upgrade from the stocked 8GB. Ordered a Corsair 32GB (16GB x 2) 2666MHz SODIMM ram sticks and installed it. Crucial stated that this laptop can maxed out at 64GB RAM for the AN515-54-5812 Nitro 5 (2020).It's been a month since the purchase, and I haven't gotten into any other issues since then. Fan does run high at times, especially on High Performance mode spinning at 4K+ RPM.",0
"As much as I would have loved an Apple laptop .. so not in my budget! This Asus laptop is awesome - lightweight, huge 15.6 screen, nice long-lasting battery, and fast! Now I have my office computer and my personal laptop -- I'm really happy. You will be too!",0
"Excellent computer, came as advertised. Fast and lightweight, it's great for work or school. My screen had 2 dead pixels though",0
"La uso para trabajo y algun juego como Fornite, rinde muy bien en ambos casos.De ser unicamente para lo ultimo en juegos, puede que necesite mas disco, para tener varios instalados.Mi hijo tiene la misma con Ryzen 7 4800 y placa 1660ti de 6gb y anduvo tan bien que un a?o despues compramos esta.Maquina de sobra para un usuario promedio.",0
"This is a really solid starter gaming laptop, it really fits all my needs. Only thing worth mentioning is the RAM is only 8GB, I’d definitely recommend getting a 16GB upgrade, but it does come with instructions on how to upgrade with the laptop. Still, it’s a very solid choice.",0
"In 2007 I built my own gaming desktop, when I moved to college I spent $1800 on an Alienware gaming laptop which carried me from 2012-2017. Just bought this November of 17, and am extremely pleased. Lightweight, powerful enough to run all my steam games and MOBAs, with a great look and feel. All of this comes together in the most inexpensive computer I've ever owned.The only possible complaint I have is that the speakers do not get very loud, but the $30 I spent on an external speaker still puts the total cost of this hundreds of dollars below anything else I've owned.",0
"Light, easy to use, fast, easy transition from a life of windows devices.",0
Good buy for the money I use for school. I like the finger print scan to log in,0
"I am a MBP user for two decades and bought this Chromebook in order to install a software version of a utility I need at work. I am completely floored how great this system works, fast, ease of use the flawless Google app ecosystem integration and all this for $140. I feel like a sucker having shelled out 1200-2500 USD for Macs.",0
"All things considered I think this is a great laptop. Unfortunately, B came off within two days of use and there’s no easy way to fix it. Not a huuuge loss but does speak to less than stellar workmanship. Thankfully b is not as frequently used letter in my vocabbbulary .",0
"This worked well for 9 months and the battery died. The retailer sent it back for me and they replaced the battery. Six months later, the keyboard doesn't work for certain keys. This is a common problem and the fix is involved. HP should offer to fix these as the bent wires inside are apparently the defect. Guess I'll have to spring for an Apple MacBook as my iPad, iPod, and iMac have been impeccable. HP used to mean quality, but poor design and no company acknowledgemenet is bad.",0
Battery is too bad,0
"We bought this computer to replace one that was ""irredeemable"". It has an i5 Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3. I am not sure why the speed has increased, but we like it a whole lot better. The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on 24 hours a day. This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it. The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters----we do not search the web or receive e-mails. The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support. We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year. (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft ""updated"" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working. I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they ""updated"" my computer, and asked if they would fix it. They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge. At that point I was loud and angry. I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware. ""You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"". I said I would not pay such ransom ware money. I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one. I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing. They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"". I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.) An update to my review: the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker. I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge. No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------A further update on my refund----------The seller (Tech Deals Store) is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack. I have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer. If I don't receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund. If that doesn't work then I will file a dispute with my credit card company. ( I am not letting Tech Deals Store get by with this scam.) Further update---- Amazon gave me the $77.70 back. I hope I remember the name ""Tech Deals Store"" and never buy from these people again.",0
"I returned this after 2 weeks. The first thing i noticed is how dim and grainy the graphics were. But i was willing to deal...after all, it was cheap.But it gets HOT! Hot when in use, uncomfortably so. Hot when charging too...to the point where i was afraid to keep it plugged in while i wasnt home or slept for fear it would start a fire. And to have it charging while in use?- intolerable.I had an HP before this one and it didnt have these issues. I ended up getting an acer this time and it's WONDERFUL.",0
Good choice,0
Very good. Portable and durable,0
"This comes with a very nice 512 GB SSD, and it's an M.2 drive which means it's crazy fast.",0
"Where to begin. I have been using this laptop for about 7 months and I think it is worth of every penny spend on it and even more. I use my laptop daily, I work on it, do web searching, watch shows, but I mostly use it for gaming which is what this bad boy does best. I'm gonna divide my opinion on positives and negatives and then give a final conclusion.-Positives- -The 7th gen intel core and Rtx 2070 work amazing specially for heavy games, providing nice and flowing fps, I run big games like Battlefield, GTA, The Witcher, othes ehich require CPU like World of Warcraft, etc, and it has never let me down.-I really like how vivid colors are compared to other gaming laptops out there, most people won't notice or won't care but if you are one of those persons who like to watch TV shows on good quality screens or enjoy video games at it's best definitely this screen.-Thin screen, I love this; gives the laptop a modern, fresh looking appearance, some laptops look really bulky precisely because there is 1 inch of nothing on each side, making the laptop looking like a monitor from the 90's.-Nice looking keyboard, has many different combinations of colors and styles, I personally turn it down because I have always prefered nothing really, but it really helps if you need to type in a dark place. The keyboard is small but you will definitely get use to it (I hated laptop keyboards because how small they were, but now I love it)-Negatives--I don't like were the usb ports are located, I think a better job could've been done.-I'm not really sure about this one but it kinda gets a little bit hot like a gaming laptops because there is not enough room for ventilation, therefore it's a bit noisy. However this could be fixed with a pair of headphones and putting something under the laptop to raise so it disipates heat.-Short battery life like 90 min on maximum performance or approximately 170min on battery saver, again this is a gaming laptop they have a short battery life, I keep mine plugged in during gaming and havy stuff so it is not really a problem for me, I knew my needs from the beginning.In conclusion if you are the type of person who cares more about performance than anything else this is an extremely good option, if you don't bother about battery life and can still work with 2 h 30 min at savings it might work for you. Again this laptop was designed for heavy stuff and to offer an extraordinary performance for the users eho value it. If you need a quite, not designed for gaming or heavy programs computter get a mac.",0
The graphics are good,0
17.3 inch screen is good. RAM is Okay too. But the HDD failed within 3 months. To add to the pain there is no international warranty. Warranty was only valid for US. Need to spend extra $100 to get the new HDD. Lucky that Lenovo Singapore service center were quite helpful in reinstalling the Windows even though there wasn't any international warranty.,0
"They aren't kidding when they say this is thin and sleek. It has such a slim profile that it's sized like a small folder, so it's incredibly portable and easy to work on when traveling. The 13 inch screen in perfect when you need something bigger and easier to work/type on than a tablet, but don't want anything too big or bulky.Comparing this to my Acer Spin 5, the actual screen viewable area seems to be larger. The bezel frame around the Acer is wider, so the super slim frame around the Dell offers even more screen viewing real-estate.The touch screen is very responsive and I'm pleased they included a backlit keyboard. My Acer that's similar in style and design doesn't have a backlight, which has been an issue since the start. I never thought it would be a big deal, until I didn't have the backlight and I realized how difficult it can be to type in low light with black keys that have nothing to light them up.One thing that's very different between the systems is how few ports this computer has. This Dell has just a single type C port and an SD card slot. My Acer Spin 5 has two type C ports, an HDMI, two USB ports and an SD slot. However my Acer is a tiny bit thicker than this Dell. So you sacrifice additional ?ports for having an ultra slim design. Something to keep in mind when deciding on a computer, since what you connect to this Dell will be limited.The speakers sound quite good for such a small machine. The screen is bright and the colors are rich. The included graphics card has been able to run everything smoothly for me so far. While I don't game with this Dell, I do some video editing with it and the software has worked well without any lagging or crashing. About the only thing I could think of changing would be the inclusion of a single USB port, for use with some small wireless travel mice.",0
"I bought this product because I saw that it had 1TB of storage memory. But, when I received it and logged on to it, I discovered it only had 128GB.",0
"Perfect!! Happy so far, the pictures listed showed the keyboard in black & also white, but mine is all white which I wanted.. Very happy, user friendly, touch screen & convertible from laptop to tablet. Awesome price, thank you",0
It's every thing it was advertised.,0
"This was my first laptop buy so my opinion may be a little biased. Good size but weight is a little more than expected. Finger print scanner is super useful. Key board feels nice, similar to an apple external keyboard. The arrow keys are also funky, first time seeing two buttons crammed into one space. Power button on the side takes a little to get used to, I would accidentally push it when using things on the side. I wish there were music control function buttons. Performance is great, freezes up occasionally for about 2 seconds.",0
"We used Chromebooks in my Middle school classroom and I was pleased with how few problems I had to deal with. My only issue is I don’t have a wireless printer, and I haven’t taken the time to figure out how to connect this device so I can print.",0
"Over the time I have had this laptop, I have yet to encounter any issue. The screen shows games and such beautifully, the speakers work wonderfully, and it can collect clear audio when need be. All in all, it is a great laptop.",0
"This laptop runs everything I throw at it with rapid speed. The video card runs games smoothly, the SSD is blazing fast, WiFi 6 works nicely, DP port outputs to 4k 60FPS on my TV and so far I've only had some minor problems that are software related I had to fix. I'll admit the Gigabyte software isn't the best but once I fixed this issue it works fine. One thing annoying was it would reset the keyboard led back to the rainbow effect after you change it in the control center. To fix this I went into task manager in the startup tab and disabled FusionStartUp so now it keeps my changes. Not sure what FusionStartUp does because everything seems to be working great in the control center now. If you want a gaming laptop but don't want to shell out over $2000 then this is a great choice. I do wish they placed the power plug in the back instead of on the right side, but not a huge deal breaker. Maybe it's there because of the cooling fans inside since the fans can get fairly noisy, but it's better than having the GPU throttle etc since it's a 130 watt GPU. I would recommend this to anyone seeking a good gaming laptop in this price range who wants a 130 watt 3070 instead of a 3060. I've seen many laptops that were close to this price range that only had a 3060, so I figured I had to give it a chance and cross my fingers. I'll update my review if anything changes, but for now I'll give it a good review as I'm happy with my choice.",0
Bought this for my 86yoa dad. Simple and nothing complicated about it. He has thoroughly enjoyed it,0
"There are enough of this type of review that I shouldn't have risked it, but man, what a disappointment. It was a 'wow, you got into college' gift for a kid I tutor who just needed a basic laptop and he was so tickled and then the thing powered up, but the screen remained black. Then there was a 10-minute scramble trying all the tricks, the inevitable call to tech services and finally, the sad repacking it up to return it. I am not reordering it. Found a faster one, for less $ at a big box store that I am picking up in person today. Not a big deal but in terms of gift-giving, it sucked.",0
"a great little machine, love it!",0
"The left/right clicks does not extend to the lower corners of the pad, you have to click about one inch away from the lower corners of the pad if you want a mechanical click",0
"It is a worst laptop I have ever used! I would like to return this laptop. Please, do not buy this one!! If you have enough money to buy it, you'd better to tear that money because it will give you more pleasure.I ordered it on Feb 5, and the return window ended on Mar 10. Surprisingly, after Mar 10, the monitor of the laptop shows nothing! I can't see anything on the monitor so I can't do anything! How can I fix it when monitor shows nothing?? The power button shines when I press the button so, I think it is not a problem of adaptor or power.. I don't know what the problem is. XXXX",0
For some strange reason it developed a line in the screen which was weird in the right hand corner and the charger went bad after not even 6months of having it,0
"I got this laptop primarily to run Path of Exile, which was tanking on my old custom built PC (no surprise there, all the parts were 7+ years old). I thought I'd be getting a moderate improvement, but I was pleasantly surprised - the graphics card doesn't have any problems running the game, even though it's one of the most complex (and complained about) that I could have picked to test it. I haven't turned down any of the game's default settings except bloom.The keyboard is big enough to play on, although I immediately disabled the touchpad - I can't type without accidentally brushing it. Would love for the touchpad to be more straightforward to disable, to be honest.One thing that I'm a little irritated by is that all of the ports (and the power connection) are basically on the right side of the machine, so I don't have as much space for my mouse hand. I can see putting a USB over on the right, but I'm pretty set on having the power cable attach at the back. For my purposes, it would be great if it had an SD card slot (so I could use it to set up 3d prints) but a lot of current machines don't so I can't really complain.It stays fairly cool, unless a cat is sitting on it. I did pick up one of the cheap little laptop stands so it doesn't sit directly on the desk and that seems to increase cooling efficiency.The laptop is also nice and small, and light. Very easy to manage.",0
The Aluminum build feels so quality and there is no flex in the build,0
So far no issues and it functions as it should. Bought this for my daughter for online school and she loves it. Wish it had a backlight for the keyboard but otherwise I have no issue with it. Great speed and easy to navigate.,0
"Performs well, great screen. A chunky 17.3"". Very happy so far!",0
Great quality for a gaming laptop. Prime day price was worth it.,0
"First time I bought MSI and I'm really impressed. I consider myself an extreme power user, and I use this laptop for just about everything: gaming, coding, streaming, video editing, 3D rendering/modeling, etc. It runs Valorant at 144 FPS, and sometimes I use OBS to screen record while I play without degrading performance. 3d rendering works as expected for a 1660 GTX Ti GPU, just OK. I typically have 2 browsers running with multiple tabs and at least 2 or 3 other apps during the workday with no problems. I've used 17"" laptops exclusively in the last 15 years, and this one is by far the best. I would've loved to get a laptop with an RTX 20XX or 30XX, but I didn't want to spend $2500+ or downgrade to a 15"" screen. So I compromised on this one for the price point, and it's exceeded my expectations. The RGB is pretty cool and it was nice to be able to customize the colors and pattern. Overall solid laptop, and I'll be taking a look at MSI first when I eventually replace this one.",0
It is surprisingly small and light which are great qualities while still maintaining the feeling of a durable and structured laptop,0
Me encanta el producto muy practico muy versatil ademas muy facil de usar simplemente puedo decir que esta exelente el producto,0
Seems to be just what my daughter needed for school after pandemic . But then they never sent any work to do online that was mandatory,0
Worth the money,0
This is so dumb first day I buy it I play rainbow six siege the next day I come to play it won’t turn on!! I spent 800 dollars on this computer I expect to get a computer that lasts more than 1 day not happy!!,0
"Its not a bad piece of hardware, the chromebook works well enough, but the touchpad stopped working after a few months, just after the product was out of support. Pretty annoying. Would not recommend.",0
"I bought this computer for working on various graphics and photography programs. Ive only had it for a few weeks, but it is a vast improvement over my previous laptop. I am not a gamer so I cannot address its capability in that area. The computer was advertised to come with windows 10, but instead came loaded with windows 11 which is nice to get the most current program. The computer is slim and lightweight. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.",0
"Just got my new VivoBook today and getting setup was fast and easy. However, as another reviewer mentioned, the usb-c is for namesake. In my case it is faulty (I think) and I was relying on that port to connect with multiple display monitors. It failed to work with the multiple adapters that have worked fine on my Dell XPS13 (thunderbolt). As a workaround, ended up using the other USB 3.x port to connect via HDMI adapter. Otherwise, overall it is fast and light .. can't beat the price!",0
"Very pleased with my purchase of this computer. Very quiet, fast boot up, Nice touch screen. Very responsive keyboard. It is attached to three external hard drives. I have a massive music collection, a very large quantity of jpg files and about a terabyte and a half of video files. I am working on a multi media presentation of the history of the rock and roll era (1954 - 1985) This machine is doing quite a bit of the video editing, photo clean up, music file cleanup. It has been very good for my purposes up to this point and I do not expect it cause me any reason to change my mind.",0
High quality laptop - more than met expectations. Highly recommend if looking for a sleek and powerful personal computer,0
"works great, fast, great screen, no problems,very happy with it",0
"I bought this as a gift for my wife, so she can do some work stuffs and play video games. All games run on 60+ fps or more without issues at 1080p.",0
"El procesador Ryzen 5 y los gráficos AMD Radeon hacen de esta computadora algo mucho más versátil y eficiente en comparación con los procesadores intel. Definitivamente una gran compra por el precio. Además Windows 11 corre como un sue?o en esta computadora. Es fluído, muy amigable con el usuario y definitivamente funcional pensando en mis necesidades como usuario.",0
"Great laptop. Construction seems pretty sturdy for a plastic body. Have only used for a few hours but so far it seems like a computer that has great power and speed for its price point. The keyboard keys have a good action to them new, but we’ll see how they hold up as the keyboard gets broken in. I was surprised how big the charger is, but overall the entire computer with charger is still not that heavy. Cooling seems good so far. I think the only thing I’m not a big fan of is the big logo on the front looks a bit cheap, but honestly this doesn’t effect the quality of the computer as a whole. Would definitely recommend.",0
"The items is working so great, even in a way i didn't expect according to the previous reviews a saw i was afraid a lit tile bit but when i got the laptop it was instead working and looking good. i recommend it.",0
"Purchased this unit because of dissatisfaction with Lenovo Flex 11 which was purchased first. I will post a separate review for the Lenovo Flex. Unfortunately the main positives of this Samsung unit compared to the Lenovo Flex is its 64GB eMMC hard drive (the Flex only has 32GB capacity) and the micro SDHC card slot works (I have a 128GB card inserted which does not stick out but is flush against the side of this unit) whereas I could not successfully insert any SD card into the card reader of the Flex. Also, for the Flex it appeared that any SD card inserted would still have one third to half of the card sticking out which would make it less than ideal as a permanent way to expand it onboard 32GB eMMC memory. The screen on this unit is passable but not as sharp or vivid as the screen on the Flex. The onboard speakers is extremely disappointing. With volume set to 50%, the sound from the Flex is robust and sufficiently loud to watch videos or listen to music without resorting to earphones. However on this Samsung unit, when volume is set at 50%, the sound is faint(er) and less clear. In order to achieve the same audio experience of the Flex, I had to increase the volume to over 80% if I wanted to listen to sounds coming from the speakers. Can’t speak to whether the same problem exists when using earphones as I have not plugged in and used earphones on either units. Overall I am disappointed with the performance of this unit even though it technically “works” and does everything one would expect from a Chromebook. Only reason why I even bothered to buy this unit (and the Lenovo Flex 11 from a different online retailer, the one which ends in egg) is because my Toshiba Chromebook is getting old (but actually performs better than either of these two newer units) and my Google Chromebook Pixel (2013 model) is no longer able to receive the newest Chrome OS updates but also still performs better than either of these two units. Ending on a positive note, the Google Play Store works fine for both this Samsung unit and the Lenovo Flex. Had no problem installing my go-to Android apps onto either unit (e-readers, Chinese dictionary, video players with more features than what Chromebooks can normally do/play). On side note, did have to purchase a cover (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GNE4QMO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) because this Samsung unit felt too flimsy to carry around in my backpack without something to protect it from scratches and nicks. The iPearl mCover hard shell case fits well (even if I do think it’s somewhat pricey for what it is).",0
The power brick is huge,0
"I bought this for my mom last Christmas. I recently asked her how she liked it, turns out it does not have a touchscreen",0
I didnt like anything the thing never worked it showed up with maxed memory i couldnt do a thing with it its totally worthless i might use it for a sinker to go fishing,0
"Ok, so let's start from the screen which is LCD that is worse than an LED-LIT, and the bad processor time to respond, processor count is 1 as it says in details , cheap SSD and 8GB RAM is not enough for heavy gaming, im so sad that I purchase this over the Helios300 with LED-LIT screen + gtx1060 + DDR4 16GB RAM + 256GB SSD and a 3.8 processor speed which is much better than a 2.8. All of that with a difference of 90$.Edit: I had no experience in laptop's when I purchased it, if I went back in time I would choose the predator helios 300 over the GL62M.Edit: at 10th of September 2019 I sold my laptop for a new acer predator helios 300 2019 model, farewell my first gaming laptop.",0
screen plays them beautifully with that high refresh rate,0
All around its a good laptop. Its fast and reliable. However... there is nearly zero gaming potential. This thing only has 0.13 go of vram so anything other than minecraft and games of similar simplicity are a no go. Though it can do Xbox gamepass no problem. With all that said everything else is great.?,0
"This thing is named right. It is swift. I have been impressed with this little machine, especially the i7-1165G7 CPU. For its size and the price, it outperforms some of the other, more expensive gaming laptops I have. Here's what I thought. WHAT I LOVESIZE:This is a thin and light laptop that lives up to its name. It's very easy to grab this laptop with one hand and, although not recommended, carry it under your arm. It is very light and thin.PERFORMANCE:For such a small footprint, this thing really performs. I was very impressed with the i7-1165G7 chip that comes with Intel's Iris Xe graphics. I ran some benchmarks (see images) in Geekbench 5, comparing it against two gaming laptops and a Dell Inspiron. And while it can't compete with the Inspiron, the CPU actually beats the other two gaming laptops I have that were both purchased within the past year. There's also the integrated Iris graphics. While you wouldn't expect an iGPU to be competitive with dedicated graphics, this little thing is nothing to skoff at. Out of curiosity, I loaded Far Cry 5 to see if it was playable with the Iris graphics, and I was able to get an average approaching 50 frames per second with lowered settings. This would've been unthinkable on previous integrated Intel graphics.RAM AND BOOT SPEEDS:The first thing that actually blew me away about this little laptop is the startup speed. I have 7 PCs and all of them have either SATA or NVMe SSDs for booting. However, none of them come even close to how quickly this laptop boots. I timed the startup from total shutdown to Windows desktop at between around 5-6 seconds. Unbelievable! The SSD measured at around 2100MB/s read and 1150MB/s write, which is not even close to the fastest NVMe speeds I've seen. To explain the quickness of this laptop, I have to chalk it up to how well it's built and the speed of the RAM, which runs at a speedy 4200Mhz. WHAT I DON'T LOVEBATTERY:When I first saw this laptop, I was excited to see that the advertised battery length was up to 16 hours! And I understand that -- for the most part -- you're not going to get what is advertised. Usually, you're lucky to get about 60-70% of that, but I'd be more than happy to have 12 hours of battery. My other laptops, which all advertise 8 hours of battery, I'm lucky to get 5 hours of battery life. But, that's where I was really disappointed. The most I've gotten out of this battery is about 8-9 hours. Usually, I'm right around 5 hours (see image) and this is only using Chrome to read websites and chat via Slack. What happened Acer? Why are they advertising 16 hours. There's no scenario I could do that would get me 16 hours, unless I turned the display off and ran no applications at all. This isn't real-world. I would be happier with advertised battery life of up to 10 hours. That's fine, but this makes me question other specs.UPGRADEABILITY & CONNECTIVITY:The RAM is great. I love the speed, but why not allow us to upgrade? That RAM is soldered to the motherboard and they give us no options to upgrade -- whatsoever. So, you're stuck at 8GB. It would be so nice to bump this up to 16GB and use with Photoshop for my job; however, that will never happen so this laptop will forever stuck at 8GB. Very disappointing.It also would've been nice for Acer to include a microSD slot. The quickest way to upgrade your storage -- and add mobility to that storage -- is via a microSD card. However, there is no slot so you'll be forced to buy a reader and attach it to USB if you want that capability. The rest of the connectivity is adequate. There is no ethernet connection, but there is a full HDMI port, which is a nice touch for a thin & light, and there are also two USB-A ports and a USB-C port, which has full Thunderbolt 4 support and can charge the laptop as well. THE REST-Everything else on the laptop is adequate.-The WiFi works fine. I measured 80Mbps downloads from my ISP on this compared with 105Mbps from my desktop, which is ethernet. So, while it's not nearly as fast as a wired connection. It's adequate.-The Bluetooth 5.1 seems to work well.-The display is fine for 14"". It's full HD at 60Hz and has a full brightness of 300 nits, which is fine.-The keyboard feels just OK, but has VERY little key travel. It's 14"" so there is no numpad; however, it would have been nice for Acer to try and fit in full-size arrow keys, even at the expense of other keys. I can't tell you how many times I've press arrow up or down and ended up hitting page up or down. I really hate those small arrow keys, but I guess sacrifices had to be made.-The facecam is about what you would expect. Not great quality, but good enough for Zoom meetings, etc.-The speakers actually sound pretty decent and you're able to make out lower frequencies pretty well, even if they are buried a bit. The stereo separation is nice, but you'll have to crank that volume up, though, as anything below around 70% is nearly inaudible thanks to the speakers being located on the bottom of the unit. OVERALL-Overall, this is an excellent laptop that is quite fast and powerful, especially for its size. It charges fairly quickly, is very lightweight and despite a few missing bells and whistles, is just about everything you'd want in a thin & light. Five stars.",0
"I love my MacBook Air! I chose gold, it’s such a beautiful classy color. It came in original packaging packed very safely. I haven’t tried the camera yet.I switched to iPads since 2010 and haven’t missed crashing windows one bit. I needed to do a few things my iPad wouldn’t do a Mac it was! The battery life is amazing, and the screen brightness is great, I’ve heard it isn’t bright as the MacBook Pro but I can’t believe anything would be brighter! I can’t put the brightness but half way up.",0
"Bought this for my 9yr old daughter that is homeschooled, she works online for core subjects. This laptop is light weight, keypad lights up. Was in very nice shape, it's more than fast enough for our needs. Arrived as promised.",0
"Muy liviana, buena potencia como para usar cualquier software de Adobe, los videojuegos del momento a calidad medium y algunos en High.La bateria me parece buena (unas 5 hrs) para uso de ofimatica, navegar por internet, escuchar musica todo momento y el brillo al 80%.",0
the worst laptop ever.,0
It freezes when i playing fortine and it’s no even in high grafic. Trash!,0
I haven't been dissapointed. Mainly used for college and some light gaming but whenever I use it for anything else it has done well. Battery life is fine and I'm not worried about breaking it.,0
Good product for the price. Not super great quality but certainly does the trick.,0
"I purchased this Chromebook to use as a travel computer instead of my 15-inch laptop. It meets those needs very nicely. I use Chrome as my browser, so the transition was virtually seamless. The most significant adjustment is the smaller keyboard size that makes touch-typing difficult, but I am adapting. For the price, a great deal.",0
"Battery Life, touch screen, display quality, and bio-metric login. If you were considering the HP Spectrum x360, get the XPS 13 instead.",0
Received at the right time to assist with job,0
I put it in my backpack with the power brick and its heavy.,0
I've had it one month and turns out the keyboard is faulty. It won't turn on now because the power button is in the keyboard and the keyboard is faulty. It won't turn on now after I shut it off last night.,0
"I was looking everywhere for a laptop that didn't cost an arm and a leg, but was made well enough that I knew it'd last an ok amount of time. I think I finally hit the nail on the head! This laptop's specs for the price are just awesome! I almost went with another brand of computer, but I think it's worth paying a little extra money for longevity, better quality, and better customer service. Not to mention, the Lenovo backpacks they make for them are pretty awesome.",0
"Love my new MacBook Air!! Light, sleek, long lasting battery, plug & play! Surprised it does not have regular USB ports, but ordered 2-pack of USB to USB-C adapters for $10. Love all my Apple products from their packaging to their long lasting durability and fantastic performance/technology.",0
Nice sleek style slim not too heavy. I use for any work that I have to do that I can’t use my iPad,0
"La compre hace dos meses y se empezó a apagar aleatoriamente, a alguien le pasa algo similar?",0
Great purchase,0
It's missing a 4 gb ram......well I'm just going to use my old part of my laptop,0
"Great machine, amazon send the laptop ok",0
"Stable, fast, well designed. Average sound but very good monitor. This is a better alternative to Dell which I use for work, it’s really a great buy at this price too, I like it so much I ended up buying two.",0
"I bought this laptop for my favorite game, it worked great for about 9 months. Now the screen is shaky and images are blurred. I have tried several troubleshooting methods. It seems to be a bad graphics card.",0
"I opened it for the second time and the screen has a defect, like where it hinges flexed or something and now has a discolored spot at the bottom right.",0
it is okay thus far.,0
I am really disappointed with this purchase. We have had to switch to an online forum like many businesses so I need more laptops to connect with our students. All we are using this for is the internet and it is extremely slow.,0
"You get what you pay for. It's got the latest 11th gen Intel and 30 series Nvidia, so no slouch in 1080/1440 gaming. THUNDERBOLT 4 means you can add some awesome and useful external hubs or EGPUs (you could theoretically just upgrade your graphics card next year instead of buying a whole new PC).My only gripe with this ""gamer"" laptop is that it doesn't come with XMP support. You can't turn it on and it isn't enabled by default. So any RAM you buy could end up running at a much slower speed than advertised. My 3200 RAM with tight timings ended up with 2666 loose timings due to no XMP. If they had included XMP, this laptop would be perfect within its' current price range ($1600).",0
Bought this for my fiance as he needed something mobile to use. Amazing hardware for the price. The screen is what they get you with. If you have a good viewing angle and are not used to looking at high quality desktop monitors or 4k tv screens you shouldn't notice it too much.This isn't made for gaming or watching movies with stunning color and crispness so do not expect that. I would recommended it more for its ability to do all the other things you would want from a laptop but you still have enough screen quality to not feel like you're watching an old tube tv from the 70s.,0
For now excellent,0
"In spite of the description shown with this ASUS laptop, it does NOT have backlit keyboard. Also had hard time installing Microsoft Office. Could have used the voice instruction that helped me start up.",0
Excellent school laptop.,0
the alternate keys now light up so you can see them in the dark,0
"La cámara podría ser mejor, pero funciona muy bien y es muy versátil.",0
"Great laptop for the money. Some licensed items have to be purchased separately, due to user need. Processor is slower than expected, but still good PC.",0
The laptop is too heavy to carry.,0
"Light weight. Fast, especially on startup. No problem with the black on grey keyboard lettering. No touchscreen, whatever. I knew I wasn't going to like the track pad for the mouse, so dropped $20 on trackball, nbd. What I didn't expect was that one month after purchase machine would completely lose the wifi card. Like gone. One day woke up, no wifi, no driver, no hardware, NO ICON. Nothing. Can't find it. OS troubleshoot says connect ethernet cable. THERE IS NO ETHERNET PORT ON MACHINE. Didn't think I'd need one, features went on and on about how blazing fast the wifi was. What wifi? No wifi here. Randomly had a cheap usb wifi dongle in a drawer, amazing luck. Connect to internet. Run windows update, wifi back! Hooray! Two days later, where's the wifi? What wifi? No wifi here. Doesn't look like there ever was. Back to the dongle. Run windows update, nothing. Uh oh. Update drivers, nothing. Update BIOS, nothing. Uninstall / reinstall drivers, nothing. HP diagnostic program is a joke. Won't run unless I'm connected to the internet. What? How's that supposed to help troubleshoot connection issues? Device manager has no hardware/drivers. Not even hidden ones. Hours of research on the internet. Tried a bunch of command prompt stuff people said worked for them. Nothing. Countless restarts. Long story short error 45 accross the board, no hardware detected. I'm giving up. 1 month into my 2 year protection program, but not worth time or energy to send back. Dropped $35 on a better wifi dongle, gonna roll with that for time being. Now both usb a ports are in use (mouse and wifi). Not happy! If anything else goes wrong, will change review to one star. Tldr; SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH WIFI HARDWARE!!! USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PURCHASING!!!",0
"This is a great little web-surfer. Picked it up for my mother-in-law and she loves it. The battery life is AWESOME, too!",0
Used for personal use. No complaints about battery life.,0
"This is a decent compact laptop. I've been using it for several months with no real issues. I like the speedy SSD instead of a hard drive; it is smaller (256GB) but well worth it for the faster response times. I'm not a fan of Windows 10 but this laptop makes it run tolerably. It is very thin and light due in part to no optical drive. The blutooth and wifi work fine with reasonable range. The backlit keyboard can easily be set to off, dim, or bright using a key shortcut. The hi-res display looks great watching videos, and the touchscreen is a nice plus, esp. with Windows 10.I didn't run performance tests for gaming (I'll leave that to others), but if you are looking for a mid-level compact laptop for general use, this is a great choice. The only upgrades I'd want are a bigger SSD and an external optical drive.",0
The boot time is fast due to the SSD hard drive,0
Great price for this chrome book!,0
It serves its purpose.,0
"The computer is an Intel Core i7, so you know it is going to be fast and powerful",0
"I am very disappointed, and would like my money returned.",0
"Fantastic laptop, best laptop I’ve ever owned.",0
wife loves it,0
It is completely modern and efficient computer.,0
best laptop i have bought i recommend this great gaming computer i actually bought 2 of these one for me and my son love this computer,0
I can't even rate this laptop since it came with no power cord! Since when are laptops sold without a power cord?,0
The computer is really thin and that is what I was looking for a gaming computer,0
Arrived on time and looks as described!,0
"The laptop is great! It runs very well and smooth every game I've tried on it... However it get really hot! Temperatures go above 90 degrees, but it can be fixed by undervolting the battery a little without loosing performance.",0
"For the price point this is a very good gaming laptop. There are definitely higher end laptops out there, but at a much higher price tag. For an introduction to the gaming laptop world or if you don't plan on playing newer games on max settings, this is definitely a good bet.",0
"3060 has 105 Watt TDP, but no IGP to dedicated GPU switch. Battery life is about 4-5 hours (with CPU set to minimum and 50% brightness + IGP only). Minor keyboard flex, but keys feel good. Touch pad is very responsive, but has loud tap in the center. Display is very good, minimal light bleed. Display hinges feel solid, minimal to zero wobble when open. Metal laptop base, plastic bottom, plastic display lid. Good amount of storage expansion options - 2x NVMe, 1x 2.5"" SATA. Comes with WiFi 6 (802.11ax) standard - good range and good speeds.Requires lots of prying in the back to open. CPU / GPU fans run much quieter compared to 2019 model. Comes with 230watt AC adapter, and that prevents battery drain during gaming (a complaint I had with the 2019 9570H-1660ti Model). Minimal BIOS settings - no XMP, no voltage settings.I upgraded mine with 32GB OLOY CL18 3200 RAM as it will run at 3200 CL18 without needing XMP. Package, unboxing & presentation had a more premium feel to it.",0
Less than a year old and it has stopped charging.,0
Tootal laptop is good but Battery is very bad and,0
"was looking for a very lightweight 2 and 1 that was easy to use; this is not iy. I've already returned it. I't;s bulky, awkward and the ""pen"" is almost impossible to pull out for use (other reviews had that warning).If it suits you it might be a value for the price point.",0
Good overall for home and school use.,0
Quiet as promised; my previous laptop was much more noisy but this Acer is a pleasure to use. The only thing I don't like is that when the screen is dark you can notice backlights at the edges. But it happens when the screen is completely dark so it's not a big deal.,0
Has worked well. It is used for our church accounting program.,0
"The speaker stopped working in a month. Please don't buy this product if you are planning to use it in a different country. Their warranty only works in the country you have purchased it in. I moved to a different country and now the local Lenovo refuses to service the laptop, even if it's only a month old. I called so many times and all they did was transfer the call from one person to another. When I asked to speak to the manager, they refused to transfer me to them. I received no help from Lenovo. Please don't buy this Junk Laptop.",0
Love it and works perfectly!,0
"I appreciate that the price was discounted for a great value. The package was secure and well-packaged, which was very important, given that this was delivered via mail. No cracks on the screen. The processing speed is quick, which is extremely helpful! I appreciate there were instructions, in a small pamphlet, that explained how to transfer everything from your previous MacBook to this MacBook. A seamless transition is vital and means less frustration. This MacBook Air is very user friendly, especially visually. As someone who wears glasses, I appreciate the option to make the pointer larger, the ability to have more contrast, etc... That the user manual automatically pops up and walks you through enhancements and new features makes this even more user-friendly.",0
"Producto tardo 3 semanas de llegar. Pero la paciencia es lo primero.El notebook a pesar de su bajo precio, cumple con los requisitos de lo que uno pideRecomendadisimo",0
"Me llego a tiempo y en exelente condiciones! Lo recomiendo muchísimo.Tener en cuenta que se calienta bastante y el ventilador hace ruido. Si lo mantienes elevado con algo en las esquinas, así los ventiladores agarran mas aire de abajo y se enfría.Pero los juegos me corren super bien! No me quejo de nada; lo uso también para la universidad y no se traba en nada.Te recomiendo comprarte mas almacenamiento si lo utilizas para jugar muchos juegos.Por lo general, es buen producto.",0
The build is awesome made me feel like I was using a premium device And the hand touch is not bad at all.,0
Got it to my pictures on. Thought it was like a small laptop. No it is like a large ipod. So it will not work for what I wanted. So I'm not using it.,0
the power cable that comes with it is short.,0
"Bought March 9th 2022, today is August 21st 2022. Replaced power cord a moth ago, today the laptop fried and died.",0
I use this laptop for casual video/photo editing and this laptop can easily finish these tasks due to its high-performance 6-core processor and amazing GTX 1060 graphics card,0
run finger on the edges especially near the track pad it has flex and makes a clicking sound.,0
First it took over eight hours for the the laptop to update. Took another hour for the setup to complete. Once everything was said and done and I created my account I was able to use the laptop twice. On the third attempt the Laptop went through the Lenovo load screen to the password screen. Once at this screen the keyboard would not work the bar to type in the password would not show up to type in the password. I spent over an hour on the phone and then an additional 30 mins on chat help to try and resolve the issue. I was finally told there was nothing they could do for me as it appears to be a software issue.The laptop worked great for the first two rimes I was able to use it. The time frame for this issue to appear was one week after unboxing. I do not recommend this item.,0
Nice screen quality and easy to use!,0
the sound quality is very bad and does not go very loud,0
"No hubo problemas con el envio, llego muy bien embalado y el funcionamiento de la laptop es optimo.Muy satisfecho!",0
Perfectly functional,0
Gets hot quickly. Heavy computer.,0
"I'm so glad I purchased this laptop. I first got the 17"" version from costco and it had issues from the start. I never got it to work properly. I found this one on amazon and decided to take a chance. Best decision ever. The smaller vesion is also more practical - it will fit the carryon luggage better and it's soooooo light. I love it. Also, I use it for business - quickbooks and some design software and it's super fast and can handle all my work without freezing on me. Even though it's so light the shell is super tough - I sat on it accidentally and there was no damage! If you're looking for a work laptop with large RAM, that's light weight this is the one. It also said it didn't have the touch screen but it does! Cherry on top!",0
The fans are always up in speed,0
"I ordered this September 15, 2021. About a week ago (October 2022) it wouldn’t turn on anymore. I took it in to have it looked at and was told that a screw came loose and caused damage to the battery and then the motherboard. I am spending over $500 to get it all fixed. It’s ridiculous that I would have this issue a year in.",0
"As reviewed. Lightweight, plenty of power, and good battery life.",0
"Pleasantly surprised by the quality of these refurbished devices. I orded several for my 2nd grade class. They are fast, easy to use and seamless between applications. Awesome battery life. I plan on ordering for my personal use. Great quality and great price!",0
"Tenía la necesidad de una computadora con características para edición de video y diseño gráfico. Los softwares son pesados y duros al trabajar con ellos.Al comprar la computadora tenía dudas por que el precio era muy bueno y encontré algunos malos comentarios en cuanto a la pantalla.Al día de hoy ya hace más de un mes que compré la pc, y he quedado conforme con mi compra. El precio del producto es muy bueno, hasta el momento lo único que es malo, es el audio de la computadora, ya que el volumen es bajo; pero no se puede esperar un precio tan bueno, por tan buenas características, y no tener que sacrificar ciertas áreas.Sin duda la volvería a comprar.",0
"Es un excelente equipo, una buena relación precio-beneficio, muy buen sistema de anfriamiento.",0
past few weeks it seems a new key on the keyboard stops functioning,0
Awesome laptop,0
its great fantastic build quality beautiful screen best 1500 purchase ive done in a long time!,0
Easy to upgrade. Added another TB of NVME m.2 and 32gb of ram to the base model and it was much cheaper and probably better components. Runs 1080 low to mid in 144 frames in just about everything,0
"INCREDIBLE LAPTOP, SSD MEMORY MAKES THIS LAPTOP FLY AND SCREEN IS BEAUTIFUL, ALSO BATTERY IS AMAZIN",0
Received in Aug 19. Used very lightly. Initiated a update and computer stopped working. Took to my computer tech and was told mother board appears to have failed. Guess HP is not the reliable manufacture it use to be.,0
"Replaced a 10 year old MacBook pro (spinning harddrive, one-hour batter life, spinning beach balls). Updates are smooth and backing up is seamless. Able to set it up to limit the tech to just what she needs (right click, what does that do?). She was very hesitant to get a new computer, as her old one ""works"". 6 months later, she said she wouldn't go back. Its light with a for-ever battery life. Thanks, Apple!",0
TODO BIEN,0
"The laptop is gorgeous but beware of the touchpad as it wobbles and has like a false click when you're using it; this is by now a known issue and my unit was affected by it. I'm evaluating my replacement options right now but it seems it's hard to get an unit without this or worse issues.Update1: Dell wants to replace the part with an on-site technician visit but they are backordered. Will update this review if this works.Update2: Almost 30 days after purchase and 20 days since contacting support Dell has not scheduled the technician visit as the order is backordered. Beware when buying this laptop, a lot of them present this issue.Update3: I have received 3 units of this laptop so far (two replacements). The QA is really bad, they all had touchpad or screen issues, the latest one having flex to click issues (google: ""flex to click xps 9500""). BTW the technician visit on update2 was never scheduled and the ETA was moved up twice. If you're picky with touchpads or quality of your purchases don't buy this model. Reducing my review to one star.",0
"It has a nice, wide screen. I had to buy stick-on letters for the keyboard after three months because the lettering wore off...as it usually does. Have had no other issues and really like this machine!",0
"I've bought and used Lenovo thinkpad LT for 10 years and have been very happy with durability, quality. I've never had a problem with one. Bought a new T480 in July 2019 and am very happy with it; same quality as all the other thinkpads I've used. However this E595, which I bought recently has two problems.1. It intermittently will not come out of hibernation mode. the Lenovo logo appears, then disappears and the screen remains black. The only way I've found to recover is to reboot using the power button. Looking at W10 event viewer/windows log/system, the AMD radon video system faults and doesn't recover. After the failure there are 2 of the same error messages in a row: ""Display driver amdkmdap stopped responding and has successfully recovered."" However the driver does not recover. I've tried deleting and reloading the display driver, no improvement. Also, am using the current driver released from Lenovo. If you google this error message, there are a number of users having the same problems. The workaround is to disable hibernation mode, and (so far) this does stop the fault. I phoned Lenovo CS. They recommended I return the LT to them for troubleshooting and repair/replacement. I believe this is a SW problem either with Lenovo bloatware or the AMD driver.2. All thinkpads I have used in the past, including the T480 have a nice radius at the bottom of the palm rest (the case edge below the trackpad). The palm of your hand rests against this edge while you are typing. The E595 has a sharp edge which makes this LP uncomfortable to use.In other respects the E595 is a nice machine. Its quick and the video display color and resolution is great. However because of the video driver issue and the sharp edge on the palm rest, I would not buy another E959 or recommend it.",0
"I absolutely love this laptop. Touchscreen is amazing, plus the versatility in being able to fold the screen completely back into a tablet. Tons of power in the processor and the RAM included. It's just a perfect tool for either home or work use, and I should know - I do both with it!",0
The 12-thread processor is great for rendering on the go,0
Very pleased with my new notebook. Works perfect for me and at the right price.,0
"We ordered these as Christmas gifts from Santa for all 3 of my kids. We have had nothing but problems ever since setting them up yesterday. One of the 3-the speakers only work about 1/2 of the time and the charger (which looks different than the other 2 chargers) only works about 1/2 the time as well. Another one was a complete pain to set up because somehow the wifi driver wasn't even installed (I honestly think one of the 3 that I got was a returned computer that hadn't been completely factory reset or something). Other than the graphics and the fact that the kids can actually play games on them, I'm really disappointed with them.",0
My son describes this as the best first gaming laptop. He seems to love and enjoy this laptop. Haven’t had any problems yet.,0
WORKS VERY WELL AM PLEASED WITH IT,0
"I don't mean this to sound negative because this beast has delivered more than I expected, but there are some points to be made. Firstly, my laptop arrived with a dead pixel on it, which isn't such a bad thing, it's just I needed the laptop in a certain amount of time because I was going somewhere so I had no time to get it fixed or replaced, which MSI says that it will do within a year of purchasing the laptop. The things I don't really enjoy is how frail it is. The amount of screen damage that has been inflicted onto this laptop is astounding in relation to how well I treat it. At this rate I feel as though I should have put a fabric sheet in-between it and the keyboard every time I close it. It's not like I'm putting caltrops in-between the laptop when I close it, but maybe it's simply just sand that's causing the damages. I'm not a sand seller and if it is the problem it's singular specs. In total i've got a dead pixel here, a scratch there, another scratch there, all I can think about is how much it's going to cost me to fix this screen, but that's a future me problem. And hopefully a future problem for you aswell, a problem I hope you find a solution for, the person purchasing this laptop. Otherwise it will run whatever you want, I mean what can't a RTX 2060 run? Also there's a factory seal sticker blocking you from removing the bottom plate of the laptop, which I hope isn't a void sticker in addition because you need to remove the bottom plate to insert any sort of additional storage device, because I can guarantee you that if you bought this laptop to play videogames the 500gb M.2 isnt going to cut it one bit. So just start off by buying an additional WD 1-2TB 2.5in SSD and probably just get a Samsung 970 Evo 1-2tb M.2 also to replace the one that the laptop comes with and just sell the 500gb one to someone who needs a M.2. The laptop gets hot but it's expected and with the max fan button it can still get too hot to leave on your skin or shorts. The battery lasts about 30 seconds not on charge, that's an exaggeration but don't expect to take more than a breath or two without it on the charger. 144Hz is a fantastic refresh rate to play videogames on, once you go to it, you don't go back. Also maybe I'm just stupid and didn't see that this screen was G-sync but i've never seen any screen tearing. The keyboard even though it can change colors doesn't have the same compatibility to do color changes as a external SteelSeries keyboard, like the apex pro. This review is getting long but these are things that I think are necessary to talk about, especially if you're thinking about buying a gaming laptop. Also you can change the global settings from the Nvidia control panel to force the computer to always use the RTX but if you don't some games will naturally choose the onboard graphics unit via the processor, so if you're having problems with framerate open up the settings and see what video device it's using. The keyboard feels nice and clicky, and so does the mousepad which I really like, I don't use the mousepad but I like that it's clicky. The speakers are abysmal, my phone is louder than the speakers, but they have Nahimic which will louden up things. Mine doesn't work anymore and just crashes as soon as it launches but that's neither here nor there, I need to reinstall it. I can't think of anything else to say.",0
Perfect for my use case. No problem so far and I have three of these working 24/7,0
It plays better than my Razor which cost a few hundred dollars more than my daughter's Lenovo,0
"Bought it before two months, but using it all-day for about two weeks. I'm using it as business laptop (software engineering), not for gaming purposes, and I am quite sure it is best value for money if you need performance laptop.Battery: More than 4 hours of everyday usage and/or software development without any problem. Extremely fast charging.Display: Regardless of many negative reviews, FHD TN display is not a dealbreaker for me - if you are sitting in front of your notebook most of the time, you will forget about slightly worse viewing angles very soon. Simply, in my opinion it is not worth to pay 25-30% more for 4K display.Keyboard: Very good, backlight is very helpful and it is very comfortable to use. Numpad is useful, even if I always prefer keyboard with classic, fully separated numpad.Speakers: Impressive, at the same time in terms of sound quality as well as loudness. Haven't noticed distortion even at highest volume.Fans/cooling: Very quite during everyday notebook usage.",0
"Good, was a gift for someone, no complaints",0
"I've had this laptop for about a week. It's my first gaming laptop and I love it. I'm using this laptop for work, school, and gaming. It does all I need it to with some added flair.The graphics are beautiful and my games look better and run well. I like that it's light for a gaming laptop and it's pretty portable. I like the MSI has settings to help protect the battery life for those that are plugged in most of the time. The camera quality is really nice for video calls/meetings. I like that I can use bluetooth devices.Since it is a gaming laptop, I expect the fan to be loud when it's on full blast. This isn't much of an issue but it can get noisy for those in voice calls. It gets pretty smudgy even if i wash my hands kind of often. It took a bit to get used to the speakers being on the bottom, though I imagine as a gaming laptop it anticipates gamers having a headset.Again, lovin' it.",0
