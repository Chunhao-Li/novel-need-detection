"(Bon achat): J'aime beaucoup le portable. La grosseur et le look.L'utilisation du pad est très fluide et glisse particulièrement bien comparativement à tous les autres pad que j'ai utilisé.Les performances sont très intéressantes.Le clavier numérique me manque comparativement à d'autre portable.Le seul point négatif c'est qu'il a toujours l'air sale à cause qu'il est noir. Donc, dès que nous y touchons, des empreintes de doigts ou de main apparaissent.",0
(Slim design and great graphics): Nice graphics and a durable design,0
"(very nice): I am very satisfied with this little laptop. It is everything that was said, lightweight, simple to figure out and easy to manage. I only use this for home use, but I have always loved HP's, so you can't go wrong with buying this one. The delivery was 2 days, and even the box was in nice shape.",0
"(Good product but . . . non-existent support): Great laptop; very fast processor (i7), good RAM memory and nice solid state drive; there is no Touch Screen so don't know why Amazon wanted a rating on it; there are 2 issues: support is only by email (almost useless for computers) and although it says it will support 2 monitors, it will ONLY if you close the laptop's lid; video card only supports a ""TOTAL"" of 2 monitors so don't plan on using the laptop's screen if you intend to use 2 external monitors - lid must be closed for it to display on both external monitors",0
(Avoid!!!): Stop working after a couple months.Right after the return window closed.,0
(Good offer): nothing like getting a deal from amazon on these latest generation products.,0
(Nope): Seems be to be well worth price so far only had a few days.,0
"(Great laptop): Over all oowww awesome power laptop for this price. this is my stock trading laptop 16gb/512gb ssd very fast!!! lightweight and thin, for me the down side is flat keyboard not use to it yet and wish the battery last longer.",0
(Not wireless printer friendly): I don't like the fact it is hard to hook up to my wireless printer. I'm still not hooked up to my printer.,0
One thing that disappointed me is that in Windows Power Options there is no way to change to high performance.,0
"(Wrong product to title): I've only been at this a couple days on this value laptop, so I will update if it gets any better. The description states a 2.5ghz processor, it is a 1.6 as stated by another review. Of the 32gb you actually only get about 2 to even try to use. That makes it very hard to update just what is needed to keep windows running properly. I had to delete all the games they sent on it. Had to do a reset because I kept getting an error on windows updates. If this was a chromebook, it would work better as intended. Windows 10 is too large a program for a 32gb. We will see how things go, but not thinking it is a keeper. Especially if they are not sending what is described.",0
THE EIGHT HOUR BATTERY LIFE IS SUPER,0
"(Surprisingly good - it makes me wonder how much better those $4000 could actually be): I know MSI haven't been in the gaming computer business that long, but they have a great reputation as a motherboard manufacturer, so based on that, I decided to try them out. I'm glad I did. I've been surprised at how very, very good this laptop is.Graphics - the RTX 3070 handles Cyberpunk (ray tracing off) at a consistent 75 fps, FFXIV on maximum settings runs at 140+ fps, GTA V on maximum settings runs at 80+ fps, Witcher 3 runs at 90+ fps, etc. all on max/ultra settings.Processor - I haven't run into anything that's slowed it down yet.RAM - 16GB has been fine. I haven't run into any need for more based on the games I play.Storage - the 512 GB turned out to be a little small for my needs, so I had to add a WD Black SSD and swap that to my main drive, though it's not MSI's fault that I didn't buy a big enough drive.Monitor - Has great blacks and contrast, but no touchscreen. I don't care about that, though.Build - the shell is made of a sort of brittle plastic that cracked with I was peeling the bottom off to add the new hard drive. Don't expect it to survive a drop.Battery - I honestly don't know. I wanted a laptop because I have a home base with a monitor and keyboard, but I also need to move from desk to desk where I always have a power supply. I rarely need to use it on the go, per se. I've read it can be low, though.So, based on my needs, I'm super happy with how this laptop performs. If you really wanted to spend an extra $2000+ to push those FPS into the 200+ range, I guess you could, but I don't really see the need. Very strongly recommended!",0
(Enamorado): Es perfecta!,0
(Laejor compra): Mi mejor compra,0
"(Came with Defective USB Ports, Details Below): Any USB device we plug into this thing won't so much as power on. At first, we proceeded to make sure that everything was up to date. We started with the USB drivers, then we went onto the support page for this model and updated the chipset and all other recommended drivers. We then confirmed that the BIOS was already up to date and even updated Windows 10 to its latest build.After all that, the problem still persisted. We checked our USB devices by trying them in 2 other laptops...they were working, no surprise there. We spent a few more hours researching the issue online and double checked that we did everything we could, including adjusting the relevant power management settings in Windows, but still nothing.We consider having functioning USB ports a big deal on this model, since it doesn't come with all that much storage, and you would likely want to use a USB device at some point when you're on the go. All in all, we had to spend 5 hours of our time just to confirm that the manufacturer sent us a defective unit.We're not even going to try and wrestle with ASUS and their customer support this time around. We've had a number of ASUS products fail in recent times and have never once gotten them to accept any kind of responsibility. We have always been patient and polite with their customer support, but they seem adamant in not wanting to fix or replace their products.From our interactions with them, it was also clear that the agents weren't reading through our support tickets properly, often resulting in long, drawn out conversations where we would have to ask them the same question over again, so that they could notice days later and eventually conclude that they can't do anything to help.It does sting a bit that we are loyal ASUS customers, easily having spent thousands of dollars on their products over the years, and right now, having that count for nothing. We definitely cannot recommend buying their stuff if that's how they treat customers, especially when the problem is with their product to begin with.",0
(great): love it !!,0
"(MSI GL65 Leopard 10SFK-062): I bought this laptop because it has great reviews and a great price point for the specs. MSI has a great reputation in the gaming realm so that further pushed my purchase.In my short time (5 days) with it here are my initial thoughts:My primary uses will be for gaming, web surfing, and drawing using a Wacom tablet.The startup is fast at least in comparison to my nearly 10-year-old Dell XPS desktop. Less than 20 seconds.Web surfing so far has been speedy as expected. I've had the wifi drop a few times and had to disconnect/reconnect but that may have been my internet and hopefully not the wifi card.I'll be honest I haven't yet been able to download and play a graphically demanding AAA game yet to test FPS, cooling etc. but the other reviews tell me that everything should run smoothly on ultra settings.Speakers: hearable but very hollow sounding, one of the few cons for me. However, I have a Bluetooth speaker and wired headphones that I've tested and the output sound is great.Body: Very appealing rugged/sharp looking body that gets greasy easy. Easily wipes clean but whom am I kidding I bought this beast for what's on the inside. The underside has plenty of room for ventilation. Web surfing and playing Hearthstone(no I didn't buy this just to play Hearthstone lol) hasn't ramped up the fans. USB ports are nice and tight. I wish the power outlet was on the back but hasn't been too much of a bother on the side.Screen: Nice and bright. I don't plan to use it outside so I haven't taken it out to compare in the sunlight. In my house, I actually use it at just above half brightness. Good viewing angles, no dark corners, no dead pixels, and good color. Haven't noticed any tearing. The screen hinges are very nice and hold tight almost all the way shut.The webcam is 720p and is not great but OK. I don't plan to use it much anyway.The Dragon center is pretty cool. Messing with the Per-key RGB Steelseries keyboard lights is fun. The battery dies fairly quickly even just web browsing and playing Hearthstone but that's expected in today's gaming laptops. Stay near an outlet and you'll be fine. The good thing is you can adjust battery and power-saving settings pretty easily.I wish it had a 1TB SSD instead of 512GB, I'd have spent the extra $, and better speakers but apparently you can expand storage and RAM on this so that's good.Overall, so far I would recommend this laptop to others, I already have actually. After I do some more heavy gaming and spend more time with it I'll update this review. I'm glad I got it before they sold out.",0
(Item missing): Even it didn’t arrived and item is missing. They help me to refund the item. I really like this laptop I’m definitely buy this one next time.,0
"(Good graphics, long battery life,quick start up): Email, shopping, stresming",0
"(Laptop Asus muy buena en rendimiento y calidad): Excelente producto y muy bonito color me gustó mucho en especial el teclado Retroiluminado, el portátil rinde perfectamente por los 8Gb de ram y su SSD M.2 recomendado",0
The resolution is almost overkill for a screen this size,0
(it does not have touchscreen): Nice laptop but does not have touchscreen that I thought it had.,0
"(Básica pero sin ñ): De batalla,hubiera estado perfecto tuviera la letra ñ,pero de ahí en fuera cumple con las expectativas.No decepciona la marca.",0
(Ideal computer if windows would work.): Windows 10 is not working,0
"(Insanely great value on a new M1 Air): This M1 replaces a 2015 MacBook Air. It's actually the second M1 Air in our family (I bought a refurbished one earlier this year to replace a retiring 2012 Air), and at $799 for the 8 GB RAM / 256 GB SSD model is an insanely great value.Some of the other recent reviews mentioned a musty odor and speculated these had been in storage or previously used. There was a slight musty or chemical odor when the box was opened, but upon checking carefully I found the smell originated from the included printed materials, NOT the computer itself or the packaging. There was absolutely no sign of mold, moisture, or dampness in the box, the sealed packaging, or the laptop.Installing and running a utility showed this Air was assembled in August 2022 and had so far logged no battery cycles. It's a new M1 Air, not old stock. (The 2020 date in the description is the year the M1 Air model was introduced, not when this computer was made.)",0
"(Stays charged all day): I had a mac desktop for 8 years and it crashed. I had to get something inexpensive fast, so I bought this one. I absolutely love it.",0
"(Amazing Laptop for the price): Full transparency I have had this laptop a total of 2 1/2 days so time will tell if it continues to be a 5 star laptop. So far I really like this computer, the screen and keyboard are both really great. That said if you are buying this for the built in speakers, look elsewhere they are not very good, just wear headphones... really. Like another reviewer, I have been searching for a few months now for a good value gaming laptop. The fact that this has at 2070 and a 10th gen i7 makes me very happy. I could not find another laptop with these specs at this price.",0
"(Great everything, except the battery.): This is a quality built laptop. The keyboard feels really smooth and the screen looks incredibly sharp. I was a little disappointed and the battery life but the specs and overall performance does not disappoint. To get a little further into it, I went ahead with a five star rating because overall power and performance is what I was after, not battery life. Expecting one of the more powerful laptops to have a crazy long battery life is a bit unreasonable. Having said that, the battery life did seem a little shorter than expected. This really isn't the end of the world considering I stay plugged in most of the time anyway.",0
(Amazing value and power): This met my every expectation.,0
(Always there for a quick look up.): Love it because my laptop had a virus on it.,0
"(It looks great and is as quick but the 14"" MacBook Pro is the better buy): The good: very speedy, silent, the midnight color is beautiful (more like a dark gray).The bad or not great:The display is just odd, I can't stand the ugly notch, it's a distraction and doesn't even offer Face ID! Windows laptops have had that for many years now, without a big ugly cut out that feels like it is spying on you with no manual privacy lid (like ThinkPads have for example). Also it is too glossy and reflective, would much prefer a matte anti-glare screen option. The display resolution quality is great, but not as great as the 14"" MacBook Pro.The keyboard is OK but shallower than the 14"" MacBook Pro. It feels like I am bottoming out when typing with my natural amount of pressure.The speakers/sound are also just OK. Definitely not as good as the MacBook Pro's speakers which have a better system like up/front speakers, this one sounds like they are only coming from the bottom of the laptop.The weight is a little heavier than I thought. Honestly it is a negligible difference between the MacBook Pro and Air.I will wait for the 14"" MacBook Pro with the M2 chip and Midnight color.",0
"(Slower than Molasses in January): I absolutely do not recommend. This is slower than my 2014 HP laptop I bought for 400 dollars. I bought this because it had a big screen and looked like it would be decently quick to run simple programs, like a word processor.",0
"(Can't install Linux): This one sucks! There is no way to install Linux on it. Disabled Secure Boot, disabled fast boot, and even manually change the boot option in BIOS. Still won't boot from Linux Mint 20 USB stick. My other laptops, including even several ASUS from a couple of years ago, had no problem in booting into LInux from the same stick. So disappointed that ASUS even design such things that only work with Windows. Time to return and move on to something else ...",0
(Great Laptop in mid-range): Prompt delivery matching description. Quality keyboard and monitor.,0
"(An Outstanding Samsung Chromebook at only $169!!): I *LOVE* IT!!I have been using Samsung Chromebooks for 5 years, my 2012 Chromebook was finally hard to charge, but it might have had something to do with having been dropped several times, and still running great, but hard to charge. I put a little paper tape around the charging pin and it charges now.. but felt its days were numbered so got this new Chromebook!*LOVE* the feel and look of it, no complaints at all, Samsung Chromebooks are amazing! I do prefer the 11.6"" to the narrower Samsung Plus or Pro, they have great resolution, but this Samsung Chromebook I just bought was only $169, sold by Amazon, which always means a lot to me. Third party sellers can't be trusted in my 17 years experience as a regular Amazon customer. Go *Prime* whenever you can, and Sold by Amazon, whenever you can! Makes a huge difference in the customer service you'll get, and Amazon's is outstanding!This particular model was just released this in Feb 2017, I ordered another Samsung Chromebook 3 and returned it the same day about a year ago. This is completely different, feels solid, looks great, operates like a great Samsung Chromebook should, and for $169, you just can't go wrong.Highly recommended! (For your basic things.. Chromebooks do not have a CD/DVD drive or some other features of higher end laptops, but I *LOVE them!)",0
"(awesome computer for gaming): Bought this for my gaming laptop. it's awesome. picked it up on sale cause it's pretty pricey but it plays all my games above 60fps, usually more like 90-120. looks great, works flawlessly so far.",0
(Quick delivery great product): No complaints,0
Product arrived damaged directly out of the box.,0
(Good as gaming laptop. If you still have warranty): Mother board died 3 month after warranty. Then you payBut before it was good.,0
"(Won’t turn on shortly after owning it for a year): I ordered this September 15, 2021. About a week ago (October 2022) it wouldn’t turn on anymore. I took it in to have it looked at and was told that a screw came loose and caused damage to the battery and then the motherboard. I am spending over $500 to get it all fixed. It’s ridiculous that I would have this issue a year in.",0
(Computer): Perfect for my teenage son,0
"(FAST): I feel this laptop was well worth the money, very fast and runs every game maxed out at at least 100fps or more.Build quality is top notch. Only con I can really think of with this laptop while using it for a few weeks is the speakers kinda suck and could have been better.",0
"(it’s absolutely perfect, fast): Had a dell, nothing but issues thanks to amazon customer service to help me get into this ASUS, it’s absolutely perfect, fast, and pretty much does it all from a business standpoint, it’s beautiful and very well made aluminum all the way around! Can’t go wrong here! Thanks again amazon customer service!",0
(Great but could be better!): M1 processor performs great. Would rate a 5 if I could run my iPad applications. Limited apps compared to iPhone and iPad. Hopefully this will improve.,0
"(Exposed wires, bad back panel?): I just received the laptop. Unfortunately, it was defective. There are gaps at the bottom of all round the chassis, and some wires are exposed. The bottom panel of the chassis doesn't seem to be the correct part for the model and small. I just requested a replacement. I hope I can update my review with a better score when I get the replacement,=== Update ===I got a replacement. The new one looks okay. At least, there are no big gaps or exposed wires.",0
(Reasonable and works great): Purchased for my 14 y/o son to do schoolwork while on the road for soccer. Very easy to set up (he did it with no assistance) and easy to use. Great value!,0
"(Four Stars): beautiful, light and fast. a great notebook",0
(Four Stars): Nice and great price,0
"(Five Stars): Great laptop so far. Wish it had a 10 ley pad, but its still great.",0
"(Fácil de usar): En relación con la calidad-precio considero que esta muy bien, es muy fácil de usar y hasta cierto punto intuitivo",0
"(Love it!): Very fast page load and downloads. Frequent Google updates. Unfortunately, cannot download some programs like Turbo Tax; and, I wish it had a DVD slot.",0
(AMAZING.. EXCELLENT!!): Excellent.. better than expected.. very powerful machine.. happy and satisfied!!,0
"(Great laptop.....as advertised.): I bought 2 of these for my kids and they are great. Fast for normal games, great for school work, and great for videos. Seller shipped quickly and these were brand new. Still sealed in the box. I did add 8g more Ram but have not had any issues at all....very happy with this laptop!",0
(Nice little laptop with poor camera): I love everything about this laptop except for the camera. I purchased the laptop for video conferencing while working from home and the camera picture is grainy and blurry because it's only a 480p. I wish I would have noticed that before I ordered it. If you don't need it for the camera then it's a nice laptop. Going to purchase a different laptop with a 1080p camera and use this one for something else.,0
"(Fast and beautiful screen): I got the 14"" i7 16gb 512ssd and has beautiful screen and super fast. The touchpad is like a smartphone but i just turned it off to use cursor. Downgraded from 90ghtz to 60ghtz for more battery but its still fast and smooth browsing. Overall nice laptop for 1200. I didnt buy for gaming but for my new job as realtor. Office use. Will buy a 27"" display later. Lots of ports to connect anything and has a webcam.",0
"(Perfect for gaming and hard work): PROS:* it's pretty light if you don't need the charger (the charger is soo big)* Perfect for gaming* Perfect for VR games* Beautiful pack of color for keyboard and downside y cornersCONS:* Doesnt have camera* Very high temperatures when you are gamingI can play games like warzone 2, fornite, GTA V with 90 FPS more or less, but you need stay attend to change the profile for gaming and use the max potence of the fan coolers for control the temperature, i saw the proccesor in 90° when i played in VR using a ""optimized profile"", i recommend use the ""turbo profile"" if you want to use this computer for gaming, and if you can, use this laptop with aditional ventilation",0
"(Great performer with decent build and a good panel.): I am a professional architectural photographer and videographer who needs a powerful enough laptop for when I am on the road. Additionally, I need adequate color accuracy, which so many laptops don't offer. I took a risk on this one and am happy to say that, though this is not a wide gamut panel, 100% of sRGB is covered, according to my Spyder 5. I edit on wide gamut 2K monitors in my home studio, but for the road, sRGB is fine. And it's a decent looking matte finish panel. My older laptop had a 4K wide gamut panel, which is superior...but this Sager is absolutely adequate, even at only 1080p.I decided to upgrade recently and was looking hard at Ryzen, which to be honest, I would have preferred to Intel. Unfortunately there's not yet enough OEM support and availability, so I decided to pull the trigger on this machine, which I consider an excellent deal at $1,500, especially with the ability to pop another NVMe SSD in there. And anyway, Intel still does fine with Photoshop...even better slightly better in some ways than one of the better Ryzens. This machine is a big step up from my four year old i7-6700h with 16gb of RAM. With 32gb of RAM and a pretty fast processor, I am not worried about editing video either.Reading some reviews, I was worried about the thermal performance of this machine. To see how it does for what I need, I ran PugetBench for Photoshop on it today, just after receiving it. As you can see, the benchmark spiked the first three cores to 92/3c or just over, but never for more than a second or two. The laptop never felt exceedingly hot...and, in my everyday use, I will rarely if ever push it that hard. For gaming I cannot say...it could be an issue. I just have no way of knowing. (By the way, I ran the benchmark with the laptop flat on a wood table in a room at about 79f.) Take a look at the most recent results and you'll see that this laptop did very well against similar machines.The build quality is adequate. It's a simple design that that does not look too much like a gaming machine...and I think it's pretty appealing in appearance. It feels a little plastic...but still solid. The track pad is better than on my old laptop, but I generally use a mouse and Wacom so the trackpad is not too important. The keyboard feels decent and the backlight is good. This appears to be a clean Windows install and there's no bloatware I have encountered.All in all, I give this machine five stars. If the build quality were just a bit better, I'd say a resounding five stars. This laptop is a bargain at $1,500...just great bang for the buck. Thanks, Sager. I am very happy with this purchase.",0
The touch screen works flawlessly and the keyboard is comfortable and responsive.,0
(Arrived on time): Arrived when promised. Purchased as gift. Daughter was happy with it,0
(You pulled a fast one on me.): MISLEADING DESCRIPTION OF ITEM!!!The description of this laptop is not for the laptop they are actually selling. This IS NOT a touch screen. There IS NO DVD DRIVE I did not realize that down below the description of this laptop in the features section it explains this is a no touch screen and no dvd drive. Very misleading. Horrible. Only keeping this because I bought it for my daughter for Xmas and I don’t have time to try to return it and get another one before Xmas. Thanks for the headache.,0
"(Great for productivity and gaming!): The laptop is great. It has beautiful aesthetics. Very fast and the graphics are great. The temps while gaming (Warzone, Doom Eternal) were high at first around the 90-degree C mark. I simply set the maximum CPU power to 98% through the control panel and now I play at around 60-65 degrees Celcius in high settings. It will work great for school although my battery is having trouble giving me accurate readings on how much life I have left. I think its safe to say power saver mode gets you 3 and a half to 4 hours of battery life. This is a small issue given that I am plugged in most of the time. I recommend this product and will be using it for college as well as video editing hobbies and gaming. USB port placement isn't the best but with this deal, I can work with a few minor quirks. IPS display is beautiful by the way!",0
"no matter how I tried, I could not get it to power up",0
"(Slow, but probably good for movie-watching): We needed a cheap laptop to do Gmail and Google Docs only. We bought this in September 2019. The screen is large and bright, and the sound is outstanding, but there is a painful delay when interacting with Gmail and Google Docs, even if only one tab is open in Chrome. Compared to the Windows 7 laptop we bought for about $300 back in 2011, it boots quickly of course, but is noticeably slower once you are in Gmail. Some browser tweaking didn't make any noticeable improvement.",0
"(Battery DoA): For the price and the specs, you would expect LG to properly check that all of the components work as expected. Well I can tell you from first hand experience that it seems like they don't. The laptop is light, and when the battery has charge, it does work as expected, but unfortunately the battery does not keep a charge, and after the battery ran out, that was it for the laptop. Shame on LG for not doing their work right. I guess I won't be buying LG ever again.",0
(Four Stars): Works great,0
(Four Stars): So far so good,0
Quite a bit of bloatware included,0
"(First timer “pc gamer”): This is such a great gaming laptop, first timer “pc gamer” for me. Red dead looks great on this, pixels are amazing. I’m so happy. Thank you so much.",0
"(Buena opción calidad precio): Es una laptop de plástico sin embargo no se siente nada mal al tacto el teclado no es tan bueno pero es pasable, tiene poco almacenamiento, para los juegos competitivos esta bien pero si quieres jugar los de nueva generación no creo que sea la mejor opción, para emular Wii u está bastante bien pude corre Zelda Botw a 30 fps a 720p. Los programas cono matlab, SQL server, NetBeans y los productos de Office corren bien y fluidos a pesar de tener muchas ventanas abiertas . En general es bastante buena opción para un estudiante de ingeniería en sistemas con posibilidad de jugar algunos títulos a buena resolución.",0
"(Very fast!): Very fast!The laptop works great, and everything loads super fast. 10/10 would recommend",0
the slow response rate was noticeable,0
(Good buy): So far so good cannot get the touch screen to work have to use touch pad but it works perfectly otherwise,0
(nice laptop): easy to set up,0
(Best bang for the money): For my first gaming computer I'm absolutley blown away! Everything works flawlessly I use everyday on average for about 4 hours I did add the Samsung evo870 ssd 1tb to the empty space next to the battery and that made it even better I have had this Acer for about a month now and still no problems,0
(It's great laptop but not as fast thought it would be): It's great laptop but not as fast thought it would be. Multitasking on laptop seem too much for the computer sometimes. But overall performance is great.,0
"(Fast, and reasonably priced): The specifications of this laptop are very well considered. There is enough memory, enough SSD space, and a big, bright glorious screen. The power supply is rather large, but is thin for easier packing. The only downside I can see is runtime when it is not powered and is running just on battery is limited, but if you will be leaving it plugged in most of the time, this shouldn’t be an issue. The keyboard is nice, too, and is full-sized, which is rare on a laptop. Recommended.",0
"(Rendimiento de primera a un precio aceptable): La construcción de la laptop es muy buena, me encanta la tapa en aluminio.El rendimiento es bueno para el precio y al tener un ssd va que vuela, por el precio te da una laptop para la escuela y trabajos de ofimática sin ningún problema. Recomiendo a?adir memoria Ram para trabajo un poco más pesado y almacenamiento en caso de ser necesario.La batería es muy duradera.Cazarla cuando esté a precio bajo y será una excelente compra",0
"(Love this laptop): I'm a fortysomething female who is sick of lugging heavy things around, including laptops. I did a lot of research before purchasing this machine. It came down to this one versus the HP Spectre 360. I ended up going with this one because it was slightly less expensive. I've owned it nearly a year now and I have no regrets. It powers up incredibly quickly, the battery lasts a good long while - I'd say 6 to 8 hours online or doing power point. It's extremely lightweight, which I love. I bought a minimalist case for it and when I wear it across my body, I sometimes forget I'm wearing it. I haven't had any problems with the machine overheating or the fan being loud. The only design issue I'd flag is that the screen doesn't bend as far back as I'd like it to. More noticeable if I'm using my machine on the subway and need a bit more distance between me and the screen. Otherwise, no complaints.",0
"(Teclado): lo único, el teclado no tiene ?",0
"(Perfection for the price): This PC is incredible! it is powerful, has a plethora of great features and can do what pcs that are 400-600 dollars more can do...!",0
(Todo funciona muy bien): Ami hijo le encanta mucho para sus video juegos,0
(Quick and easy.): Runs nice and quick. Breeze to set up. This is my first Chromebook. Not a complete replacement for a laptop but good for its purpose. No bloat ware which is nice. I was apprehensive that size would be too small but it is fine. I thought that 4G of RAM might be insufficient but browses fine.,0
"(Good for low intensity use.): It's a good on the go computer. It cannot handle a lot of stuff open at the same time due to low processing power, but it can handle web browsing successfully.",0
"(For the price it's very good computer): It has a nice size screen, battery last long time.",0
(On the actual readable info when viewing this product it said it offers up to 4.3 htrz which if incorrect n misleading): Its a bit flatter than the usual but not as fast as I would expected. HD quality is not what I expected and the mouse keeps flickering.,0
(Buen precio para lo que es): No dice que todo el sistema viene en base inglés pero es un detalle menor que podría ser de esperar,0
"(Worth it): This laptop is, probably the best pc equipment other than a desktop that I have purchased, really reliable, great keyboard that lights up. Have been using it to play my favorite strategy games like age of empires and work at home.",0
"(ASUS for the Win!): UPDATE:: Here we are, over 3 years later and this is still the best laptop I have ever owned. The battery is still solid. No defects or failures in any of the hardware. Works with latest drivers without incident. And, I just noticed last night, the speaker system is still quite impressive even by today's standards.Asus, if you're listening; sell me a new version in a 17"" form factor with 10th gen tech, RAID NVMe, and none of that ""screen pad"" nonsense. Take my money!::ENDUPDATE: After using this laptop for well over a year as my primary dev workstation and gaming device, I can confirm this is very solid. I built an eGPU rig (HP Omen Accelerator/GTX 1070ti) and they work very well together (since the drivers from ~8 months ago). I can play Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 4k, medium settings at ~30-60 fps. 1080p at Max settings is stable at 60+ fps. Most other new games perform similarly.::ENDI have been researching and waiting for a device like this for a long time. The goal was a laptop that could handle heavy software development, medium gaming, has Thunderbolt 3, less than 5 lbs, and gets great battery life. This laptop has/does it all with ease. My primary focus was a solid CPU and decent monitor as my primary use case is software development. I have a MacBook Pro (Late 2016) provided by my job. While it has good CPU power, it's drivers are way behind and do not support everything Windows 10 has to offer. This ASUS has support for all Windows 10 features; specifically, I am interested in the PTP capabilities for easy multi-desktop work. It also is a nice weight at just over 4lbs. There are plenty of reviews out there, so I'll just touch on the differences I count important. The nVidia 1050 Ti GPU is a very nice value add to this already inspired laptop. I can play Portal 2 and Portal Stories with the FPS capped at 60 and the GPU usage averages 38%. I have also tested it's connectivity over its HDMI and USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort and everything works well. My secondary goal was decent mobile gaming with the option dock into an eGPU over Thunderbolt 3. While I have not tested this yet, it has the necessary ports and specs. I will update when I have the full rig built. There is currently (as of v388.13) a bug in the nVidia GPU driver that causes unacceptably high CPU and GPU clock at idle (desktop, no application running). My solution has been to disable the nVidia GPU in Device Manager when I'm not using it. Contrary to some reviews, I like the keyboard on this laptop. Yes, the keys have a bit more travel that other premium options. And yes, they are a bit softer than some. But, I like it this way. They are still fast and responsive. I cannot give this laptop that last start for the following reasons: There is not option, in North America, that I can find to get one without the touchscreen. I don't like them, I don't use them, and I don't want to pay for it. Next, it will not charge off the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports. I understand the power requirements of this device *can* go above the 100w provided by the spec. But, it should be allowed as an option given the user acknowledging the limitations. I say it *can* go above 100w but I have never seen it get even close in all my tests. That's about it. Everything else is great. I consider the ASUS ZenBook Pro, the MacBook Pro for those who want Windows for far less expense.",0
The quality of picture is clear and precise,0
"((Updated 9/17/18) - All-Rounder Sleek Laptop - Defective Luck): (UPDATE 9/17/18) Tested the laptop thoroughly with random gaming, video streaming from Amazon Prime movies while on battery mode. System will completely blank out the screen with no system response unless you hold the power button down. When turning the system back on and log back into Windows, the screen would flicker a lot for maybe 10 seconds then look perfectly fine afterwards. This issue continued at random with the same blank screen issue. Battery had about 50% capacity at the end. House has an ambient temp of 77 degree F with a ceiling fan for the controlled environment. Sad but I will be requesting a return and hopefully a replacement to give this wonderful system class another go. Depending on the QA ethics at ASUS, there might have been no thorough thermal testing and extensive benching before system was packaged for any possible software/hardware defects.(UPDATE 9/14/18) Wife reported that the system has randomly shutdown twice this week while on battery during work. Considering a request for a replacement. Dropping down the level of quality for this product of a brand name with another star drop.(UPDATE 9/11/18) Wife complained that the screen would turn off and had to completely force shutdown to restore. Issue still occurs when on battery mode and power was over 60% charge.Created a Disk Image of current system and started updating majority of the system driversIntel Chipset/Wifi/BTIntel VideoNvidia GPUDisk CleanupWill follow-up later if this helps. Might consider a laptop replacement for a crappy deployment as the initial Windows Logs in the System log files shows a good amount of errors occurring when the instance of the screen turned off for a driver issue of some sort. To lazy to investigate further.(UPDATE 9/7/18) After the 1st week of usage, the system will randomly power down into a sleep state in battery mode. Ran the Asus BIOS Updater and found Version 300 2018/08/21. Initially Version 206 2018/06/21. Tested system in battery mode again with all Office 365 applications opened and Adobe Creative Suite apps such as Acrobat and Illustrator running to replicate what the wife was suffering through when she complained about the sleep/power down issues. System seems stable for now.Was patient for ASUS to refresh their Zenbook Pro as the UX550VE model was nice but it was at it is end of life. Was hoping to find a decent all-rounder laptop with a GTX 1060 that was under 5lbs and around 15"" of screen space but this was fitting the needs properly. After reviewing gaming performance on the GTX 1050 Ti against the 1060, give and take. The UX550GE has a nice body but it will leave evil finger marks on the exterior. The fingerprint reader works nicely for the unlocking Windows and the setup process was straight forward. Please note, since I work in IT as a Desktop Engineer, I seriously hate Win10 with the Cortana features and telemetry crap. ASUS Win10 Image is current 1709 latest release.Played Blizzard Heros of the Storm and Starcraft II. The Intro videos did display some minor distortion on the 4K screen but it held up find for the most part. Have not been able to test 4K movies yet but hoping it will be smooth.Accessories include a microfiber cloth, a spare power velcro tie, Ethernet dongle.Some Notes on the side, I have worked on various Lenovo desktop and laptops, MS Surface Books, Surface 3 and 4, MacBook Pros and they have their Pro/Cons. I must say for the ASUS Zenbook Pro, this laptop series will fair well for good content creation and part-time video gaming.PS: This is for my Wife so I am jealous of her now!",0
(As far as I can tell it’s a well working machine): I bought this for personal use. It filled my needs. The only thing I can’t tell you about is durability and reliability. Stay tuned. Price wasn’t bad.,0
"they are lighter, usually faster, and less glitchy/problematic",0
(Worse Out of the Box than my 4 year old Chromebook at the same Pricepoint): I got this because it was larger and seemed better than my Chromebook I bought in 2016 at the same price ($200.00). This Acer chromebook is so slow compared to my previous one and lags just doing the most basic of things in Google Docs like copying and pasting. The battery life is abysmal and I honestly feel like I bought a 2 year old computer.,0

"(Great laptop): I replaced my 6-year old HP Envy with this newer version and love it. I've had is a few days and am learning about its newer features. The fingerprint reader is great and makes it simpler to log in yet it is more secure in my opinion. My old Envy was also a 17 inch screen version. This laptop is slightly smaller overall but still has the same size screen. It is also lighter that my old one. The ""M.2"" solid state disk is fast and boot time is very quick. I have configured most of the default storage locations to be on the second drive (a regular hard disk). This machine is a great value for the money.",0
I have had some issues with the software it brings (multiple reset requests when updating).,0

Coil Whine is still present even after a month of testing.,0
"(Was excited to have a chromebook. Major flaw was ...): Was excited to have a chromebook. Major flaw was the inability to adjust font size on the screen without making the screen 2x. The fonts on the opening screen and the ip address and tab lines were so tiny you need a magnifying glass. I spent 1 hour with Acer Techs and they were unable to correct. Same with Google. I did get a response on line and the correction to enlarge the fonts made the screen ""landscape"" meaning you had to center all views repeatedly. Sorry Acer, that is to me a glitch I could not live with. Returned it within two days.",0
(W): Useless POS Windows 10 S mode (nanny mode) & you can't disable it. Will only run apps from Microsoft -- couldn't run Canon scanner/printer or allow me to install software for it -- only reason I bought it.,0

Seller not providing support beyond ""You need to reach out to Acer repair"".No contact info, no customer service, no warranty procedure or customer support. Terrible. Product should last longer than 4 months, now I have to ship it for repair which sounds like it could be a month+ turn around.",0

(Five Stars): Great product! Love it,0
"(...that pesky known issue of ""no WI-FI""...): I read the reviews here before I purchased this laptop 8 days ago, including the 'no wifi' reviews; I actually thought that 'I wont get one of those', ...but I did..., and since no one had said that HP has a fix, I was ready to return my laptop to Amazon for a replacement because the laptop itself is great as far as features and performance[so far]. Well, I called Amazon and they got HP Support in on a 3-way call. HP used the HP Support Assistant app on the laptop to diagnose and temp-fix the issue, once I was on wifi, they remotely updated all drivers associated with the wifi issue, and the laptop in general, for a permanent wifi fix, this, all via the wifi connection; and, they are waiting for my update to ensure that the issue is resolved permanently, so for now, I am impressed with the HP laptop and the HP support. I just wish I didnt have a need for the support in the first place. Also, after watching what the tech did remotely, a knowledgeable person who is AWARE of the HP Support Assistant app could troubleshoot and fix the wifi issue themselves as long as they then also go to the HP site and update the laptop wifi and any other recommended out of date drivers; But again, we shouldnt have to do that... last note, I also have a 3 year old HP Envy laptop that I can now hand off to a family member, it has been bulletproof since day one. I hope to do and say the same about this one in 3 years, minus this incident.",0
"(Just Everything): This is generation 6, generation 7 is now out, but speaking of generation 6. It has everything you could want in a business laptop, ports, a mini memory card, excellent screen, bluetooth, Hello fingerprint and face recognition, etc. This is my 3rd Thinkpad, along with other laptops, and I won't be going back to any others, if I ever need another one I'll be going directly to Lenovo or one of their dealers.",0
"(Honestly...): I was hoping to better the workflow within Cinema 4d and DaVinci Resolve with this laptop, and it exceeded all expectations! Although it's at its best when plugged in, I'm more than satisfied with the results. In addition, what I really appreciate, is the screen with its refresh rate and color coverage, as well as the keyboard that looks and feels fantastic. Looking forward to challenging that beast with other real-world tasks, so might update the review.",0
"(This is a major go): This is a great laptop for using heavy size programs like all the programs for adobeIt is very good for Photoshop, But the colors on the laptop itself will be a little bit less vibrant but that doesn’t matter if you export it but for everything else it is a perfect laptop",0
"(Screen failure on two different ZenBook UX units): Purchased the high end unit (i7, 512 GB SSD) - I am a business user and the monitor failed 6 months into ownership - sent back to Asus for over 6 weeks - they replaced it with a refurbished unit that the monitor failed in 5 months - I run MS Office products and am very conscientious on how I shut down, operate, and care for my systems. It is now out of warranty and has been converted to a desktop unit. It failed as the high end laptop I was hoping for - I paid over $1600.00 for the unit. Previous to this, I liked ASUS products now I will never own one again.",0
(DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!): This seller is a scumbag. Computer was freezing over and over while I was trying to set it up. I knew something wasn’t right. I wasted over TWO HOURS trying to get this thing setup. I call dell support and sure enough this laptop is NOT NEW. It was purchased from Best Buy originally over 245 days ago. Even after a google “powerwash” whatever the $@&! lame excuse that is for a reset the laptop was STILL crashing. Screw you Happy Ranger/Oceanus. Buy new tech in a store where you can clearly see it’s new.,0
(It's worth the money): I just recently got this computer it's been good I have not had no problems I've been running everything as smooth as butter the screen looks gorgeous it's worth the money,0
(Love it!): You can't go wrong with this one. Pretty good battery life for a gaming laptop. Over the top performance. Nice screen quality. The 144 hz panel is amazing. It's a bang for your buck!,0
"(Great Laptop Overall): First of all, this laptop is great for gaming. Keyboard and screen is flawless but it has a serious heating issue. But you can solve it with lowering CPU frquency (from power plan) or start cooler boost (it's very loud) and using a headphone. I had the fan clicking sound at fastest fan speeds. It disappeared after I accidentaly spill some water on it(don't try it). Body gets fingerprints very easily and it's annoying. It has a second 2.5 drive space and I installed an SSD. It's hard to open the case but be gentle, feels like it can brake easily. And lastly, it has some pointy edges on it's body, you may get uncomfortable when using it on your lap.",0
I understand that if I'm gaming or using a moderate amount of CPU that the battery life would be terrible,0

If anything get weird with it in the coming weeks once she starts using it regularly, I'll be sure to update.",0

Pero si quiere ser anfitrión y compartir pantalla, necesitas una memoria ram mínimo de 8 yg.Y esta no se puede ampliar el ram.",0
"(Fading Keys, No Touch Screen): No touch screen. Also, the labels on the keys are fading after just a few weeks and I haven't even used it that much.",0
"(Great for Moderate Gaming): I really enjoy this laptop, It's super quick. Loads into windows under 4 seconds.I added a ""Kingston Technology HyperX Impact 8GB 2666MHz DDR4 CL15 260-Pin SODIMM Laptop Memory (HX426S15IB2/8)"" ram module for making the Ram 16GB total, this will work best with the shared GPU memory.YOU WILL NEED MORE RAM FOR HEAVIER GAMESThe onboard GPU memory is shared with your ram when in gaming mode.I played space engineers, which requires around 5GB of VRAM for medium gameplay, it leaked into my actual ram, but with the hyperx upgrade there was only slight FPS drops but not enough to affect gameplay. Ram is important.I recommend windows 10 Pro 1909, don't use 2004 on this laptop will die really quick in Win 10 2004. Lasted about 3 hours under full load, whist 1909 lasted around 7 hours under full load, close to expected battery life.The Intel CPU Turbos to 3.98 Ghz while plugged in, if you set it that way.If you plan to install linux, the NVME will not be detected at boot time, to fix this, head to bios and on the first tab or second tab press ""CTRL"" + ""S"" to bring up a setting and change and disable intel optane firmware to use nvme in linux, as when you boot a non windows OS, the nvme will be placed into sleep mode.As for a extra nvme slot, i picked up ""Western Digital 250GB WD Blue SN550 NVMe Internal SSD - Gen3 x4 PCIe 8Gb/s, M.2 2280, 3D NAND, Up to 2,400 MB/s - WDS250G2B0C"" from many other users, as this will take full advantage of the laptops firmware and hardware. You can pick higher space storage, but as a light gamer, this was enough for me.As for the 2.5"" drive, i picked up a ""ST1000LM024 HN-m101Mbb"" It's a 1TB Mechanical Drive with decent write and read speeds for lighter games, and game storage. Granted it is slower, but for this laptop its perfect and I can get full R/W speeds that were advertised. If you notice, it's the same drive inside the XBox 1 - 1st Gen, so You can game on it as well, not as fast load times, but its fast enough to still enjoy a game.Besides the battery life, this is a really good laptop if you go out to a friends house for a night and do some moderate gaming like a LAN party, or a small road trip, or sitting out side for a few hours.I do not recommend taking this on a flight. Unless you get an extra battery.As of this message, I am using this as my main pc, and quite enjoy it, the Intel i5v9 is great and the GTX 1650 plays most games on Medium/High at 50/60fps.Also another note to stay on 1909, is that windows f--ked up the NVIDIA auto select method for Intel Graphics and GPU graphics, so some games will default to intel CPU instead of NVIDIA.Also, This laptop can play COD: Cold War at High settings with 48/55fps under heavy scenes and a perfect 60fps on normal fighting.",0

(no touch screen but good scroll features): small but nice,0
"(My only criticisms are the 512GB SSD is not enough storage and the immature light up keyboard.): Other than what's in the headline I really don't have criticisms about this laptop.1. RTX 2070 8G - this runs my Dual View Sonics VS17090 at full native resolution. I can work on my left monitor and watch Netflix/Youtube/etc on the right all with no lag/flicker beautifully rendered. I also play an RTS game that has fully rendered projectile physics with barely any simulation slowdown even after 30 minutes of gameplay. When working very hard, the GPU fands become loud. This might annoy some people but it is a sign of good design that cares more about protecting the GPU than being loud.2. CPU i7- 10750H - it does what it's supposed to. I don't find competent CPUs to be incredibly competitive nowadays. GPUs are where it's at.3. Memory and Storage - 16GB - a sufficient amount. Storage - 512GB SSD. This is simply not enough to store all of my family pics and videos and all the other garbage from my old computer. I require at least 1TB and preferably 2. I belive this is upgradable and will be one of the first I perform. SSD is nice though for energy savings, durability, and access speed.4. Input/Output. Touchpad - meh, never been a fan of using a touchpad. It is enough when not using a wireless mouse, which I use whenever possible. The clicks on the 2 touchpad buttons is noticeable but not super annoying. 3 USB ports, ethernet port, mic connection, wifi card, bluetooth. 1 HDMI, 1 mini display port, headphone jack, stereo speakers. Love the dual screen capability! I really don't use the internal speakers but enjoy the bluetooth to my wireless headphones. From my understanding a lot has been made of the internal speakers with this laptop. I was not ""blown out of the water"" but they are more than competant. The keyboard has a good layout, slighly different from standard keyboards found on work computers and my one at home. It takes a tiny bit of adjusting but still easy to use. I disabled the keyboard light up LED system immediately. I doubt his cost much, but I'd prefer to be without it all together. The display is acceptable to me, but I usually connect my ViewSonics, and love them.5. Cost/value. I paid about $1400 including taxes. I found this to be an excellent value. I will probably update this review in a few months. I suspect it will increase to a 5/5.",0
(Pleased so far): Only think I like better on my older Lenovo is that the caps lock and number lock keys light up. I have had an occasional problem with the number pad not working even with lock on in this Sager but otherwise I am pleased with the laptop. I have actually not had time to try it out in a game yet. I have not found anything wrong with it unlike a Dell I bought and immediately returned. This is my 2nd sager and the older one still works great just is outdated. Sager and Lenovo are the only brands that work good for me right out of the box.,0
"(Budget laptop? More like busted laptop.): This advertised fast speed internet and ease of use, neither of those were true. Once I had more than two tabs open the computer it was slower than a granny taking a Sunday drive. Save your money get a decent laptop. This was just one disappointment after another. I really wanted to love it too.",0
(Good quality): Fast and easy to use.,0
(First Mac laptop): Love this computer !,0
"(Laptop): Works great, a good quality product.",0
"(Don't buy this particular one): I bought this for our 9yr old grandson. He needed it for his school work. Twice the LED went out, once completely and had to return it for repairs. Now half the screen is black and have to return it again. I guess I got a defective one originally. It doesn't cost me to ship it back but I t does cost $10 for the box to ship it in",0
(Recommended): Very good. Portable and durable,0
My led keyboard has malfunctioned multiple times and the ROG gaming center is just all over the place.,0
(And it has really good battery life): It's nothing fancy but it does everything that I need it to. And it has really good battery life. It is a great buy for the price.,0
"(Windows response to the Chromebook): This seems to me Windows answer to the Chromebook, but honestly I would just recommend one of Acers Chromebook over this. It comes running Windows S mode out of the box, meaning you can only run apps from the Microsoft store. However, upon set up you do have the option to revert to standard Windows mode, which I did. Not a ton of storage on the thing. Replacing or upgrading the SSD drive is an option, but it is just easier to use a portable drive of your choice, had no problems with a 500GB Samsung via the USB C port. Start up is nice and fast, No SD or micro SD slots, which is kind of a downer for me. Overall, it's a nice choice for work/school from home if you need to be in a Microsoft environment, but is not going to replace an actual full size laptop, and you may be better served just going with a Chromebook.",0
(Complete Trash): Lasted two weeks before it presented with a blue screen error that said Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC. It can't do a system restore because it won't allow you to select the drive (even though it displays it) and you can't even reset the computer because that fails too.,0
"(Battery was useless and I'm forced to use a mouse): The battery didnt even charge, the touch pad or whatever is called, is idiotic and annoying, forced to use a mouse.",0
I put it in my backpack with the power brick and its heavy.,0
"(Poor quality): This laptop is a reasonable price but its still not worth it. I should have sent it back right from the start but thought I would hang in there with it. I am on a 400 mps wifi with a router that supports up to 600 and I am barely squeaking out 120 in the same room as the router. All other laptops (HP) have no issues reaching over 300. It is extremely slow and half the time will not process links even with pop up blocker off. Buy a better machine, I wish I did.",0
(So far so good): Nice came exactly how it was stated delivered in good conditon. Came on time so far so good update in a few weeks,0
"(Slow!! Definitely not recommend): Noisy! Noisy! Noisy!!!! If you wanna buy it, make sure that you are ok with the noise. It becomes noisy after a few minutes working. Color is nice. I don't like the shape of this laptop, the corners are kinda sharp. It's not 1TB, I don't know but I just see about 929.9GB in total. Anyway, I ordered an ASUS laptop and this one is not as noisy as ASUS. I have no idea why they are noisy. Slow!! Definitely not recommend!Update June 30: what annoys me is that the laptop keeps updating a new version which takes too much time and it makes me feel so frustrated to wait every time it updates its system. I think it’s because of the Windows 10 system. So, consider that before buying it. And my wifi is very strong and fast, all the other devices work fast, except for this laptop. I have another laptop which is ACER, it works much faster compared to this LENOVO. The reason why I had to buy it is that 1 of my courses require the program that my Acer laptop cannot download. Lenovo is always noisy!!! Honestly, I'm so mad it the quality!Update August 13: I bought the antivirus software for my laptop and it’s still so slow. No viruses but nothing can help it to be faster.Update Nov 13,2018: it runs slower and I have to delete or transfer a lot of data to my USB. The nice thing about it is cheaper than other laptops. But honestly, for 1TB but you can only use about 10 GB and it runs slowly, super slowly when you download more programs. I don’t think it’s worth the money.",0
(This product does NOT have a Backlit Keyboard.): I love this laptop. That said the offer claims that the computer has a backlit keyboard. IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKLIT KEYBOARD.,0
It does get very hot while gaming.,0

"(Everything we wanted): My husband and I ordered two of these laptops for each of us after doing some research comparing different “budget laptops” available.Honestly, it’s everything we wanted and it’s a major upgrade from our 3-4 year old HP laptops we had earlier. It’s super fast and responsive, and we are able to switch between different applications and tabs seamlessly.The screen display is fine for us and that was our biggest concern from reading the reviews. It’s not as bad as the reviews were making it up to be, especially if you’re just using it for work, emails, browsing, conference calls etc.It’s got a very sleek and modern look, too. We love our laptops so far and would definitely recommend them!",0
(great): I love it!,0
"(Muy linda estéticamente, es rápida y ligera.): El paquete pesó aproximadamente 7 libras, una computadora muy rápida y simpática estéticamente.",0
(Great buy): This laptop is amazing it's a good buy for somebody who wants to get into PC gaming but doesn't necessarily want to put their own PC together yes it's easy to build your own PC for the same price or possibly cheaper but there's a whole lot of headaches that go into that and it's really easy to mess it up so if you want to avoid headaches go straight to gaming this is your option this is your best bet one word of advice though if you don't want the fans to blow like crazy all the time open up nitro sense and select battery saver option for both AC and battery mode I get 200 FPS and rocket league 150 FPS and Counter-Strike very satisfied awesome computer.,0
(Nice and simple.): Great product that is easy to use and has all of the necessities.,0
"(Great Chromebook but......): (Written by the Wife of Aaron J.) I purchased this chromebook July 18, 2018 brand new. This is my third chromebook purchase. I love Chromebooks and I love all of my other Samsung devices, so I thought why not get a Samsung Chromebook. I love everything about it except the fact that each time I update the operating system I start experiencing random restarts which sometimes occur multiple times back to back. Doing a powerwash will sometimes resolve the problem, but most often I have episodes like this until I guess the ""fixer update"" is pushed out. Around 3 or 4 months ago, my chromebook stop connecting to the Google Play Store and I could not download apps that were previously installed on my chromebook before i had to do a powerwash because of the constant restarting. I see that the apps are downloading but they never show on my device. Google Play Store says that the apps are downloaded already but I can not see/access them. I have contact Samsung support multiple times and I am always told to powerwash my chromebook.",0
(Great product): Awesome product thank you,0
"(You should at least check what you ship): Starts up in less than 30 seconds, keyboard doesnt work until 10-15 minutes later",0
Customer service was great,0
"(Better than expected!): I can't complain. Its design, weight, size make it a formidable combination",0
(Get what you pay for. Functional but quirky.): It’s perfect for web based applications. I use a lot of google docs so it’s perfectly functional. Only problem is it occasionally (1-3 times a day during an 8 hour work day) shuts off on its own and then turns back on. I contacted amazon and heard nothing back. I guess that’s what you get for a $200 device.,0
"(Track-pad issues take this machine from a 5 to a 2.): I bought a Samsung Chromebook 11.6 in model in 2012, and it has been amazing. However, after heavy use, it was time to purchase a new one (it still works wonderfully when plugged in, but the battery is dead and I didn't want to invest in a sub-par battery. I intend to use my old Chromebook as a desk-top ""computer"" for my students at work).I thought I would just purchase the latest version of the same brand and size, ordered the Samsung Chromebook 3, and eagerly awaited the machine, knowing that set up would be a snap and that all of my bookmarks, documents, and etc. would follow when I booted up the new version. This was all as expected, but I am not a happy customer. Why? Because the trackpad on this model when two finger scrolling is atrocious! It doesn't register my fingers, or if it does, lags and stutters. None of this happened/happens with my old Samsung Chromebook--it's as snappy and responsive as the first day I plugged it in. I thought it might just be that the particular Chromebook I received had a problem, and I even contacted Samsung and chatted online with a service representative who told me it was a hardware issue and I should return it or send it in for servicing. As I had owned it all of 10 hours, I returned it to Amazon and ordered a new one. Sadly, this machine is even more glitchy than the first! Is anyone else having this problem? I am so frustrated and disappointed, since I am very happy with every other aspect of the new model. This problem, however, makes the Chromebook virtually unusable. I am not interested in carrying around a mouse, so that isn't a fix--The track-pad should WORK!! Grrr!Has anyone else had this problem? Is there a solution? Is the brand new Flagship model 3 (released two days after I ordered mine) any better?",0
"The touch screen was very responsive, even with the protective screen film still on.",0
"(Best gamer Laptop, 5 STARS): Happy with my Lenovo Legion 5, excellent speed, High quality graphics in games, I can upgrade the memory to 32GB and install another 1TB SSD, the super fast RTX 3050TI with 4GB DDR6, the integrated graphics are not so bad 2GB uses the system for less demanding tasks, led light on the keyboard, fixed use for hours of the night, RECOMMENDED.",0
"Chat support will put you on hold for ""2-3 minutes"" (but it's actually much longer) and then it AUTOMATICALLY DISCONNECTS you if you haven't typed in anything for 5 minutes.",0
"It is sleek, light and looks great.",0
(Speedy processor cheap hardware): The screen on this seems like really cheap plastic. The processor on this does work quickly though. The hardware on this computer is really cheap. I worry it just isn’t going to last.,0
"(Best for the basics (great for beginners)): Years later and this little guy is still going strong. I am not an advanced tech person but this is perfect for the basics, plus with access to of all of the google play store. Perfect if you are basically looking for a stepped up version of your phone (mostly browsing, streaming, social or basic office use).It’s flexible to the needs of everyone on the family. I have always though it would be great for middle-aged folks who need a very user-friendly interface and not too many options. But the screen is not huge so if vision is a concern, opt bigger.Also hugely beneficial to have the easy compatibility with my phone for sharing through google drive or photos (way easier than any other cloud service.) Great for EASILY sharing family photos with the grandkids.The only fault I’ve ever found is the speakers don’t have a huge range, so if you’re anticipating a lot of Netflix bingeing get a USB plug-in speaker.And regarding gaming, this is not your best bet. Does not have the power for any big games.I’ve never had any trouble with the OS, screen, camera, ports, or keyboard. Everything works like a charm and I look forward to getting an updated version, if this one ever conks out on me in the years ahead .",0
(Five Stars): This computer is well worth the money you pay period,0
(Don’t buy!): Really slow and closed out the internet everyone I was using it...,0
"(Great): Works perfectly, love it.",0
(dead in two years): worked great but 2 years later it is dead. i wish it would have lasted longer.,0
(waste of money!! beware!!!): Very slow laptop. Hardly used for only 2 years and is now completely dead!! read the forums this is VERY COMMON!! total piece of junk I will never buy lenovo again!!!,0
(Laptop): It's a hp product,0
"(Good basic laptop): This laptop is super lightweight. Keys press easily and quietly. It's features such as the lighted keyboard with the ability to dim that light are perfect.It handles basic tasks without complaint, such as email, youtube, having several browser windows open.The battery is okay; will go for about 3-4 hours before getting low. Unless you put on the keyboard back lighting- that seems to significantly reduce the battery life to 2-3 hours.Has no touch screen.Overall worth the price for a basic laptop.",0
"(Great Product for a Great Price): I got the 64 GB RAM, 4 TB NVMe drive space model, and the price I got it for was absolutely phenomenal ($2600). I would think specs like this would usually price a laptop up near the $4000-$5000 range. So far, the laptop has been great. The only things that bug me are the battery life, which will only get you 2-3 hours on windows battery saver mode during normal usage (without gaming). Also, the laptop is very fingerprint prone. Other than that, the laptop has been great! What an awesome product!Edit: Changed this review to 5 stars because everything still seems to be working super well!",0
(Good): For now excellent,0
"(NO COMPREN ESTE ARTICULO ES UNA ESTAFA PUBLICIDAD ENGA?OSA): Super molesta con este equipo, las especificacionen no cumplen con lo que sale. Primero dice que es teclado iluminado.

A refurbished version of this computer is 600$. before this i really loved the computer so it's a shame.",0

"(Amazingly fast but a little heavy): This is replacing a 11 inch air that I spilled a beer on. I pretty much love everything about it except the bigger size and heavier weight. Battery life is amazing. Speed, still hard to get used to.I loved the smaller size though.",0
"(Great for College): This computer is lightweight, easy to carry around, and does everything I need. I can listen to lectures and download word unlike the Chromebook I got from Asus. The speed is great as well. I wish I would have bought it sooner.",0
"(Computer shipped with a broke screen.): Ordered this computer and was very excited to receive it. As soon as I opened it up and powered it on, I discovered a broken screen. There was a large red line that ran up and down on the right portion of the screen and a chip in the bottom portion of the screen. Very unhappy to receive a damaged product. Sent it back and ordered a new one. Has anyone else had this same issue?",0
The SteeSseries keyboard is a nice touch and has the perfect amount of keytravel for my preference along with individual RGB customization lights.,0
"(Purchased for teen): This computer is used daily for a teen for looking things up, videos, and google searches.",0
"(Love it): I've had this computer for about 6 weeks now. My old computer was 8+ years old so this is definitely an upgrade. The screen is nice, crisp and clean. It's fast, much faster than my older one. It took me maybe an hour to get all my stuff moved over from my back-up, probably not even that long. It was ready to go out of the box, pretty easy set-up. The fingerprint thing is cool but only works about 75% of the time (mostly iffy if I just washed my hands or put lotion on so maybe understandable in some cases). The price was OK but it dropped nearly $100 3 days after I purchased my computer (now it's back up again). The hard drive isn't huge so I have to put all my movies and stuff on an external hard drive, which is fine for me but something to keep in mind. It works great for me for daily use and watching Netflix. It's nicely slim and lightweight if you need to trek it around. It stays nice and cool after use. Definitely recommend.Edit: A couple years later and I took off one star. The screen separated from the plastic thing that attaches it to the keyboard base on the right side. I opened the laptop and the screen just pulled away. About 2-3 inches total pulled back. I was able to fix it with a lot of patience and super glue (lol) but it was only 2 years old. Could be the way I opened the laptop or bad luck but still annoying. The screen itself still worked fine but now I'm scared to close it. So I rarely close the lid which works out for me since I don't take it anywhere very often but still.Edit: I took off another star. The touchpad is peeling and now it's hard to control the cursor. It'll randomly stop working or become unresponsive. I've purchased laptops that last much longer than this one so I'm disappointed. It's only 2 years old and I basically use it like a desktop.",0
"(laptop for the slow at heart): Maybe it's because I made the mistake of buying it used, maybe this laptop isn't efficient but 12 GB of Ram and a Quad Core i-5 processor do not seem to mean anything. Slow, lagging, terrible laptop. I do not recommend.",0
"(Great deal for the money): This is a great computer great for multi-tasking. I am very pleased, thank you!",0
(Equipo dell): Me encanta el producto muy practico muy versatil ademas muy facil de usar simplemente puedo decir que esta exelente el producto,0
"(Meh): It's good for puttering around the internet, if it's plugged in.",0
(GRANDAUGHTER LOVES IT!): THIS LAPTOP FITS HER PERFECTLY - NOT TO BIG AND EASY TO CARRY!,0
(Easy to add memory and another harddrive.): Easy to upgrade!,0
"(Problems after Windows Updates): I set up the finger print login and didn't note my typed password. Shortly after a required major system upgrade, the finger print login was erased and not remembering my typed password, I ended having to reset the laptop. Took me a week of research and trial and error before I was able to login. Then I found this upgrade had locked screen brightness at full. I don't recall how I got around that but it took about a week again of research. Everything else is so far fine but I didn't realize I was purchasing major hassles after these upgrades.",0
A wearble device with windows hello enabled fingerprint recognition to serve as an alternative to traditional keys,1
(Basic internet usage): Perfect for internet usage but that’s about it.,0
(Not Good for Gaming or General Use): For the price this product looks like it has great value but I wouldn't recommend it. With just general use the computer became scorching hot. Using any application that used the graphics card made the computer too hat to touch on the bottom and the keyboard was barely usable because it felt like your fingers were in an oven.,0
(bad ass laptop!): We bought this for my wife so she could do some video editing and also for schooling. The laptop is blazing fast at all things. The only cons were the screen just like everyone says. But to have performance you must sacrifice some visual. It just really depends on the person and takes some getting used too,0
"(Decent small laptop - a tad bit slow): I was looking for a small laptop to use on campus when I don’t have access to my home desktop. This fits my needs pretty well. The only problem I have is that run speed is much slower than my desktop. It isn’t unbearably slow, but I may have to upgrade the ram to speed it up. Otherwise it types well and is very lightweight and portable.",0
"(High price, poor quality): Had the computer for 3 months and motherboard is out. What a mess. Now the process to get an exchange.",0
"(Amazing overall great chromebook!): I love this product of my new chromebook, this is my first chromebook but love it already and all it's features. Very fast, clean, easy to use an overall a great item to have or even a must have for anyone wanting a light fast laptop on the go or at home. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and not problems at all with it at all nothing is wrong with it. Thanks Amazon and deal arc!",0

(Battery life is a bust): I’m enjoying this laptop but the battery life is the worst of any tablet or laptop I’ve ever owned.,0
"(Great starter Chromebook.): This device works excellently as a lite notebook with Google Doc integration. The battery life is good as well as screen quality. As a Chrome OS, it does not offer a great deal of Bluetooth devices. It integrates with my Smartphone and USB. It does not offer any touchscreen capability.",0
"(Amazing Laptop): This laptop is amazing! Very portable and powerful. No issues with it at all. I've been using it for Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier Pro and After Effects. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a powerful, thin and lightweight laptop.",0

"(Do not buy!): Bought this for school about 5 months ago and I’m already having issues with it. The WiFi card crapped out or something where it doesn’t pick up any available networks. I’ve tried multiple things to fix it including update the driver, uninstalling , re-installing the driver but nothing has worked. I’ve spent so many hours through countless YouTube videos and forums. But I haven’t had any luck. The HP forums offer absolutely no useful information at all. This is just not worth the headaches. Invest in something better.",0
"(Very good size for a teen. No problems with antivirus.): Bought for my daughter as Christmas present. She needed a wireless device to help do her work, read, and do research on the internet. No complaints so far!",0
"(Nice): It is nice and good , it just runs slow so cant enjoy it because of it other than that is good.",0
(Best $700 laptop): Amazing FPS it runs so beautiful. One down side is smalls storage but makes it fun to buy a bigger ssd and do cool customization,0
(Works fine.): Dells are always decent.,0
"(Where is the support?): when I turned it on and signed in I could not make a desktop icon. Not a big deal, but there was no information on the internet on how to fix it besides making a custom shortcut. But in doing so you don't get the icon. so instead of making a custom icon for something i bought brand new I contacted support. it took me almost an hour to actually talk to a person, it took the person 12 minutes to before they actually gave me half a response related to my issue. They stated that it was a software issue and I needed to contact their SmartFriend support. You need to pay for that service. So the brand new laptop i had just opened without installing anything on it had a software problem they wouldn't try and resolve without me paying for help. This is a great brand and business.",0
"(Not for all around use): GOOD: This laptop is a beast! A great entry level gaming laptop. It's a thrill to have the AMD Ryzen 7 processor, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB solid state HD. Laptop construction feels solid, and so far no mechanical or software issues. Windows 10 Home setup default, with very minimal bloatware included. Very fast boot time. In general this equipment takes very little time to get used to.MEH: While the Lenovo Legion 5 may be a great entry level gaming machine, I would NOT recommend this laptop for daily use.For one thing, this device costs about $200 more than equivalent non-gaming laptops, including several models from Lenovo. It seems to be only the processor and video quality that you are paying extra for. If you want a laptop for something other than gaming, there are other options.The power cord is an unusual proprietary 230W brick. And you had better buy a second one, because this laptop is not compatible with any docking station that will power the laptop. Yes, you can hook up a USB-C generic docking station, but you'll still need to also plug into your power cord. And by the way, that extra power cord will set you back at least $76. (This is not an expense you'd have to pay if you purchase a laptop that powers by USB-C. I really wish I had considered this.)MISC: As mentioned, the construction of this laptop is solid, and that includes the keyboard and palm rest. But overall this shell seems particularly attractive to dust and smudges. If you plan to travel with your new Legion 5 laptop, be sure to bring some dust cloths.And you may not want to travel with this beast, as it's quite heavy.OVERALL: I wish I had done more research before buying this laptop. It's solid, and should perform well. But also limited for daily use. I'm particularly disappointed at the expensive proprietary charging cable and the lack of a compatible docking station.",0
"Strong build, only the screen is a little bit too flexible for me but just when you ""play"" with it",0
"(Fast prossessing speeds, lightweight): This laptop has pretty much everything I was looking for. It boots up very quickly, processes quickly, and it lightweight. The battery life is pretty great. My only issue is with the touchpad. It can be sensitive and aggravating sometimes, probably because the left and right-click buttons are part of the touchpad.",0
"(Machine is good, warranty policy and support is not): Laptop is a nice machine, but be aware:Support is not good (I mean repair). Also if you change anything (like upgrading the RAM or storage) Asus USA will refuse to repair. Even if the faulty part is not connected to the upgraded component. They demand to have the EXACT machine back, otherwise no warranty (nada).So anyone who is considering any modification should think about twice.",0

Not problems yet and I will problem I will report.",0

Not Lenovo and definitely not this!",0

"(decided to return the same day i opened the box): My first review was to return it but since it was good for value, I decided to keep it. However the laptop is heating a lot, I fear it will burn out because the CPU temperatures go quite high and very noisy. The cooling is not enough, you can't even touch the upper side of the keyboard because of heat. I fear it might malfunction soon because of melting of some pieces inside. I just play total war by the way so it's not super high graphic needs, if I play a FPS I think the computer will burn. So, overall good speed and graphics but bad sound, bad keyboard lights and extremely bad cooling.",0

"(What a laptop, killer performance with beautiful display): I initially planned on purchasing the Alienware m15 as I have bought gaming computers from Alienware for the last 15 years. However, after dealing with the worse customer service I ever experianced I decided to spend my money with another company and said goodbye to Dell.I ended up between the Razor Blade 15 and the MSI GS 65. One of the things that stood out to me was that even though many of the professional reviews ranked the Razor Blade as the better laptop many of them mentioned the GS 65 as a viable lower cost option with the same performance. A review of Amazon, Best Buy and other sellers revealed that the MSI 65 was higher ranked then the Razor Blade by people who purchased the laptops with the GS 65 having 4.5 stars and the Blade 3.5.The one point that people made against the GS 65 was that it was not constructed as well as the Blade. I agree with this, holding them side by side was almost enough to go with the Blade. However the heating issue with th Blade and the fact that I would be paying hundreds of dollars more for the same performance but a better case made me go with the GS 65.The GS 65 runs like a dream with a beautiful display. I have not experianced it getting too hot and it has run everything I have thrown at it on ultra settings. The one thing I did not like is that MSI partioned the 512 SSD hardrive. Plan on undoing this next week and adding a second SSD hardrive for extra storage.As far a the GS 65’s construction, after using the laptop I do not find it to be flimsy. It is lightweight and the material used for the case plays a large part in keeping the weight down. As long as you are not banging on the keyboard should not be an issue.",0
(Hardware problem within 3 months of use.): Screen has become unstable - breakups and flashes every few seconds.International warranty only valid in country of purchase which is not helpful.Would not buy another one again.,0
"(So Happy with this laptop so far!!!): Edit - All computers with - the intel AX200 card for Wif6, have connection issues trying to see or connect to a Wifi6 router.---This is by far the fastest and Coolest laptop I have ever owned.!.!.I really love how this Keyboard feels and the key travel is wonderful.I am a developer and I downloaded a bunch of software and then installed everything back to back, I have run this puppy hard for about a week, and have never once felt any heat out of this thing.I do wish that it had the bigger battery but oh well this one seems to be doing just fine.I tested it by just using it normally and it lasted a few hours no problem.The Keyboard has stayed nice and cool.Why did I choose this laptop over the HP Omen?1) When I looked at the HP Omen they never replied to anybody's question, Lenovo did. That showed me better customer support right there. In-fact the very day I received it, I logged on to Lenovo's 24/7 support and asked a few questions and they replied with help instantly.#2) VALUE for the price compared to the HP - you will be able to buy this laptop and opt for the 4yr accidental damage warranty at amazon checkout and still be cheaper than the HP Omen.!.!.!Also you WILL NOT be disappointed with the performance! 8 cores and 16 threads, man the webpages load so fast its crazy!Buy it and enjoy!",0
(I like it.): Low price with reasonable performance.,0
(Absolutley Terrible): On the rare occasion I can get the thing to turn on. It takes 15 minutes to warm up.Using the internet is painfully slow. Even being the only device connected to my router. With 150 Mbps. (I intenetspeedtest.com'd it from another device.) it absolutely crawls.I cannot have more than about 2 tabs open in a browser at any time or the system starts spinning and the computer becomes useless.My son bought these for myself and his assistant to use and we cant even use them.Waste of money,0
"(Perfect for the Money!): The key board uses every color under the rainbow and will alternate between colors. It is fast and it has played anything that I have thrown at it like Red Dead Redemption 2, Red Dead Redemption, STAR WARS Jedi Fallen Order?, Borderlands,2,3, and every game that I have on STEAM plays excellent on this. It does run a little warm. But if you use the cooler boost it cools down but it id load. Right now as typing I'm at 38c 100f. But the fan is silent right now.

The build quality is nice, it is light weight with a large screen and it is excellent to have a full keyboard. Keep in mind with Chromebooks it is all web based so you don't have the full operating system slowing down the speed like a traditional laptop. Also HP has a similar model with 2 gbs of memory but for $30 more you can double it, such a great deal!",0
"(No Logout Option For Gmail Is Your Main Issue Here!): I would just like to say I’m a simple woman. No hassle! Why wouldn’t we be told that if we signed into our google account, it’s like that forever with this chrome laptop??? Why do we have to use Guest just to browse other email accounts on our own laptop?? Not giving someone no option at all to sign out, of anything for that matter, is just stupid. I don’t like being forced to do things a certain way, especially if the laptop was bought to multitask! So yeah, a waste to me. Plus the storage won’t even let you delete files once the storage is used up. Smh just irritating. Google has got to do better man. It’s so many complaints about this issue. This laptop still giving me issues to this day.",0

"(Great for using Office 365): This is a low end, kinda underpowered machine. That's not a complaint, just the fact. I'm finding it useful for Office 365 in Chrome - don't bother with the Office apps. I also have the Fortinet VPN client to access the company VPN. And I found a good RDP client to connect to computers in the office. All in all, a good machine for the money for what I'm doing with it. And it's Android, so there isn't the maintenance overhead of a Windows machine. Buy em for your road warriors.EDIT 17 Jan 19 - I'm currently working to get the StrongSwan VPN client to working in order to connect Point-To-Site to my Azure VPN. I know it can be done, but getting the StrongSwan configuration correct is a bear. If anyone out there has used StrongSwan to connect P2S to an Azure VPN, send me a comment. Otherwise, I'll post when I get it working on my own. Why do this? So that I can access my Linux VMs via SSH and my Windows Server VMs via RDP.",0
"(Great budget laptop for high schooler): Bought this for my daughter who is in high school. I was very pleasantly surprised by the performance of this budget laptop. She uses flash based educational programs, watches YouTube and checks her gmail. No bloatware installed and it comes with 1 year of accidental damage when you register it. She loves the fingerprint reader, wide screen and the backlit keyboard. The camera is acceptable for video chatting and includes an led light when it is on. The chassis was surprisingly stiff for a budget laptop and the keyboard had acceptable feedback and feel. The screen quality isn't the best, but for a budget laptop, it is livable.",0
"(Light, powerful laptop - worth every penny.): This laptop is fantastic. Light, with an aluminum shell. The keyboard has a little give, but that is pretty similar to my previous laptop and chromebook. The laptop moves quickly, the screen is bright and crisp, stays connected to the internet. Gaming is pretty limited as this isn't a gaming laptop but the intel hd 620 chipset handles 3d images with no problem and modern games can be played with a bit of tweaking.",0
"(Stunning Gaming Computer): This computer is absolutely stunning! It appears to handle games amazingly well! So far I've had no performance issues. When I first bought the computer, I was worried there would be a lot of bloatware preinstalled onto the computer that might slow it down, or would consume my time hunting down and removing, yet it was not the case! There was few unnecessary programs preinstalled which made setting the laptop up quick and painless. I have not noticed the laptop over heating and it is generally quite quiet. When loading into a level or map on a game, the fans get loud for a few seconds, but that is to be expected. I highly recommend to ANYONE looking to get into gaming, or looking to switch to a gaming laptop. I needed something that would allow me to continue gaming, while also working well for this upcoming year at school, and this looks like it'll be perfect!",0

"(Laptop not charging or turning on.): I had previously bought the 9th generation and it's great. In fact, it works perfectly with the exception of the occasional scrambled Youtube or Facebook video (To play those videos I have to downgrade the video quality). So I thought it would have been a good idea to get the same or better for my sister so I bought an Amazon refurbished Nitro. When I actually got the laptop, it would not turn on or charge and I had to returned it. Then I bought a new one and as luck would have it, it's the same situation. At this point I'm not getting the impression any of these laptops are working and I don't think I'll purchasing anymore of these on Amazon.",0
"(Disappointment and frustration): I've been a PC user forever and decided to give Chromebook a try. It's easy to set up, and I love the ease of sharing documents, but that's it. My Chromebook disconnects from my wireless printer at least once a month, and takes hours to reconnect; it's very non-intuitive when I'm trying to pull documents from my external drive; I (and this is my fault, but still a consideration) can't seem to master the differences between ""my drive"" and ""cloud storage"", so finding documents is always a challenge. And I find it nearly impossible to organize my many documents in an intuitive, usable way that I always could with any PC. Bottom line, I've been using the Microsoft O/S since they started and the Google O/S is just too many new tricks for this old dog. I'm buying a new PC today and tossing my Chromebook in the trash where it belongs.",0

"(Hardcore vs. Casual): If you’re looking at this laptop as a hardcore gamer- I’m sure you will be disappointed.If you’re a casual gamer, like myself- you will be thrilled with your purchase. The graphics are great, and I haven’t experienced any level of lag playing a variety of games.I also do CAD/3D modeling professionally, and this laptop hasn’t let me down running all of the heavy-hitters: Revit, Navisworks, AutoCAD- and I’m talking large, large files.The fans are loud (loudest I have ever heard, but still bearable), the battery life is terrible, and I wouldn’t want to have to use the pad on any laptop; this one is no exception.There’s a quirk with the volume keys as well- you have to press the function key, and the left/right arrows to adjust the volume; up/down to adjust brightness. There’s no way to change this, and if you have smaller hands- it is not a one-handed operation.All-in-all, I love this laptop.I bought a Razer Viper Mini mouse to forego the pad, and it really brightens my day. Lets me do my work, play my games, and have no frustrations while doing any of it.",0
"(Mode ""S"" marketing trick): Didn't know what mode ""S"" was when I bought this thing.

That includes any other browser you may be fond of! Total bummer, right up to I canceled mode S and went back to what I usually do and use on MY machine. Nuff said!",0

Both devices ran very slow and several computer keys broke off of the keyboard within 5 months of use. I contacted Amazon on 2/23rd and spoke to a representative who is now trying to charge me a restocking fee. Due to the timing of returning the product being 7 days past the expiration date. They are not honoring their policy or extended warranty and a company that makes their customers eat so much as a restocking fee does not value their customer's loyalty. Not to mention, Amazon is getting too big to fail.... they will be the next giant conglomerate that will tank out economy.",0
"(Fast Tasker): Someone else has written--and this seems true to me after researching this past laptop purchase--that it's impossible to check all the boxes at the $500 max price point: You might find a computer with amazing screen quality, but average processor; or a great processor but no SSD drive. It seems at $500 you have to let some box go unchecked.So, to me, when searching for this last computer the question morphed from, ""What's the perfect computer for $500?"" to ""What box am I willing to leave unchecked?""We are a homeschooling family who uses the computer to crunch math homework, keep up on email, shop online, run Office, and stream videos with the whole family watching.We are not gamers.So, our older laptops having grown slow and having used up memory, we decided what was most important was a fast processor that would be reasonably current for a couple years, and a screen with good viewing angles and resolution--but we didn't need outrageous amounts of processor speed or memory or high-end graphics card for gaming. We did want a housed DVD player, but decided that we could put up with the hassle of an exterior drive if that meant going from the i3 to i5 processor.I hoped to squeeze an SSD in for the $500 price point, too, but soon discovered that was unrealistic given everything else we wanted.So, we purchased this version of the 330 S because of the iV processor and because of the high resolution (1920 X 1080 HD) and viewing angles (the ability to sit at the side of the computer and still see well). Stepping up to the i5 did mean some sacrifices: We did have to give up on an SSD--and an onboard DVD player/burner, and I did fret about reviews saying that screen was not as bright as others, but, in the end we were pleased with our purchase, even finding an added bonus we hadn't counted on (more on that later).First, speed. Processor speed and internet connectivity has been excellent: click, you're there. I can't pinpoint any delays, even though at times our virus protector simultaneously performs tasks. So, this computer in terms of speed of tasking the usuals such as Web shopping, email, YouTube, multiple windows and tasks, etc., has been such a welcomed step up from our three year-old, but competent HP laptop. We are very happy with tasking speed.I hoped to get an SSD, but this 330S comes with digital ""optane"" memory that shortens start up times considerably, and I would say we reach operability quite quickly even with the standard mechanical hard drive--due to the optane system. I am a believer. It seems just a few moments slower than my SSD drive desktop at work. Just a tick of a difference.We do use this computer to both stream films and play DVD's, so we had to purchase a $40 external optics drive. In terms of performance, everything is fine. Some reviews criticized the screen as being too dim or not vibrant--though everyone agrees (and they should!) that the resolution is excellent. I have to say, with the brightness has been fine. It could be true that the colors are not as rich or vibrant as other computers, but I haven't noticed, or maybe I'm just not that picky. All I can say is that brightness has not been an issue, and the resolution is VERY clear. A nice step up from our 3 year old laptop. Important too for a family that relies on the laptop for movie time, you can view nicely from side angles, so no one has to fight for the middle seat of the couch.One downside is that we have to use an external DVD player, as this computer does not come housed with one. The external drive has worked fine, but it is a hassle to have to hook it up, and I count on at some point the kids stepping on it or losing the cord.The speaker system is good and a step up for our needs. I can listen to a streamed video comfortably across a room if there aren't other distractions, but generally I use external speakers with laptops anyway.The surprise extra was the lightness of the computer and the pleasing design of the brushed aluminum. My wife and I agreed we didn't care if our computer looked big or clunky: We weren't trying to impress anyone at the coffee shop, and we certainly didn't want to sacrifice performance for lightness or slimness or hipness.But, it has been nice to have a relatively light, slim computer that otherwise performs well in terms of speed and screen resolution. I feel like we got the speed we wanted, and ""I'll be derned, it is light and reasonably hip!""So, to sum:Give up trying to check ALL the boxes.We decided processor speed and youthfulness and high screen resolution and good viewing angles were most important.We feel happy that we got a fast processor that should stay current for a couple years on the basic tasking we do, and we are pleased with the screen and viewing angles.What did we give up? No high end graphics card (we aren't gamers, so who cares), no in-house DVD player (a minor, but to be honest appreciable inconvenience, but one we are willing to live with given the speed), no SSD but start up time is greatly enhanced by the Optane system. Is the screen dimmer than others, less vibrant? I dunno. Maybe I am missing something, but I suspect, like me, you will find it is a pleasant step up from screens you've been using.Why four stars? Well, at $500, there simply is not FIVE STAR option.We're pleased with the boxes we were able to check!",0
"(Acer Aspire E15 - a 5-star product!): This laptop was everything I had hoped for and it is incredibly packed with features for anywhere near the price. Since I'm a Prime member, it arrived in two days flat. Nice! The packaging and shipping was excellent, the laptop box itself is packed in its slim cardboard packing with a perfect fit and then packed in an outer box as well. Absolutely no damage, dents or bruises at all. AC Adapter and minimal documentation included (no media). There's really nothing else needed, it appears to have one of the newer kinds of battery that's internal and not user changeable, and it charges well. On the initial screens you can choose to turn OFF all the slide controls that offer to send info to Microsoft. (recommended).One thing you have to be prepared for due to Windows 10, is that as soon as you reach the place where you give it whatever means of internet connection you use - it takes over and begins the update cycle. The large 3GB Windows 10 ver 1709 takes some patience, so just let it do it's thing and give it as much as several hours. You want to make sure that it's all up to date first before you go in and tweek things. So don't begin that process until you can spare several hours, and you'll be in good shape.It came with what I'd call minimal bloatware. Some folks want that stuff, I did not. I uninstalled xbox gaming, MS Store, an eBay shortcut and several other items I had no use for. The 30-day eval of MS Office wasn't going to do me any good so I uninstalled that as well. Less than 10 minutes lost to cleanup - no problem. Looking at the add/remove programs listing in the Control Panel, you can see it comes with the usual nice collection of Acer utilities, so don't remove those. And when you do finish the installation and have it configured just the way you want, take the time to do a Windows Image backup to an external USB drive, along with a Restore DVD, that's your very best means of recovery later on if you ever crash your drive.This is a very well-made laptop and the best by far of any of the several former Acer laptops I've owned in the past. Sturdy, powerful, loaded with all the latest and fastest ports, (you have to love the 802.11ac WiFi, it's a screamer) - along with a 1TB drive, plenty of RAM and expandable to a whopping 32GB - it's a great buy and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone wanting high performance in a low-cost package. Everyone has their preferences, true - but I give this model 5 stars for Amazon's packing, shipping, and Acer's very best product line yet. And I'm an IT Professional of some 24 years, so I get my hands on some very top-dollar laptops for business. I think you'll be pleased with this one!",0

"(not happy at all!!!): Ever since I got computer I have had a few issues. The hard drive is extremely noisy, louder than what it should be. The pad for moving the cursor around does not work worth a darn.I have contacted customer service and they have failed to respond. The HP computer I had was replaced because it was running slow, not opening up sometimes, and just getting old.The ideapad 330 that I bought run slower than the six-year-old HP that I had.They have said all along that if there were issues to please contact customer service, which I have done and have not heard anything from them since I started trying to get in touch with them in September.Of course now the 30 day warranty is gone and I will probably end up having to take this in and have somebody work on it to find out what the issue is with the hard drive. They will most likely have to fix a finger pad for moving the cursor around.This is a great product to be don't mind spending money on something that is supposed to be working, henceforth, not real happy.Since I first wrote this review, I have tried to contact the company on several occasions. I have been unable to reach tech support through their recommended process comma email.I will end up taking this piece of junk in to get it fixed.",0

"(Killer Value (i7/GTX 2070 Max-P) at $1399): I purchased this for one thing and one thing only: gaming. I wanted something portable, powerful, and at a reasonable price point and the GL65 hits all those marks. The machine is mostly plastic, but it doesn't feel ""cheap"". It feels solid enough and looks decent. Hard to beat the price/performance ratio you can get out of this machine at $1399 with the i7, 16GB RAM, and RTX 2070 Max-P. I briefly considered getting the GE66 with 2070 Super but the premium is just not worth the modest performance boost. The fans do get quite loud when gaming, but it's not so bothersome since I usually wear a headset anyways. Thermals are decent and undervolting the i7's core/cache is pretty easy. The panel does have some moderate backlight bleed around the webcam at the top, I think it's the plastic bezel cover putting pressure on the LCD but it's not a big deal. Otherwise, the panel is bright, good colors, and looks really great with the fast refresh rate (144hz). Would have been nice to see this machine with an AMD Ryzen CPU option, but alas...",0
"I bougt this laptop thinking in my daughter school homeworks, downloading and playing music and watching internet videos.",0
"(Excellent Value(8th Gen), Perfect for Students and Those on a Budget): The ASUS Zenbook ux330ua(8th gen) is an excellent value. As a CS graduate student, I needed something that could handle a heavy coding workload while still being portable enough to bring to class and not break the bank. This fit the bill perfectly, and I highly recommend it to students or anyone who wants a premium ultrabook experience at a budget-friendly price.Display 5/5:This is one the best displays you will find on a device under $1000. 100% sRGB coverage is a must have for me. As someone who does a moderate amount of graphics coding and web design, I need to know the colors on my screen are accurate. For those who don't use this device for content creation, you will still enjoy the vivid colors, respectable black levels, and sharp 1080p resolution. The matte display also prevents distracting reflections. Note: There was no noticable backlight bleeding on my unit. It's there if you look for it, but you would be hard pressed to notice it in any real use case scenario. This is not a fault of ASUS as this is typical for IPS displays in general. I also did not have any dead pixels.Keyboard 4/5:The keyboard is respectable if not remarkable. The keys have good travel but are slightly mushy. My unit will sometimes fail to detect when keys are pressed near their corners. The layout is fine, and the half height arrow keys are surprisingly very usable. This keyboard will not remind you of a ThinkPad, but it will get the job done and has held up well to my coding sessions.Audio 5/5:The audio is excellent for a an ultrabook in this price range. It probably won't fill a large conference room, but the built-in speakers are perfect for online lecture videos or the occasional Amazon Prime video.Build Quality 4/5:This device can't quite hold up to the industry leaders like the Surface Laptop, MacBook, ThinkPad, or XPS products. However, those devices are in other price category entirely. At the current price, it certainly outshines the competition, namely the Acer Swift. The chassis is lightweight, and the spun aluminum finish is a beautiful touch. There is a small amount of flex around the keyboard and screen areas. However, I wouldn't consider it to be durability concern.Battery Life 5/5:The battery life was a major selling pont for me. I am getting 8-10 hours depending on usage. As a student on the go, being able to work all day on one charge is a game changer and should be industry standard by now.Performance 5/5:The quad core Intel i5 8250u processor has excellent performance and represents a huge jump from the previous generation's dual core. Pairing this CPU with 8GB of ram and a 256GB SSD, this device will remain a solid performer for years to come. I can easily run a Linux VM to do any work I can't do on Windows. and the performance is superb. The graphics processor is an integrated Intel UHD 620. While this won't be suitable for any heavy gaming, it is perfectly suited for light graphics work, video watching, and displaying to external monitors. You can even play some older or less demanding video games at respectable settings(CounterStrike: GO, Half-Life 2, etc.).Overall 5/5:This is an excellent ultrabook for those on a budget. If you are still reading at this point, there is a good chance you should go ahead and buy this product. You won't be disappointed. For those with a bit more wiggle room in their budget, take a look at the Zenbook ux410 and ux430. Those devices manage to fit a 14"" screen in the same chassis by using smaller bezels around the display.Additional Comments:This device is highly compatable with Linux. I have had no issues with any distro I have tried. I can confirm it works flawlessly with Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, and with elementaryOS 0.4.",0

"(Worst ""Gaming"" Laptop Ever.): This is hands down one of the WORST laptops ever. I ordered this because I seen it on a ton of lists, articles, and YouTube videos as the perfect budget ""gaming"" laptop. I only ever play Roblox, The Sims 4, and I wanted to start playing Stardew Valley so I thought this would be a great early Christmas gift for myself. Ordered it, had no issue with shipping issues whatsoever but when it arrived and I was done setting it up problems quickly arose. The sound quality is absolutely horrendous, the trackpad placement is god awful, and most importantly the screen is incredibly dim despite turning up the brightness all the way. I went into settings and tinkered with the sound quality, looked up countless YouTube videos to resolve the issue, and even went as far as to go onto the actual Acer website and try and find a solution but, the sound quality was still absolutely terrible. I tried playing Roblox on it and though the computer ran the game nicely the screen quality was terrible and so dim I could barely see I am certain you'd get a headache from it. When it comes to the trackpad if you're using a mouse you probably wouldn't have an issue but if you use the trackpad along with using WASD if your hand grazes the trackpad the mouse messes up and flys all over the screen. I returned this ""gaming"" laptop today and I had to pay $60 out of my own pocket just to send this piece of crap back to where it came from. Hopefully I get my money back. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP!!!",0
"(You get what you pay for): I purchased this chromebook for small little things, mostly to do some writing while traveling. A chromebook appealed to me because a lot of the work I do is linked through Google. I spent a decent amount of time researching, and I am sorry to say that I pegged this one wrong.For starters the battery life is absolutely atrocious. I gave it a full charge right out of the box without ever turning it on, just like it says in the manual, and used it maybe twice. The big issue wasn't the amount of battery life while using it per say, but I learned that when you power it off, it doesn't truly shut off. It concerned me at first when I noticed that it turns on right away every single time you open the lid. It doesn't power off, it hibernates. So you are draining battery life even when it is sitting on your shelf ""powered off"".If that wasn't bad enough, even if you change it in the power settings to not sleep when the lid is closed, you cannot control when the screen shuts off. If the screen shuts off, yes, you guessed it, it hibernates again.... Really terrible if you are, I don't know, say, in the middle of uploading some pictures from an SD card, and are not constantly hovering around the device to keep hitting a key or moving the track pad to keep the screen on.On that note, the device is really really really slow. I am a huge fan of samsung products, but this one is just terrible. My Galaxy S7 is faster than this thing is. That's pretty despicable.In terms of the physical device itself. I should have thought to get a backlit keyboard. O boy was that dumb of me. And speaking of keyboards, it looks like they crammed in as much as they could into such a small space and went: ""What do you think people will use the most?"" and then cut those keys. Besides your basic ASDF and 1-9 keys there is nothing else really on the keyboard. And the Caps Lock is replaced by a search key. Don't think I needed it, but then again, I didn't do as good of a job researching this time around.Do yourself a favor and spend slightly more money for something good.",0
"(Average computer for an above average price): I have owned this computer for almost 2 years now and all I can say is that it is very average. I would highly recommend building your own pc, you will have much better performance for the same price as this machine. Performance is ok but it has a hard time running a game with programs running in the background. The one thing good about this laptop is that it is pretty light and very portable.",0
"(Only had a short time, but Great so far): Great so far, but I only used it a short time. We'll see how well it helps up!",0
"(Great laptop): Perfect for what I needed. Starts up quick. Very lightweight. Only complaints are the way the number pad on the right is set up. Some of the keys feel out of place compared to what I used previously. And that it’s windows 10 s. I like using google chrome as my browser but I guess edge will do. I know you can take it out iof s mode but knowing my luck, I’d f@$k up the laptop.",0
"(Wrong size!!): Wrong size. I ordered a Asus vivobook 15 thin and light laptop, 15.6"" FHD Display. I got an 11.6"" size.",0
(Good): Great value,0
"(Possible battery issue?): Just got this two days ago. So far my only issue is the battery, which I used off the charger last night for an hour or two and now that I’ve plugged it back in it’s only charged to 95% and stopped. It won’t charge any further.",0
"(Screen looks damaged, cheap): Can't say much about the cpu since the screen already looks damaged from the start.",0
(Pretty good): It’s pretty good so far.,0
"(First impressions): Really like this laptop. Small, light and looks great. Hardest part of setting up the computer was turning it on. Found my network and found my wireless printer with no issues. About two hours to bring it to a full charge and I was off and running to the great network in the sky.Early days yet but very happy after day 1.",0
"(I love it): I needed a new laptop and wanted to get a gaming laptop so picked this one up. It was delivered quickly. I opened up the box and pulled out the laptop and was instantly happy. I like the design and the way it looks. It opens and closes easily. Turns on and boots up quickly. The keys have a nice feel to them when pressed and I like that it has the number pad on the right side, because I dont like using the numbers at the top of the keyboard. The screen is bright with great resolution.The webcam worked just fine. I connected a pair of Bluetooth earbuds without any issue. Connecting to wifi was easy and my speeds are as expected. And then I tried out a couple of games. I play mostly Civilization games but a few other ones, and everything ran just fine. Actually Civilization ran well later in the game where it would usually slow down a lot on my old laptop, so that was nice.Overall I think this is a nice gaming laptop at its price point. It isn't high end but neither is the price. However it's pretty solid and worth the cost. I love it.",0

"(Too many design issues to ignore. Hope Razer can correct these for 2019.): I'm giving this laptop 1-star, even though it probably deserves 2 stars, because there are some glaring issues with Razer and their design team that they refuse to address after 7 years of Razer Blades, and it's getting ridiculous at this point.I really thought they'd get it right with all they've learned and this new redesign, but clearly they haven't. I'll give you a rundown of the problems with more detail later.List of issues:- ? key is in the wrong place (so frustrating to type)- Keys with a 2nd function (all f-keys and ?,>,<, etc) don't backlight their secondary function so you can't tell which keys control volume at night- touchpad lockout when typing is terrible. My mouse always jumps around when my palm touches the touchpad while typing- This laptop runs VERY hot. Even just using a web browser causes the palm rest to heat up.- no fingerprint reader for windows sign-on in a $2500 machine- The laptop isn't too heavy for what it is, but the power brick is SO HEAVY. Any weight savings from the thin laptop are lost if you have to carry the brick- Razer proprietary power jack means that replacement/additional adapters will be very expensive ($100)- They keyboard is ok, not great. You'd think for a gaming laptop they'd put a more robust keyboard inside. This one fees like the keyboard on a microsoft surface pro (which is fine, but not great for gaming)- There should be an additional USB 3.0 port on the opposite side to future-proof the machine. Also, the laptop should be able to run off a thunderbolt charger, and just disable the graphics card when doing so.- Fans run audibly even when computer sits at idle- Green Razer logo on back of screen cannot be adjusted (color or brightness). I'm not thrilled about advertising to people that I'm working on a $2500 machine. Razer clearly cares more about their marketing than the potential safety of their users against would-be thieves.- And possibly the biggest issue - THE LAPTOP DOESNT CHARGE IF YOU PLUG IT IN AFTER IT'S BEEN TURNED OFF. Yes, you read that correctly. You must turn on the laptop, then turn it off with the power adapter plugged in, for it to continue charging. Between this and the ? key placement, and the poorly designed keyboard and backlighting, I'd say these flaws are unforgivable in a $2400+ machine from a reputable company with 10+years experience in hardware manufacturing.I'm returning this one and getting a Gigabyte Aero 15x, which I'll also review once I receive it.",0
(Malfunctioning laptop): The laptop came malfunctioning. When I started the laptop a message appeared informing that the system as detected that a cooling fan is not operating correctly.,0
(Price & convenience): Nice laptop 4 the price. I would recommend.,0
(Good Product @ Great Price): Fast and Reliable,0
the light up led and the difference in color for the MOBA keys it was nice,0
(Buyer Beware): Piece of junk! It lasted exactly 2 years and the hardware failed. I took it to Best Buy and they said it’s not worth the cost to fix it. Very disappointed in Samsung.,0
Backlight bled up from the bezel,0
(5 stars for the price): Does what I need it for under $300. I will add more Ram. The OS takes up almost all 4gb imstalled. I know there are other chromebooks that are cheaper but I needed windows for some apps I own.,0
(Super potente): La mejor máquina portatil para gamers. Funciona perfecto. Muy silenciosa.,0
"(Great laptop while it works): I ordered this laptop to be used for work and for gaming. When it arrived everything was great; it was faster, larger, and had a discrete graphics card powerful enough to run any of the games in my library. It has some quirks to it but nothing that was off putting.Under a full load the laptop does get warm and the fans get loud to keep it running at full speed, but that is to be expected without forcing the laptop to limit itself in order to stay cooler.When closing the lid the laptop would enter standby but keyboard lights would not turn off.The biggest problem was the hard drive. After 2 weeks the hard drive failed causing an unmountable boot partition error during windows boot. In addition to this error, I could no longer access the recovery system from MSI. I attempted to use a windows installation USB to reinstall windows completely, but when the hard drive was detected it could only be mounted as read-only preventing the installer from installing or modifying the hard drive at all.I contacted MSI and within 2 days had an offer to RMA the laptop to MSI for repair. The problem is with a 2 week old laptop I was now being told I needed to pay to ship the laptop to MSI and the turnaround time could be anywhere from 3-6 weeks. For a new laptop with 2 weeks of use, a 6 week down time was unacceptable to me. This is why I lowered my rating to 3 stars.",0
"(No coil whine): Cool and quiet. Messed around lightroom, light gaming, web browsing. So far so good.",0
(Love it): Just want to say it’s exactly What I wanted very happy with it.,0
"(me encanto): muy buen dise?o, una bonita pantalla y gracias al ssd es muy veloz",0
"(College notebook): Bought this for my son. His first year of school was with a very old laptop that was more geared to gaming. He ending up hating that laptop when he needed actually needed it to be portable. But that allowed him to define what he really wanted and needed a new unit to do. He wanted a smaller screen (<15""), lightweight, longer battery life. This hits all those points, is quite stylish, plus more. It was expensive, and my major concern with it is that there is no replaceable battery. This travels almost like a tablet, but definitely feels like a notebook computer. He loves it.",0
(Awesome laptop): Love it so far and very fast. Fast shipping too,0
Battery life is awful,0
(Five Stars): This is a great item. And the price is fantastic. I highly recommend this Chromebook.,0
(I am In love): Just received it two days ago and I am in love. I put the fan in the max mode (cooler boost) as soon as I game and so far the computer hasn’t even heated a bit. The MSI dragon app is perfect for tracking it. Thermals are amazing and the RTX2070 IS A BEAST. And oh boy that screen and the refresh rate. Damn. Damn. I am in love. Speakers are way better than any laptop I’ve ever had.Cons : fans are extremely loud in coolerboost mode (but I mean who doesn’t game with a headset)I ran into a few issues with sound drivers but I’ve been able to solve them.,0
"The laptop boots up quickly, operates great and works without issues of any kind that I can see.",0
(Affordable and great quality): This Chromebook came quickly and works great. I wanted something that I could use easily at home and this has been a perfect choice. I’m extremely happy with it!,0
(Doesn't last long): If you're looking for a temporary gaming laptop this would be perfect. If you're looking for a gaming laptop that will last you more than a year with no issues keep looking. The type of issues I started getting after a year are ridiculous considering the price such as having to replace the thermal compound and needing to replace the fan seriously not worth it to buy overpriced faulty hardware.,0
"it is slim and not bulky, making it very portable.",0
"(Not a bad laptop. Got great either. Lame look. Not very good for VR.): The CPU is decent. The screen looks good, though the viewing angle is mediocre. The GPU is acceptable, but is a bit stuttery in demanding VR games like Boneworks. I'll probably send this back and spend a little more money on a more powerful laptop.It also looks lame with the red backlit keyboard keyboard and accents on the WASD keys. I might think that's cool if I were 16 years old.Biggest positives are the keyboard feels pretty good, pretty decent screen, stays cool and solid battery life if not gaming. But you always get what you pay for, and in the end, there's no hiding that it's an entry level machine. If you are on a strict budget and can get this on the $599 flash sale or less, it's worth the money.If you can afford more, then look for laptops closer to $1000 rather than trying to save a little money with this. Look for an i7 with a GTX 1660 Ti or RTX 2060 and at least 16 GB RAM.",0
"(Decent laptop and easy to upgrade): It is 15’ AMD R7 3700U, SSD256, with 8gb ram, Win 10 proI bought Samsung 32GB ram and replaced with the existing one, maximum capacity is 64GB and now I have 40 GB of RAM and it is a beast. Opening the chassis was so easy, disconnected the battery and then replaced the ram with new one and that’s it.I also bought WD HHD 1TB of capacity cost me 56 dollars. Installing it was so easy and already cable and case is available inside it. Note that the type I bought is 2.5”, 7mm thick other than this will not fit. After installation go to desk management and you will see the new partition just right click on it and select new simple volume and enter the size you want if need more than one partition and that’s it.Also I changed my WIFI card which is upgradeable to WIFI 6 AX200 NGW.The chassis has good finish, it is plastic but relatively stiff, disappointed with trackpad at the begging however adjusting sensitivity make it much better, nice anti-glare screen with very good brightness, acceptable screen bezel, surprised with the speakers strength, decent camera, very good browsing speed, very happy with the keyboard especially with the caps lock light and other keys shortcuts, of course it would be better with backlit still though to me the best keyboard I’ve ever used. I haven’t tested battery life that much but it seems to me it will lasts for 4-5 hrs with mid to heavy of using.No bloatware at all but Macafee Antivirus.In general, the laptop is very good and I recommend to buy one for home, business, and student users and even for light to mid range gaming of course with using the lowest settings.",0
(llego con buen empaque en su transporte): buena compu para renders de arquitectura,0
"(Terrific price to performance ratio): The last gaming laptop I owned was an Acer Predator Helios from 2017. I ended up giving it to a cousin as a graduation present because my Surface Book 2 matched its performance and served me as a work laptop as well. I purchased the Legion 5 this year in order to gain better performance and extend the life of my SB2 by offloading all games.All I can say is: Wow, what a difference 3.5 years makes! The midrange Legion 5 is vastly better than a midrange gaming laptop from 2017, and at the same price.The display is the most immediately noticeable improvement. This 144hz display has really good black levels and brightness. Games really pop off the screen, and have never looked sharper. It is a non-touch panel with a semi-matte finish that does a great job attenuating reflections. There is a 720p webcam, which is pretty mediocre. But it has a privacy cover (nice) and I anticipate never using it.The internals are also really powerful for the price. The Ryzen 7 4800H/GTX 1660ti combo mops the floor with the Core i7 7700HQ/GTX 1060 of the Helios. I would say that, on the same games, performance increase is nearly double. What really impressed me though is how good the Radeon integrated graphics chip performs. There were some older games that were having trouble with the 1660ti, and the Radeon totally crushed them in terms of FPS and visual quality. When you can enable anti-aliasing on your internal chip, things are going pretty well.The package you get for the price is really solid. 512gb of SSD space with an expansion bay is a good value in my book. 16gb of RAM is enough for all but the most punishing loads. This laptop could also double as an Adobe workstation, as it crushes rendering and exporting tasks for programs like Premiere Pro and Photoshop. And it's in a tasteful body to boot, no ""Extreme"" gamer accents here! The only thing missing is an SD card slot, but that would really only affect buyers who want to do video editing or content creation.The fans do kick in on most 3D games, but only really get into high mode on more demanding titles like Jedi Fallen Order, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Arkham Knight, and Dead or Alive 6. With that said, the air being blown out by the fans is not terribly hot, so it seems clear the laptop is engaging the fans out of an abundance of caution. Ambient fan noise when not gaming is almost negligible, which means this would be a good work/play combo machine. You are offered some fan control with 3 modes: quiet/balanced/performance. The Quiet mode does reduce fan noise unless a game starts pushing heavy loads.All in all, I am gobsmacked by the value and performance. I had been holding off on a gaming laptop because my experience with the Acer had given me the impression that they involved too many compromises compared to my SB2. But the Legion 5 has really blown me a way. I recommend it wholeheartedly for anyone who wants a mid-range dedicated gaming laptop or a machine that can pull double duty for work.",0

"(From Mac Air to Chromebook without looking back! Great transition!!!): It is very stressful for me to get new tech, being a more ""experienced"" person. My last phone had me wanting to throw it into large vats of water or stomp it with both feet and I did return it 3 times before finally managing to semi-adjust to it and I now have a so-so relationship with that piece of frustrating technology. So, when my Mac Air started to circle the drain I dreaded getting a new lap top. When my son recommended Chromebook I was skeptical that it could be as simple as it sounded to set up and use. But I was totally amazed!!! I had the lap top open and I was logged in with gmail in 5 minutes.Anything that I have needed to do has been easy to google. The screen quality and sound are both better than I had with the Mac but it was pretty old. The simple set up, speed and use of docs and downloads has been easy and I didn't have to buy software extra like I did with Mac. I also found connecting to my HP printer was much easier than the process to connect on my Mac.For me to transition from a Mac to the Chromebook was very smooth. This screen is so much larger than my Mac and has taken some getting used to. At this price my husband has encouraged me to get a smaller one to carry when we go somewhere but I am adjusting to this larger size. I thought the large size would be a viewing plus and it is. It's heavier than the small Mac and that is the adjustment. I use it for basics and work- banking, contracts, etc and I am very pleased!!! I will add that I never liked iPhones but did like my Mac Air but like the Chromebook much better so far.",0
(Not reliable for work or other important use): I was just about to purchase another one for my grandson when the laptop turned off on its own and would not turn back on. After some time I was able to do a hard reset and get it to start back up. I've only had it 10 days. I will not return it as I've already stored important files here and downloaded software I use often. I will probably pass this on to my grandson and find something more reliable for me. He can play games on it but I will not trust my work on it again.,0
"(Nice for the price): Love the size, easy to carry, use it all the time, difficult to hook to printer",0
The design is sleek and streamline,0
"(The Speakers Are HORRIBLE): I love the laptop. I'm usually not a reviewer or a complainer but I think it's really important to let everyone know that the speaker quality is HORRIBLE. Like seriously terrible. For the price I paid for the laptop, and for the way they advertise the speakers, you would think it would at least be loud. I literally have trouble hearing the speakers over the laptop fan. It's a huge bummer. I will say that the graphics quality is amazing. I have been able to play EVERYTHING on ULTRA. It has a decent headphone amp so with my audiophile grade headphones I get amazing sound!Nahimic 1 is downloaded on it as well. They advertise that it is Nahimic 3, but no, it's the outdated software. The screen quality is not the best either.I am happy I bought it, but I do feel a little bit bamboozled so that is why I am giving such a low review. It is pretty disappointing to drop almost 2k on a laptop and it isn't as awesome as you'd hoped.I would do a little bit more shopping and would ultimately go with another laptop, but due to the time constraint I was in, I didn't feel the need to return it completely since I bought it on black friday and couldn't get other discounts since it was delivered well after the holiday was over.I would do some homework and go with something better. Pay a little more for better speakers.",0

The battery will last me 12 hours of gaming, something I didn’t think was even possible out of a high-performance laptop. When I say high performance, I mean it. This thing runs Minecraft on 60 fps with fancy graphics and 24 chunks of render distance; and it doesn’t even get hot! This is probably one of the best tech purchases I’ve ever made.",0

"(Desktop Performance for real!): Man this thing is faster than my i9 9900KS, RTX 3090 $4600 build. Crazy Performance out of a Laptop. TRULY DESKTOP PERFORMANCE. I got this to replace the Samsung Galaxy Pro 360. I returned it because it just didn't have enough Performance to run my audio interface properly. I was going to get the galaxy book 2 pro 360 when it came out but I decided no. I needed better cooling and power. So I found this. And this thing delivers! For power users and super power users. This thing is ridiculous! The Cpu is out of this world! This thing is now my main Music production laptop and also serves as a competitive gaming pc. I didn't think it would be so good for gaming but it's better my $4600 in some games. I said some because I only tried one out. Apex Legends.Also the cooling on this laptop is very very good! ? I pushed it to its limits. And I'm very pleased. It can do whatever i throw at it. I literally can't tell the difference between a powerful desktop and a laptop. It's that good. If i could buy it again I definitely would. And one more thing. It had the latest ports and support. Thunderbolt 4, hdmi 1.2 and fast eternity and latest wifi support. This thing is a beast in itself. If you're thinking of getting an Alienware or razer. Get this instead. Same Performance and All and More bells and whistles for half the price. Don't waste your money on razers overpriced brand name. You're just paying for the name. I mean Asus is starting to get up their too with their expensive name. But way more affordable.",0

"(You're going to need Headphones, but generally pretty good!): For it's price, this laptop does it's job fairly well! Upon first opening the box it was immediately easy to smudge the top of the laptop, as shown in the photos, but I don't personally care about its outward appearance. The actual laptop was very functional and easy to use right upon opening it. When it comes to getting a gaming laptop, I put it through some stress tests, first of which is Skyrim special edition on ultra graphics. And to my delightful surprise, it ran it lag free! but this is where I encountered one of my 2 gripes with this laptop, the fans were SO loud! But I just put on a pair of headphones and didn't really notice them anymore. The second problem I encountered was its battery life! while playing spore on high graphics, which aren't that taxing on a normal computer, the battery lasted 1 hour... Put simply the battery is bad, but if you keep it plugged in as you play any game, it will work fine! In conclusion, this computer has a total of 2 issues, and both of them are easily fixable! Absolutely love this laptop so far!",0
"(Weak hinge): The laptop is great, but the build quality is pretty bad. The hinge on the laptop is weakly bolted to the plastic on the monitor and breaks after a few months. The hinge on the left side came off the plastic a few months ago. I fixed it and glued it back on. Now, the hinge on the right side is broken. It's a hassle having to fix it. It is not a difficult fix, but inconvenient regardless.",0
(Reliable item. Perfect for my needs.): This is a repeat purchase of a Samsung Chromebook model which has been perfect for me. I had the one I replaced for many years - and would have it still if I hadn't spilled a full glass of water onto the keyboard! It is a simple laptop/notebook - and works well for me. It is easy to take when traveling - very reliable. -- The exceptional part of this Amazon purchase is that I received the chromebook at my front door about 16 hours from the time I spilled the water on my keyboard - about 12 hours from when it was ordered! I was delighted!,0

"(Decent Computer for the price): This chromebook is alright. The screen is great for the price, and the keyboard is nice. The trackpad is the worst I've used on a chromebook. It was temperamental with the light clicking. The speakers look like they would be amazing, but they sounded like two tin cans. They were a good volume, though. If all you're doing is watching movies, it should be good. They weren't that great for music if you're picky.I ended up returning this laptop. It was just too heavy/bulky, and I carry it around the house. I got the CB-515 instead. I managed to find it for only $10 more than this computer. It's lighter, faster, and the speakers sound better. The trackpad is twice as nice too...and the keyboard lights up. It's a way better computer.",0
(Hooked on the SSD): Starts up very quickly and a nice RGB keyboard,0
(Best customer support!): We had a little glitch with our laptop; Acer fixed it for us super fast! So impressed.,0
"(One year later, haven't regretted this purchase once.): One year update.I bought this to replace my dinosaur Asus N53SV on a budget. After 5 years, it was still playing the latest demanding games without complaining, and the only problem being a dead battery, I decided to stick with Asus and see if their Zenbooks held up just as well.Long story short, yes. Expectations exceeded.The first thing I noticed out of the box was the quality. The aluminum body is sleek and beautiful and just puts the Macbook Air to shame, IMO. It's incredibly light and just the right size to fit on your lap. And even considering that, it's surprisingly durable. This thing has taken two or three major falls (including one where it was dropped 4 feet onto tile, hit in the corner hard enough to totally bend the metal) and keeps on going like nothing happened.The keyboard is a huge improvement over the one on my old Asus laptop; it takes little effort to type and has a satisfying click. The adjustable backlight is a great bonus.The touchpad, on the other hand, is another story. This is one of the few criticisms I can even make about it, but it can make the laptop a little frustrating to use at first. It took me months to understand just where to touch to use the right-click function, and spent some time annoyed when I'd try to open a link in a new window just to end up clicking on it instead. Once I adjusted to this, it was fine, but it took longer than it should have.My only other gripe is the screen. The matte finish is lovely and the wide viewing angle has come in handy far more often than I thought it would. However, the subtleties in darker tones tend to get lost...pictures of my black cat look more like a silhouette. It's not bad in most situations if I turn the brightness all the way up, but it can make editing pictures a little less accurate.Where this laptop really impressed me is performance. My old Asus was a quad-core i7 with a good dedicated graphics card, and the UX330 slaps the crap out of it (until you really push it with graphics). I can go from opening the laptop to being on the desktop and ready to go within 10 seconds. It's responsive like a sports car and doesn't hesitate to do what you ask. It multitasks like a champ. I was worried that the integrated graphics meant no more games for me, but it hardly even stutters when playing The Sims 3 on a huge open world.Honestly, my only regret is not saving a little more so I could buy an even better Zenbook. But for $750, I almost feel like I stole this laptop.",0
"(Box corner crushed): Ordered this as a Christmas present, when I received it the corner of the laptops box was crushed.",0
(Works perfectly): The light weight and screen touch. Personal,0
(This is far worse than MacBook Air from 2014): My screen cracked just by closing. Search google for cracked screens in M1/M2.,0
"(Apple Pencil and IPad Pro go together like birds of a feather): Love painting with my iPad and pencil. Large screen (12/9) is nice. Fast responses, great enhanced motion.",0
(Very good gaming laptop): This is a very good product. It have a big screen but it is not touch screen. It’s really good at playing video games,0
The feet on the bottom of the laptop are a plastic like material that is prone to sliding,0
(Great bargain for the price and met my expectations!!): I purchased this gift for my grandson. He is virtual schooled and this laptop was perfect. Fast and efficient!!,0
"(Great Laptop for Live streaming): We are using this laptop for livestreaming at our church. I've only had it for a few days, but it has worked well so far. Easy to set up and using it with vMix was no problem. Seems plenty fast enough and the screen is quite bright. I'm driving an external monitor with its USB-C port quite easily. So far, we've encountered no problems.",0
"(Excellent condition, fast delivery.): Mainly used for email . This is the second one I bought to have in another location.",0
"(Works fine, loud fan): It runs the games I play without difficulty, the colors look good. It gets quite hot and the fan is LOUD. I can overlook the loudness of the fan by wearing headphones/a headset. The charging cable however doesn't charge unless it's just so, and for the amount of money I paid for the laptop I'm very annoyed about getting a faulty charger. I gave it 3 stars simply because of the charger issue.",0
"(Horrible battery life.): Right out of the box this laptop feels heavier than expected. Aesthetically this laptop looks great but even with battery saver on, the battery can't even last 2 hours. This is worse than my Lenovo yoga that I purchased more than 4 years ago. All I've done is turn on the laptop and started browsing the web to write this review on Amazon and it's dropped 15% in less than 15 minutes. For this price I really don't think it's worth it. I'm pretty sure I'm going to return this product.",0
"(Amazing steal for the price): Great deal overall. Haven't tried out too many games yet but can play Vermintide II, Diablo 3, Halo MCC and the Ascent on high with zero issue. Decent storage overall. Only real downside is how loud the fan is but I've never had a gaming laptop so maybe that's normal.",0
(Happy should have got bigger screen): It was okay,0
"(Not touch screen): The description states touch screen, but it is not.",0
"(A humble way to play): I tend to prattle exhaustively so I tried to divvy up my numerous opinions into sections you might find relevant.Now/Future = I've been very pleased with this laptop, and I do consider it a great deal for the six hundy spent (on the 9th Gen Intel Core i5-9300H). Not only does it perform splendidly as it comes ""right out the box"", but it's also upgradeable in the near future as tech advances and my finances allow. I've been using it for hours on end everyday for almost one month.Multitasking = I can run WoW (weeeeee!!) while simultaneously streaming music on Spotify in my web browser. Beyond that, I can also minimize my game and music to do a quick Google on whatever boss I'm trying to squelch as I solo dungeons with my Night Elf Demon Hunter. No lag or stuttering while multitasking whatsoever. Nice. B-)Graphics quality = It comes with 2 graphics cards, so be sure to check your in-game settings to make sure the best card is selected. Streaming Netflix and running WoW are lovely in a way I wasn't able to appreciate on my previous HP laptop. My only concern is that once in a while I've seen a rolling screen dim from top to bottom for a split second before it returns to normal. It has only happened a couple of times in the past month I've owned this, so?Pre-installed software = I had to find workarounds to disable Bing and Microsoft Edge, but in the end I can now use the search box on the start bar and it opens Google results in Chrome. Those being my preferred search engine and web browser. It wasn't terribly difficult as an amateur tinkerer.Heat = Sometimes I use the laptop on my actual lap (go figure), and when I've been immersed in my addiction for 4-5 hours, it gets rather warm. Almost hot. The pre-installed Nitrosense app allows you to manage the fan settings in order to allay this. Also of note is that the heat escape is on the right side, which means south paws keep their leading hand cool and us orthodox boxers get a warm periodic reminder to move our hand away from the keyboard. In plain words: the heat from the fans blows directly where one would naturally rest one's hand on a mouse (if you use one, however, a mouse is not included).Keyboard = The keys are comfortably spaced, appropriately sensitive to touch, and all are in working condition. The value of the number pad on a laptop cannot be understated!! The red backlight on the keyboard by default times out after 30 seconds. Finding the right key to strike first on an all-black keyboard after the backlight turns off was obnoxious to me. After some searching, I found that this too is changeable in the Nitrosense app. Weird place to put it, but ok. Hit the ""(N)"" key in the top left of the number pad, then click the Settings gear inside Nitrosense, and click to toggle off the ""backlight off after 30 seconds"" option. This might not be available on every model, but take a gander.Battery life = The battery lasts for a decent amount of time when simply browsing and streaming music: several hours, give or take. But I prefer/recommend plugging in the power cord when I know I'm about to sit down for a long session of questing. (""Just one more quest!!"")Port/Cable management = Speaking of the power cable... It must have been a desperate decision to seat it on the righthand side of the laptop in the middle. The configuration of the internal hardware almost certainly has to be to blame for this. It seems like they tried to offset this inconvenience by making the power cable with a immediate 90 degree bend so you can swivel it (hopelessly) out of the way.Final summation = I listed things things that I believe could be improved which were mostly cosmetic in nature and were either adjustable or could be lived with. But on the whole, this laptop has been a game-changer for my usual activities and has truly been a ""best bang for your buck"" experience. I recommend it for anyone who is maybe moderately into gaming but mostly wants a very reliable and delightful experience.",0
"(In love with this ASUS machine): This is my second laptop, I was a desktop guy, my previous laptop an ASUS X542UF, excellent and reliable machine, I fall in love with the brand just because that one, and 3 years later was looking for an upgrade and another great experience.Once I notice this new OLED laptops generation and the amazing screen quality, I did't hesitate into go for it. The materials quality and everything on it looks fascinating.Last but not least, just because of this feedback, ASUS is giving us a 90 days warranty extension.The brand is rocking!!!?",0
(Very hot): Very Hot. CPU is running at 95c while playing games. Called ASUS support and they confirmed that it is not supposed to run at that temp. They offered to have me send it in for repairs. No thanks. I will return and buy something else.,0
the laptop is a great combination of light weight and performance,0
"(Screen dead one year after purchase): One year after purchasing, the screen on this laptop completely died. Have been told the internal wires were inappropriately or badly placed. The computer still works, but the screen doesn't. Was told it would take more money to repair than is worth it = cheaper to buy a new laptop. Completely unacceptable. Spent $1000. for ONE year. LEMON.",0
"(Excelente diseño con potencia.): Muy liviana, buena potencia como para usar cualquier software de Adobe, los videojuegos del momento a calidad medium y algunos en High.La bateria me parece buena (unas 5 hrs) para uso de ofimatica, navegar por internet, escuchar musica todo momento y el brillo al 80%.",0
(Three Stars): Slow when unbox and install a 2GB application thru internet.,0
"(... this computer for about 3 months now and really love it. I needed a professional laptop that could ...): I've been using this computer for about 3 months now and really love it. I needed a professional laptop that could handle the strain of freelance graphic design (rasterizing items in Illustrator, video editing, etc, everything adobe) and boy is this thing a powerhouse. I was using a custom upgraded 2010 macbook pro and it was having a hard time keeping up, fans constantly came on and the thing burned my lap it got so hot. This computer's fans are hardly noticeable, and hardly ever boot on. The speakers are PHENOMENAL, I love listening to music while I work and this has been a great addition to my workspace. I also use a second monitor and it looks great plugged into another screen. The viewing angles aren't the greatest, but you really can't beat what you get for the price. You can even get them custom built with more space at cukusa.com. All around great laptop so far.",0
"(Great computer!!!): This computer was recommended to me by an IT guy haha. I was babysitting his kid and casually was talking about gaming computers and he said this one was great for gaming on a budget. So far, it cools fast and easy, the graphics card is AMAZING for this price, the free headset offer is really great, and I love the light up keyboard for when I’m burning the midnight oil. It’s also excellent at running games and I’ve had no problems or lag. Thank you MSI!!!",0
(Computer was not as advertised.. Microsoft 10 Pro was not on it..): I had to completely reimage this computer. Some keys wouldn't work. And.. it came with Microsoft 10 HOME edition. Not PRO edition AS ADVERTISED AND PAID FOR.,0
(Not easy to apply): Not easy to apply. I still have bubbles that I can't get rid of in the corner. You'll have to be fairly experienced with applying these kind of things to get it perfect.,0
(Awesome Laptop! Best price/quality!): Really Nice laptop! The best one I found on the same level!,0
(Worth the money): Love it,0
"(I love this machine): My 10 year old gaming desktop was struggling with modern games and I decided to look into replacing it with a laptop. I work on my feet (@38 miles a week) and am in my late 50's, so sitting at my PC for hours had become uncomfortable and my feet would inevitably get cold from being stationary. This laptop is perfect for me. I LOVE gaming with my feet stretched out on the couch. It performs well with modern games and it hasn't required the cooling pad that I bought to accompany it. Instead, I prefer to use a lap desk on Amazon called ""Honey Can Do"". It's 23 inches wide and I have enough room for a small mouse. The laptop is hefty in weight but stays securely on the hard-topped, malleable-cushioned lap desk. I've moved the laptop + lap desk off my lap hundreds of times in the last year and have not have any accidents. It does require slower and more methodical movements though. I trained myself to place my thumbs on the sides of the laptop and my fingers under the edges of the lap-desk while transferring it anywhere. I've had it now 16 months and it's performed flawlessly for me. I use NZXT's temp monitors and it runs in the healthy range. The graphics and CPU speed are excellent. The speakers are not good but the sound is perfect when I use either a wireless or wired headset. The fans are loud but that's normal for any kind of gaming PC. The machine MUST be plugged in while gaming! I had a fantasy of playing on my outdoor patio set in the beautiful summer evenings but no, not doable. The games stutter and fps go down as fast as the battery charge does. Next year, I will buy a long extension cord. Just a note: the intake air vents underneath need frequent cleaning if you have a husky dog that sits beside you on the couch:)I am 100% pleased with this purchase. Great machine and great customer service too.",0
(Yes): Excellent,0
"not all of the body feels so solid, especially around the edges",0
this was a breeze to set up,0
Great size considering what it has packed inside .69 inches thick x 14” wide x 10” deep,0

(Didn't get a chance to operate. Came different than labeled): This was not a touchscreen unfortunately. Sad. Because that's not the description. It says multi touch screen.,0
(muy buen equipo): Su performance del equipo muy bueno,0
"(Nice weight, but the power isn't there.): As a hobby, I like to manipulate photographs. This is only slightly intensive. I use Adobe Photoshop and find that anything I do that requires a little processing, slows to a crawl. Sometimes the program even freezes. The laptop tends to get heated up quickly",0
(Very good product): Very good product,0
"(La mejor compra de mi vida!): Amo todo lo que sea Apple y sinceramente no me decepcionó, súper slim, rápida, es como traer tu iphone en mano! Simplemente la amo!",0
"(Great computer): Fast, solid feeling, real value.",0
(Good quality basic laptop for students!): Awesome basic laptop for university students doing absolutely basic typing and reports on MS Office and web browsing! It's so cheap and works great for all my student needs! Battery life is amazing! Used it for 3 days straight without a charge!,0
(Great Product): This is a great device if you want a nice compact little laptop to surf the web and enjoy streaming media.,0
(HP): It is the best laptop!!!,0
"(Maybe it was just the one I received. These are usually good laptops): The letters and space bar were sticking. I sent the product back, still no refund.",0
(Great buy): For my grandson,0
"(Great product.): I love this thing! It is great and does everything I need it to do.I think what people forget or don't understand is that this is a Chromebook. It is limited in what it is capable of and is not the same as a full laptop. Please understand that before you buy it or I am sure you will be disappointed. I use it for my writing, watching videos, browsing social media, and occasionally chatting with friends. I have other computers that can do any heavy lifting that this can't. Having said all that I am very happy with this and would highly recommend it and would make the purchase again.",0
"(love it): While it isn't literally a feature of this model, I'm thrilled to death with the fast boot and fast load of programs. This is the way to go. Never get a computer with a hard drive again. Forget 1 T hard drives; pointless in these days of cloud storage and USB sticks with 128 Gb of storage costing under $20.Haven't used the camera yet, and since I connect the laptop to a huge monitor and have wireless trackball and keyboard, don't use the fingerprint reader much, use a pin instead. But when I travel, the fingerprint reader worked just fine.Again, it may be common, but pleasantly surprised at the size and weight of the 'brick.' Which is the term for the transformer, and they used to weigh 4-5 lbs all by themselves. This brand should be bragging about that, because it's slightly larger than an iPhone transformer. When you travel, it's the weight of the whole setup, not just the computer, that matters. Computers without hard drives are lighter, boot in about 6 seconds, load Word or Excel in 5 seconds, not 20 seconds or more like hard drive computers.Because I love my trackball so much, I bring it along when I travel, so don't use the mousepad. In fact, if you type on the computer's keyboard, occasionally your wrist or a finger brushes the mousepad, making it do funny things like move the location of typing.I can travel through the control panel to turn off the mousepad, but strangely that setting doesn't stick. The next time I turn on the computer, mousepad is live again. When I turn on the computer I leave it on all day, so we're talking taking 30 seconds once a day to turn it off when I'm working in a hotel or on the couch, but it would be a tiny bit nicer if one of the F keys turned the mousepad on and off while leaving trackball or mouse live.That, however, is not a flaw of this computer, but of the whole laptop industry, which has standardized what F keys do.",0
"(Fast and reliable): I’m happy using my thinkpad laptop, it is working so good.",0
"(Hold my PS5. New Keyboard coming through.): got this laptop for Fathers Day and I love it! Not sure what issue previous reviewers had but all the specs match the listing, my wife and son picked good with this one!super easy setup process out of the box with a couple of updates needed but had no issues with that. 60hz refresh rate so we’ll see how that impacts my game play. not doing anything too crazy so I assume it’ll be fine.looked into more of MSI’s laptops after setting this one up and im already adding one of their bigger gaming units to my Christmas list!",0
"(and despite the wonderful computer, speed and very light): I receive yesterday, and despite the wonderful computer, speed and very light. the battery was not recognise by the computer. it means that I am returning back the computer. Hope the new one that I will get tomorrow can come correctly.",0
"(Great Little Laptop): This is a great little laptop. I used it primarily for writing and data entry on the bus. It's the perfect size for working on a lapdesk with no elbow room. The battery lasted, the system ran smooth, it was great. The screen does tend to develop a few bright spots.After the pandemic hit and I was no longer on the bus, I gave it to my mom. It's an ideal laptop for less tech-savvy folks that just want to browse the web, comment on political articles, like awkward Facebook photos, or watch Netflix in bed even though they couldn't get the remote to work.",0
(5-star terrific): I've been with PCs since IBM first unveiled it in Chicago at the SHARE conference. This is the fastest one I've ever owned. I bought it to replace an old Toshiba used for music and audio books. This notebook is too great to use for just that. Can't say enough good things about it.,0
(Restarts frequently by itself.): Worked very good with no issues for 1.5 years but now all of the sudden it restarts frequently by itself. it happened to be a common issue with Asus laptops. I am desperately seeking after sales service.,0
(Nice): Not bad. Was a gift. They liked it.,0
"(Good laptop): I am an engineering graduate student. This computer works as my everyday laptop. I heavily program on it and it works fine. The screen is good, the keyboard is good, the speaker is good. The only issue to me is that this laptop is not allowed us to upgrade ram by myself.",0
"(Acer Chromebook stopped working in less than 6 months.): After less than 6 months of normal use, my Acer Chromebook stopped powering up. I contacted Acer tech support via digital messaging and they guessed that it may be a power supply problem. They sent me a new one, but it did not correct the problem. I called them today (Thursday) and they want me to wait until after the weekend just to have instructions emailed to me on how to send the product back for repair. I would also need to pay for the shipping from NY to Texas. I am very disappointed with the product and support.",0
"(great little chromebook and she loves it): Bought for my 70 year old mother, works as it should, great little chromebook and she loves it.",0
"(Good for everyday use.): The shipping was a little scary, I didnt think I was going to receive it all, and the order updated and it was delivered the next day. That being said this thing is great. Started right up and immediately connected to the internet. Screen quality is good. For the price you really cant go wrong. It may not last as long as others, or it may! Who knows but for $200 you're getting a good deal. For at home everyday use? Checking emails, YouTube, ETC this is a perfect buy.",0
"(LOVE IT!): My previous laptop just up and died with the blue screen of death. I had purchased the same brand - ASUS - for my father back at Xmas and he loves his. Super fast, great screen resolution, plays movies and music with great picture and sound, different model, his is a 15"".So I got myself one.This is fantastic! I might eventually add more memory, but what's on here is more than I need. It did come with the 'linkage' you need internally to add more memory.I don't game, so can't answer that question for anyone, and mine is NOT a touch screen (thank god!).Picture is super clear, good crisp colors. If you do graphic design and such, can't speak to that.Sounds are great, no echo or tiny qualities.Screen goes all the way to the edge!!!I don't have a problem with the keyboard color, yes it is just a few shades darker than the keys themselves, but it is back lit which helps. I type for a living so if you hunt and peck to type - this is not going to be for you.The power button over on the top right of the 10-key pad is a nice placement.The way the lid slides under the base gives it just that perfect ergonomic lift that really helps with typing.Plenty of ports for things, power plug is very low profile and unobtrusive (and long!).I surf the net, watch movies and youtube, work in a chat feature (like Teams). Pretty boring. But this suits all of my needs and then some.Setting up the internet was super easy.The only minor minor minor draw back is a lack of CD/DVD component, BUT - you can get an external CD/DVD drive for next to nothing and plug it in with a USB.If you just need a good basic work horse laptop and some extra oomph - this is a sure ticket to get.Would I recommend it for children, college students? Absolutely.Add more memory or an external drive if your college student is working in astrophysics, computer coding or a medical program and you're set!Will absolutely buy this brand again.",0
"(Fantastic Laptop): 5/5 stars great laptop, runs warm but thats to be expected with these specs, however the power brick gets waayyyy hotter than ive ever seen before, unsure if thats normal for these or not.",0
"I bought this computer because I wanted a professional-looking, portable, and light gaming/CUDA-capable laptop",0
(First time having a laptop and it helped me set it up really easily.): Awesome i bought a 32 inch screen with it and it runs any game perfectly.,0
"(Great for productivity, not for games): I had a really good experience drawing on this and reading comics. Also really liked the form factor and thinness. Unfortunately there is a cooling issue when playing games, even 2D ones that it should not have a problem with. It's unfortunate because this has a Geforce video card in it. I returned it due to the heating issue.",0
(Five Stars): Best PC,0
(Waste of time and money): This is the worst laptop you can possibly by. Out of the box it struggles to open basic Windows application let alone internet browsers. You'd be better off burning the money you would've spent for warmth.,0
it would've been great if it came with the Ethernet USB dongle and the USB type C charger,0
"This is a toy, and not even a good one at that",0
"(Buena): Apresar de que fue enviada por Amazon EUA llegó un día antes de lo esperado y en muy buenas condiciones. La computadora es buena, pero hasta ahí. Por los 10k que pagué estoy satisfecho para un uso en casa y/o de tipo oficina. La adquirí debido a la necesidad actual para que mi hijo pueda realizar su escuela a distancia.Es rápida por su SSD, aunque es de 128 y sólo tienes disponibles alrededor de 80GB está perfecto para la escuela u oficina.Enciende en menos de 10 segundos, teclado retroiluminado, varios puertos USB de diferentes características, HDMI. Los altavoces son débiles y con muy poca definición; podría decir que suena igual que el altavoz de mi celular pero, cumple para lo que se necesita. La batería tiene una duración aceptable dentro de 4-6 horas dándole un uso ofimático.Por 10k no pienso que exista algo mejor, ya que viene con un procesador Intel Core i3 de 10ma generación y 128SSD (80 libres, ya lo aclaramos).",0

"(I do not recommend buying acer computers): I bought this computer for my friend.it took him 1 month to arrive and I was impatient to give it to him when he arrived. the computer was running slowly, I could only open 2 tabs through chrome. I tried to solve the situation first. I spoke to acer in my country and they said they weren't interested. I told Amazon about this situation, and they asked me to fix it and tell them how much the fee costs. I somehow solved the problem, but the problem happened to me again. acer officials said there was a problem with the device's graphics card. I asked what I could do for the defective product. unfortunately, no one could help because I bought it from another country.I contacted ups and dhl to ship the product to Amazon. they asked for more money than Amazon could afford. currently, I have shipped the product with a local shipment, and the product will arrive in Amazon in 1 month. I'm ashamed of my friend. we had to wait for his money to be refunded so he could buy a computer again. I do not recommend buying acer computers from outside the United States .",0
(Satisfied): It operated when I turned it on,0
(Great computer): The product was exactly what I wanted.,0
(exactly what i wanted): excellent! lightweight.,0
"(Light and easy to travel with!): Love everything about this, except for no backlit keyboard. I think I like it better than my Yoga 730 13.3""! Although the text on the 730 is crisper for some reason (even though they're same resolution screen). The fan on this 720 hardly ever comes on after the BIOS update and all the Windows 10 updates. Two thumbs up!!",0
(Buen producto): La lap está muy bonita solo que me desespera que el teclado viene diferente aveces no encuentro algunos caracteres ... Y no sé cómo cambiar la configuración 100%al espa?ol,0
"(Recibi lo que esperaba): Todo perfecto hasta ahora! La lapptop es preciosa! Aun no la exploté al máximo. Sus puertos uds son algo ajustados, cuesta retirar lo que uno conecta.",0
(Portable desktop): Basically a portable gaming desktop. It has nearly no battery life but that is due to the beast of a machine inside. It more than compares to most desktops of today. I'm not even aware that it has a touch screen if it does y would I care. For the size screen it is very good.. it could be higher res but it would lose something if it were. I use it when away from home.. I plug it in.,0
"(I am impressed!): This is a fast,, responsive device. Good screen, of easily readable size. which appears to have a non glare feature.. Google and Acer have teamed up nicely.",0
(Bien para empezar): Bien,0
(Crombook is worth the money.): I did not need to buy Microsoft word. There is an app for PowerPoint.,0
(I like Lenovo but get a solid state drive): Hard drive already showing signs of failure,0
(Asus rocks): Good quality. Good for entry level to mid level gaming laptop. Able to run Gears of War 5 without any issues.,0
"(Great entry+ gaming laptop): I bought this laptop to dip my toes in the water for PC gaming and also to use as a personal PC for emails, browsing the web, etc. I used a separate monitor as I wasn't using this as a mobile gaming set-up. The version I got with the i7 and 3060 laptop GPU was great for warzone. I was able to run well above standard graphics on Warzone at about 100FPS. I never had any issues with overheating, although I did buy a cheap ""fan deck"" to put the laptop on. The fan isn't quiet, but that is to be expected with any gaming laptop, especially when under stress. I have since bought a full gaming desktop as I realized I did want to fully make the jump from console to PC but I gave this laptop to my wife who plays the Sims and Age of Empires and she has seen HUGE performance boosts compared to her older Asus Nitro 5. Her games run much smoother on this laptop. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get into pc gaming or someone that is looking for a multi-use portable PC. Be sure to check the specs and reviews for the specific model you're buying as Amazon shows reviews for similar pcs with different internal specs.",0
"(Good looking bur you can install software!): Good looking computer. Very nice for the price BUT if you plan to use it as your primary computer, it is not a good fit. You cannot install software and everything is chrome based!",0
First one I received the laptop battery didn’t work properly,0
"(Best value for the Graphics card, MSI reliability): I've had this for about two months now. I'm really happy with it.Cheapest RTX 2070 laptop I could find. That's what I'm paying for, is a nice display and the solid graphics card. This is probably the best computer I've ever bought. If you're looking for a solid gaming-able laptop that isn't the absolute top tier, this is it!!I heavily recommend a cooling fan pad/stand, it will greatly increase airflow and keep your laptop cool and less noisy.The GL65 leaopard is 100 dollars cheaper than the GP65 leopard solely because the case is made of plastic and not aluminum. Fine by me, I don't plan on hauling this thing around, and I routinely clean fingerprints, so they don't bother me at all.MSI comes with their Dragon Center dashboard, which will show you CPU, memory, SSD usage and intenral temperatures. It will also allow you to control the keyboard LEDs, and set battery charge intervals. I like this dahsboard.The keyboard backlit LEDs are gorgeous.Bulky, but not particularly heavy. But this is expected of any laptop with a beefy (non-slim design) graphics card. I don't mind this, it mostly stays on my desk.Early wear on keyboard letters: The keys are clear plastic to show the LEDs, and are painted to show the letters ans symbols. This paint seems cheap and is already starting to fade through two months in.Trackpad click feels fragile. But who cares? Most gaming folks will use a mouseOnly 3 USB ports, you may need an adapter.I'm only concerned about the hinge system. I know this is a standard for MSI, but this mechanical part looks small, I'd hate for this wear and tear to break computer.Screen is matte and no glare means I can see nicely.I like having a number pad too!I'm willing to sacrifice a little on the SSD size for the great graphics card. To me, 500GB is plenty, I have external drives for any massive storage I may need.",0
"(Touchpad stopped working after a month and a half.): the computer its great , easy to use, material looks good but not very durable, the touch pad stopped working in less than two month, i am stuck with this laptop, can only use it with a wireless mouse., the fix is so expensive to does not worth it paying to fix it",0
(Couldn't be happier with it): This thing packs a serious punch. It has handled everything I've thrown at it without issue. I honestly have no complaints at all.If I absolutely had to choose something it'd be the battery life. It lasts maybe 2-3 hours even with the system just sitting idle. Personally not an issue with me because anywhere I plan to use it there is an available outlet to plug into.Other than that everything is great.,0
"(Don't buy this laptop): I buyed this laptop few months ago. The battery life this below 2 hours, yes, only 2 hours, and for activities like wacht a netflix or browser the web. The touch pad and the usb port did't work for some lapse of time.I really dissapoint with this laptop, I live abroad EEUU so warranty it's no available.",0
"(Quite Disappointed): I had like this laptop at first but after just a year of usage, the fan stopped working, cracks everywhere and touchpad buttons are too loose. the shell feels like cheap material and it scratches easily.",0
(Junk): I had this machine less than a week when the boot sequence wouldnt launch. Got errors all the time. Mostly due to corruption of files because the machine over heated. In addition to the errors after having it for less than a few days I get an error saying my memory was full?I returned the item the next day.,0
"(Really content with my laptop!): I was very hesitant on buying a Lenovo laptop because the last laptop I bought from them was horrible. Granted, I did buy one of the cheaper ones (it was a years ago when i purchased it but i was under $700 for sure) so I guess i got what I paid for. My issue with the previous laptop was that it was incredibly slow.That is not the case with this laptop at all!Intro: All I use my laptop for is for personal use-- Netflix, Microsoft Word, Excel for personal financing, Facebook, amazing shopping, Hulu, checking email, and storing all my pictures/videos.PROS: Finger print scanner works well. No complaints on that. Its pretty fast. I haven't had an issue on the speed. Volume can go pretty loud if needed. When watching my shows on Hulu, i did not notice any fuzziness with the audio. There's bluetooth so I am able to connect my airpods! There's cool little features like being able to light up the keyboard (just the top keys), and flip the laptop into tablet mode. I only really use touch screen when in tablet mode and there's no lagging or anything like that.CONS: The battery life is okay. Nothing out of this world. I've charged my laptop with it off for 3+ hours once, and it only went up to 99%. I feel like the battery runs pretty fast also.The way the keyboard is set up, i find myself accidentally pressing the Caps Lock button a lot which can be irritating at times.",0
(2018 acer chromebook beter than i expected): this laptop exceeded my expectations.,0
(Buen precio por el producto): Cumple con lo que se requiere; buena apuesta por el precio.,0
"(It's ok.): This is a small light laptop, I needed a new one after my clunky Toshiba was running slow, and getting outdated. I wanted a light, fast and small laptop, which this is, but the battery life stinks, face recognition stinks, does not always detect and the touch screen often freezes the whole laptop.Likes, fast, light, easy to set upDislikes, battery life, touch screen glitches.",0
The battery goes pretty quickly,0
"(Nice laptop, but beware of faulty Acer product construction): Bought this laptop with some graduation money. I loved the look and features, but I noticed it wouldn't go to sleep when the lid closed.This is a minor issue but I wasn't going to just ""deal with it."" I paid almost $1k for this thing, and I needed it to freaking work right. Got the replacement ordered, and after a bit more troubleshooting I discovered that the spacebar was protruding just enough to be pressed when the lid closed.So in short, I couldn't have fixed it anyway due to it being a hardware issue. Anyways, I've gotten the replacement set up and I'm loving it.This thing is so light that it doesn't feel like it should have the components it contains (i7-1165G7 w/ Iris Xe IGPU).It runs Apex legends on medium to low settings with few hiccups, but be sure to put it on a flat surface to account for adequate cooling.Battery life is incredible due to the Intel Evo energy management system, I haven't stress-tested it yet, but I have a lot of confidence that it won't disappoint.When I say this thing is snappy, I mean incredibly fast, at almost any task. (hehe, rhymes) The 16GB of 4267MHz LPDDR4X RAM is a major contributor to that speed. The PCI Express NVME SSD feels like it's supercharged and overclocked; it's that fast. And the 1TB capacity gives me ample wiggle room for whatever files or games I might want to store on it.Camera is an underwhelming 720p pinhole lens, so nothing really to fawn over there.The fingerprint sensor is super helpful as well. You can use it to sign in to websites as well as the laptop itself.Overall, very happy with the laptop so far, but I was disappointed that the first one I got was faulty. Points docked, Acer. I would definitely recommend this to someone who needs a powerful laptop that doesn't take up much space.As an added bonus, it has a pretty snazzy color scheme as well. The subtle green with the bronze/gold accents really goes well together in my opinion. The only downside is that these colors are the only ones available.Hope to use it for years to come!",0
"(buena relacion calidad precio para trabajar y jugar.): La uso para trabajo y algun juego como Fornite, rinde muy bien en ambos casos.De ser unicamente para lo ultimo en juegos, puede que necesite mas disco, para tener varios instalados.Mi hijo tiene la misma con Ryzen 7 4800 y placa 1660ti de 6gb y anduvo tan bien que un a?o despues compramos esta.Maquina de sobra para un usuario promedio.",0

(Thx): Perfect,0
"(Touchpad broke within 2 months.): I can't make any comment about screen quality, gaming, or battery life because this device literally broke on me.",0
"(Bang for your buck): Been looking for a decent mid to higher tier option for gaming on the go since my living situation is temporary for the time being. I haven't had any issues running any game on high or max settings and the SSD is more then enough to make a huge difference in terms of load times and speed. Going from an old rustbucket frankenstein of a desktop that barely worked, this is worth every penny. There are of course pros and cons with this like anything else.Pros+Exceptionally fast, especially for a laptop+Fairly lightweight+Dragon Center is pretty good for controlling the fans+Can play pretty much anything on high or max settings+VR Ready!+Very slick and stylish designCons-552 SSD really sucks and can be a deal breaker for some-Can get really hot if you run it over a period of a number of hours which is why theres settings for the fans-When it has to cool down the fans get super loud, not an issue for me because I have headphones but some mics will pick up the fans-Very few usb slots, I remedied this with a hub I already had thankfully-Keyboard takes a bit to get used toOverall if you're looking for a pretty good laptop for the price, I highly recommend this. Of course getting a gaming desktop whether prebuilt or you build your own is definitely the better option in the long run but this is good for folks like me that don't have a permanent residence yet.",0
(I've owned this for a few days now and I'm seriously impressed.): I will likely update this review or add another one in a few months time but my first impressions of the laptop are that it's very fast reliable and can run modern games in high settings. Of course any good gaming laptop owner will have a cooling pad which always helps performance. Before this laptop I owned a Lenovo l340 GTX 1650 which I loved. PS this laptop goes great with the Lenovo gaming mouse. Flawless cpmbination,0
(Not used to chrome book. Used to windows): I don’t use it for gaming so I can’t really judge it that well. And I didn’t realize it was a touchscreen I’ll have to try that.,0
"(Please Read Before You Buy!): Please do not buy this product and support HP and their defective designs!I own this laptop and got it on sale for a very good price. Even still I did not get the product I was really promised.First, I'll start off with the positive. As a general use laptop for web surfing and office work it is fine. The 5400rpm hard drive is VERY slow though. You can install a SSD into the laptop though and it will be much faster, it also has a second memory slot so you can get dual-channel ram if yours does not come configured that way.So, this laptop is VERY fast for general usage and spreadsheets and work related tasks if that's what you do with it.The issue is that it's a crippled product and many people buy the 2500u to play games and use the graphics end of the chip, the Vega 8. The Vega 8 in this laptop is configured to run at 12Watts! Below the minimum 15W that AMD has officially. It also runs at 25W and 45W in different applications.Go online and search videos for 2500u 15w vs 25w vs 45w and look at the performance difference.If you attempt to play games on this like others have mentioned the product throttles itself down and overheats. The GPU is supposed to run at 1100mhz, but it gets so hot so fast that it can't clock itself over 450-500mhz after a few minutes of playing and your framerate takes a huge dive. HP also prevents you from allocating anything more than 1GB of memory to the chip in the BIOS.As other posters mentioned you can Google AMD STAPM and learn to disable it, but even that won't fix the problem on this laptop. Yes, disabling STAPM will unlock the wattage to the chip and allow it to pull more power, the issue is once the chip hits a certain temperature >75C it will begin to downclock anyway.The cooling capability of this laptop simply is not capable of keeping the chip cool at 100% usage. Period. At the end of the day this is a sub 300 laptop. So, just spend the extra 100 and get one that's designed properly.",0
"(You get what you pay for.): This laptop comes with a moderately small SSD drive and 4 GB of RAM. The RAM is the minimum requirement for Windows 11 and it shows. Just after boot with no apps running the RAM is at 90% in use.Start running Teams or a browser or an Office app and you are pegging the memory and you will notice the cpu being pegged and slowish responses. But like I said, you get what you pay for, this is a computer designed to have the minimum specs unless you upgrade.The screen is fine, setting it up was fine and the only issues I had with installing things were due to Windows 11 and the Windows Store not wanting to install non Microsoft apps. I installed my own Office from work and ran Teams.If you want a very inexpensive laptop for doing minimal work this will suffice.",0
(Good product): Good,0
"(Loss for words): Had mine since April and I gotta tell you, I’m literally lost for words. I won’t make this length cause I don’t have to, all you need to know is that this is a must have for anyone wanting to get productivity and entertainment out of a laptop.",0
"(Good with some cons...): Good laptop- powerful (i9 /3070 ti),- good quality,- good sound,- good screen,- nice keyboard except for PrintScreen key which is very misplace - too close from right arrow.but:- massive and heavy 180W external charger - even for a such powerful laptop...- lot of issues with a fresh reinstall even with all Asus drivers installed. => 23 drivers to install, => powercfg /energy issues, => online support almost useless, got only one reply... ""Reinstall"",- sleeping mode is difficult and still always draining ~ 10 - 15 Watts,- useless Keystone - A security key would have been more appropriate,- and always warm on the legs...I'm coming from Gigabyte Aorus 15XD (3070) that I returned it because shift keys were not backlit and the Aorus had better performance on CyberPunk 2077 benchmark with ""only"" an 3070, heated less and had no drivers issues with a fresh reinstall...So my opinion is therefore mixed...---Update:Move my review from 3 to 4 stars.=> powercfg /energy issues are not coming from ASUS but from Microsoft (Windows 11)=> online support is difficult but if you insist you will have a better reply",0

"(Good School/Mild Gaming): I love the way this computer looks I am a huge fan!, I bought this for the use of school and some light gaming and it looks like this would be one of the best purchases ever. The graphics are awesome!.",0
"(Ubuntu Mate perfect for the hardware.): Bought this pc with the intent of installing a lightweight linux distro on it. When I received it, I spent 10 min playing around on it and found windows 10 to be slow. After some research, I installed Ubuntu Mate on it and it works like a peach! After installation there was about 20 Gb of free space and all the functions worked (bluetooth, web cam, hdmi port, ect.) . Its a lightweight distro that still carries alot of functions. However, do you research and install at own risk. Might not work/be for everyone.",0
"(Great Gaming Laptop!): Used for gaming and personal home use. This laptop gets the job done at a lower cost. I play CyberPunk, The Witcher, Forza Horizon, Dying Light, Battlefield series at high settings and no problems. When gaming at high settings the internal fans are a bit loud but I don't mind. I bought a laptop cooler just to ensure there is no overheating during heavy game play.",0
(Good gaming laptop): This is a pretty good laptop for the price. It has run every game I've tried well. Would recommend,0
"(Excelente equipo): Satisfecho, aún estoy probando y hasta ahora cumple las expectativas.",0
(Does not work): It will not charge or start up. They sent it that way now I have to send it for repair and wait to see if it can even be fixed a waste of time and money,0
"(Need and external cooling pad): Its an HP and another one that the fans are not working and it is getting hot. The vents are on the bottom of the computer, therefore no where to breath. I just bought a fan cooler Kyolly cooling pad to go with it and it is doing the job. I also have an extended warranty on this computer because I had an HP in the past with a cooling problem. I will not be returning it and not talking to the company because the external fans are doing the job. Sometimes you can get a download to make internal fans work but not sure if that is the problem.As for the computer functions it is fast starts up fast and I like it. The only thing I did not like is it automatically changed all my documents from my old computer to my new. So keep that in mind when you purchase your new computer for memory purposes. Also one drive is still full and that is one reason I purchased a new one. So I will have to get a different cloud source.",0
(Ordinateur): Il est super . Rien d’autre a rajouter,0
"(Apple has done it again! LOVE IT!!!!): The MacBook Air is an amazing machine! I absolutely love it!!! I only wish that it had more ports on it. Not a huge deal because I bought a hub for more ports, but would have been nice to see more ports on this thing. Other than that, I love how responsive it is, and I love the picture quality! Also, the battery life on this thing is unreal!!! I have left it off the charger for well over a week and have not needed to charge it. It is amazing!!!",0
"(BAD BATTERY LIFE): This machine has an indredible power but the battery life it's just useless. I have just fully charged my computer and the estimate of the battery time remaining is 45min. I thought it was just a problem, and the estimate was not accurate but the battery is really going down really fast, in 8 min the computer went from 100% to 75%. I don't if my machine came with a problem but for me it just does not works.",0
"(Beautiful Hardware, Full of bloat): 5 stars if Microsoft would quit filling their OS with junk programs from 3rd parties. The hardware is exceptional. From the size, through the feel of the touch-pad, to the screen everything is beautifully crafted.",0
(Long lasting battery!): Works great for school,0
"(Great Laptop): Very easy to set up, fast, lightweight, operates well",0
"(Runs hot, unreliable, expensive repairs, noisy motherboard): This longtime Dell customer is very disappointed by this product. My XPS 13 runs hot even under moderate usage, and the motherboard makes a hissing noise while plugged in. Even though I basically never move my laptop and use it gently, after less than 2 years of usage this laptop experienced major electrical problems. Dell took 6 weeks to repair (much longer than promised) and return my laptop, costing almost $400 (also higher than promised), and replacing seemingly half the system including the motherboard, battery, screen, speaker and more. Customer support didn't provide me with timely and accurate estimates of repair status and repair time. They failed to call when they said they would and instead called late in the evening. I generally found technical support unfriendly, unskilled, and unable to make things right.It just isn't worth the aggravation. Maybe buy an Lenovo or HP instead, as they seem to have better reliability according to LaptopMag.",0
"(Seriously the best gaming laptop you could ask for this price.): Just to be certain, this is the Ryzen 7 4800H processor 16GB ram ddr4 and 512 SSD - I put a 1TB ssd in it m.2 - the 144fps IPS screen is soo nice! 1660 TI handles anything ive thrown at it!! its beautiful!! buy it",0
(The mouse button): Battery is going down quickly.,0
"(Powerful, Portable, And Just What You'd Expect (Great!)): i use this laptop for gaming and it performs just as you'd expect it to. the RTX 2070 is a powerful card that runs just about anything you could hope for. Not only is it for gaming, the processing speed and SSD allow for speedy surfing through multiple tabs and the file explorer. I do a lot of art and manage a few accounts, so being able to multitask so many programs at once is just what I needed.Pros:- Fast computing and read/write speed- Powerful GPU that can run Dota2, LoL, Warcraft, Borderlands, etc.- Comes without bloatware installed (except for Norton security...)- Very lightweight and easy to transportCons:- The fan is a little loud, but it doesn't matter if you're listening to music or a game. You won't hear it then.- Comes with Norton Security installed. Just wipe it off completely and install something better.- Power supply brick is heavy, but it should be expected. Not much of a con.Overall, it was much harder trying to think of cons about this laptop than it was listing all of the great positives. If you know computers and computer statistics, then you can expect this laptop to perform as it should, which is fantastic. If you're just looking for a mid-high range laptop that can handle pretty much anything and excel at gaming, then this is an excellent choice.",0

Never heard a complaint from her about it.I'm in software development, and yes, this can easily be used for that as well. When we first got the laptop, I spent about an hour and a half to reset the computer to bare Win10 with no ""extra"" bloat. This could be the reason the laptop is so fast (never ran it stock from the manufacturer so couldn't give you a comparison).Overall, extremely happy with the laptop. Would recommend",0
It does come pre-loaded with a lot of bloatware,0
Self-healing surface to reduce the damage from light scratches,1
"(Dependability): This was the second time I purchased this chrome book. Last was was several yrs old. I like it so I bought the same one and recieved it the end of February. Recently, the beginning of May I used it in the morning and it was fine. Later I turned it on and had some difficulty with the screen being distorted. There was no physical damage to my laptop and know reason why it should have an issue. I Contacted support who recommended sending my Samsung Chrome book to them for diagnostic repair. They recieved it and can fix it for a charge and claiming it is not covered under warranty. I had it less than three months and due to no fault of my own it does not work . I have always purchased Samsung products but will no longer. A very disappointed and dissatisfied customer.",0
"(Really Disappointing Performance): Have had this laptop for a few weeks and am disappointing in its shortcomings.1) it's just not that fast. For all the fancy specs, I'm not noticing much better performance than the 5 year old MacBook air I was replacing. This is brand new, out of the box, the bloatware deleted and a very light antivirus.2) internet runs unbelievably slowly. All my other devices work great on my Wifi, but this thing clocks glacial speeds (slower than my phone on or off Wifi). Updated all the drivers, fiddled with network settings. All to no avail. This is the deal breaker for me.3) speakers. are. trash. So quiet I can't even hear dialogue in shows. When I ""boost"" with an extension to my browser, music and speech are garbled (like the speakers are blown out). You'd think the advertised Harman / Kardon hardware it would be better4) webcam looks like you're filming on a 10 year old flip phone.The battery life is pretty nice, the thing runs quiet (never notice the fan) and it's light and portable. But it really just doesn't do the job. I wanted to get past the budget-brand Asus nameplate and believe in the power advertised ""under the hood"" but unfortunately I'm going to have to get something ""fancier"" and less spec-ed out, probably back to a Mac.",0
"Once it crashed and blue screened on me when I afk (I was doing nothing with it, literally nothing) with the above error code.",0

"(It is extremely slow and over heats really fast.): Computer is large, heavy, slow and gets hot really fast. Every single time I try to stream something that I already have downloaded, it freezes up and lags.

Will definitely be returning this and trying to find a better one.",0
"When down loading something, or when you are swipe up and down the menu, you can hear annoying sound.",0

"(Very slow and constantly freezes or restarts): I use this computer for gaming and programming. It constantly freezes during my games and is very slow during programming. Sometimes, it freezes when I am in a zoom meeting and occasionally when I am just on chrome watching Youtube. Recently, it started to restart every time I close my computer. Before that, it would just take a few minutes to log in, but now t takes a few minutes to log in and a few more minutes to open the apps I need and close everything that automatically pops up. I would recommend you to spend a little bit more money for a better computer. If you will not game or code, then just get a cheaper computer or a chromebook.",0
"(Read the Negative Reviews Before Purchasing): If you read the negative reviews, you will see that this computer has problems. The Wi-Fi keeps dropping and you have to dig deep into the computer to restore it to only have it occur a day later. Also, the screen size is small and if you are older, it will be hard to read unless you bump the document size up. You should also know that if you do have the Wi-Fi problem with the computer and return it within the timeframe that Amazon sets, the seller will charge you a 20% restocking fee.",0

You can use Google docs; however, you can’t use any word processing applications unless you’re connected to the internet. It also lacks certain familiar keys on the keyboard, so you will need to Google the keyboard shortcuts. The Chromebook was frustrating to me. Thank goodness Amazon let me return it!",0

"(Great laptop for me!): I don't do a lot of gaming, but it's great for Microsoft 365, email and shopping. The only issue I have is how light the words on the keyboard are. Until I learned where the 'end' key was, for instance, I struggled to see it. Still it's a great lightweight unit and I am very happy with it.",0
"(Laptop Gamer): Excelente Laptop, Hermosa, con un gran nivel de performance, muy versatil, excelente para trabajar y para jugar. Encantando con el producto.",0

(Amazing Computer): This is a great laptop! Very fast and reliable with amazing graphics. I have been running demanding games and it runs flawlessly. I would highly recommend!,0
"(Great price for what you are getting in a gaming laptop!): I mulled over many different gaming laptops in the $1200 to $1600 range, but I kept coming back to the MSI GL 65 Leopard (my first MSI purchase). I did not want to buy any other brands and model except for this one because of the CPU (i7 10750h), GPU (GeForce RTX 2070), and 144hz screen that this comes with. There's nothing close to this price with this CPU and GPU. The screen is vivid and sharp. As a bonus, the keyboard has good response to it when typing and I like the color customization to the color of the keyboard keys. I also like the fan speed option because it is pretty loud when turned up but I was really impressed the silent mode option which keeps the laptop quiet for the operations I have used it with (surfing, videos, games (Sim, RTS, Strat, MMO, RPG, but not FPS). In addition to the 3 usb ports, there is 1 USB C port as well which is a need for me. Keep in mind that on this laptop, the fan vents blow out in the rear left and right and also the back left side as well so keep those area clear. The AC plug is located in the middle of the right side which some may not like , but it doesn't bother me one bit. Overall I am quite happy with this purchase.A drawback to this laptop is that it comes with only a 512gb m.2 SSD, but I was able to add an additional 2tb SATA SSD to it.",0
Color Quality is great and can change the tones of the screen with the MSI Center.,0

(Great price): Great computer especially for the price of $599. Boots so fast. Not a ton of space if games but there are slots for additional hard drives. I already added a tb hard drive (Sabrent Rocket Q 1TB NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 Internal SSD High Performance Solid State Drive R/W 3200/2000MB/s). I plan to add RAM at some point,0
"(... a year and I have to say it's way better than windows): I've had this laptop for about a year and I have to say it's way better than windows, no errors, no crashes, and no overheating. I game, stream and full on abuse my CPU yet this laptop still keeps going with no lag, a good buy for college or just personal use.",0

(Excelente producto 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻): Omg súper bien,0
This laptop is super portable and priced well,0
"(Some good, some disappointments): After much research, I finally decided to purchase this laptop. The main deciding factors were that there are actual buttons on the touchpad, the screen brightness, the video card, and the colorful keyboard. I am happy with the screen brightness. On my previous laptop (a dell), I would find myself trying to turn up the brightness only to find it was at 100%. I do not have that problem with this laptop. I also hated the power cord on the dell. It would fall out, all the time, since the first week I owned it. This cord has a nice 90 degree angle, so it stays out of the way, and it is actually hard to pull out, so I have no worries about it falling out mid game again. And this is a great laptop for games. My dell would get hot fast and overheat if I played too long, and the fans were loud and clicky (like something was stuck in it, but there wasn't). This one has loud, but less annoying fans, and the GPU stays around 86 when playing Modern Warfare.The things that really annoy me though, are the touchpad and the keyboard lights. I read one review about the touchpad buttons being loud, but never saw it demonstrated in a review video. I wish I had. My husband has actually asked if I could stop using the buttons because they are so loud and annoying. I considered returning this the first day because I was so disappointed with the buttons compared to every other touchpad button I have ever had. And then the second day when I was going through the color options with the steelseries button, and it stopped working. Got stuck on the yellow scrolling option. I had to reboot the computer to be able to change the colors again. I have had this problem four more times so far in the past month. It doesn't effect performance, but still very frustrating when it was one of the swaying factors. The button is also very hard to press, it is so low and small I actually have to use my fingernail to push it because my fingertip is too big (and I have small hands).If you managed to make it through this rambling review, I hope it helps!",0
"(Very nice but the trackpad): Received my laptop yesterday and it is very nice, easy to set up. Very big! Only this morning did I notice the trackpad is off center from both the screen and the keyboard. Not even centered under the space bar. … Transitioning from a more rational design where things are centered makes it difficult not to continually right-click. Yes, this design is clearly visible in the pictures, I just didn’t notice. If this is a deal breaker for you, now you might notice! As for me, I’m sure I will adapt in a few days.",0
(Great product easy to upgrade): Great product for the price,0
(cool): cool,0
"(Runs Steam like a Champ): Love the laptop, very nice quality feel. Laptop runs Steam games like a Boss. Just don't try to game on battery alone, when the system is cranking in game mode it smashes the battery charge in about an hour. When not gaming and just watching Netflix or web browsing you get a much better battery charge play time. Just a nice all around laptop, great at playing the games I love and stunning screen display for the graphics and Netflix nights!",0
"(útil para jugar): Buena computadora , aunque no tiene mucha memoria",0
"(Overall Good): This laptop has a lot of great features like the low price, quality screen, and backlit keyboard. The only bad-ish thing, which is probably a me thing, is the mousepad has a slight tactile feedback built into it using horizontal ridges that feels bad on my fingers.",0
"(Not windows 10, but windows 10 s mode): Advertised as Windows 10, but when I turned it on it actually had Windows 10 s mode installed.",0
"(PERFECTO!): Yo me compré la versión que viene con i3, al principio estaba dudoso de comprarla primero por la marca, ya que luego Acer tiene algunas laptops malas y la laptop se venía inglés (es decir, no cuenta con letra ?) pero viendo las especificaciones y que realmente el uso que le voy a dar a la laptop es para trabajo, escolar y ver videos es que me convencí a comprarla y resultó ser mejor de lo que esperaba... Los materiales de la laptop se sienten de muy buena calidad, el feeling del trackpad y las teclas son buenas, el teclado es retroiluminado(a mí me ayuda mucho porque suelo utilizarlo en lugares de poca luz) y bien, la duración de batería es mala, por todas las demás especificaciones es que aún con la mala duración de batería vale la pena comprarla.",0
(Using anytime anywhere): Granddaughter loves it!!,0

It has a good angle of vision and you do not se pixels.,0
(Computer Effiency): Excellent Computer - Easy to use,0
(Wonderful item): I love everything concerning this item,0
"(Refurb is worth it!): I was unsure of purchasing a refurb, but have been completely satisfied with this laptop. Starting up a new business, and needed a separate PC for that, and spending as little as possible for something that would work was important at the time. This laptop is lightweight, clean, no dings or scratches or sticky keys... everything I need to work, does! I use this for email/internet, Word, Excel, etc., no serious gaming or anything like that, so I can't evaluate those needs, but for what I need, this has been perfect!",0
"(Garbage product and terrible customer service): I bought 2 of these over the summer for distance learning - I have 2 similarly aged kids who are on video calls for school 3 hours a day, usually simultaneously. The headphone jacks are defective - they rarely, and only intermittently, recognize when headphones are plugged in. Sometimes restarting the whole system will help, but not always. I've tried 3 sets, so it's obviously a hardware issue. I suspect it's a build defect, not a QC issue, since it's happening on both machines. Even when we need to use the external speakers, those are terrible, too - my kid can barely hear his teacher even hovered over the keyboard with the volume turned up to 100. What a total waste of money.",0
(Three Stars): No parental controls. Had to return.,0
"(Excelente relación calidad precio.): Es un excelente equipo, una buena relación precio-beneficio, muy buen sistema de anfriamiento.",0
"(Salió defectuosa y por lo visto es un problema común): El touchpad dejó de funcionar durante la primera semana de uso. En un inicio no daba problemas ni en Windows ni en Linux, pero investigando me di cuenta de que es un problema relativamente común con esa pieza.Lamentablemente es un producto de importación y si se hace la devolución el dinero que pagué por importación ($1500) se perdería, así que no me queda otra más que hacer la garantía válida.Otro problema que encontré es que la tarjeta de WiFi modelo MT7921 es muy nueva y no está soportada todavía en Linux. En el sitio del fabricante dice que desde el kernel 5.12 la soporta, pero yo probé hasta el 5.13 y nada.Fuera de esos detalles de hardware, el producto está muy bien y me parece buena relación calidad-precio.",0
(Great laptop): Great laptop but I would suggest upgrading wireless card.,0
"(tons of issues): I bought this laptop about six months ago and it constantly has issues. Anytime I lift it up and set it down on another surface, the laptop completely freezes. You can't use task manager to restart, so you have to do a hard power down to begin using the laptop again. I know it's priced cheap, but you can get more bang for your buck with another laptop.",0
(One Star): Already messing up. Ready to return. Maybe got s lemon,0
(Powerful): Nice small powerful gadget,0
"(It's definitely a buy): I loved the design. It's pretty, although a little dirty, since it's a magnet for fringerprints, but nothing a little cleaning can't solve.I got the version of 16GB ram and core i7 12th gen, and it's a beast. There's no program this laptop can't run. I've had it for a couple of weeks and I mainly use it for engineering (solidworks, matlab, autocad 3D, etc) and it runs everything smoothly.I've only had the chance to try it on fornite, but it can run it with everything in epic quality, so I expect it to run any other game without any problem.It's, in my opinion, a great laptop for university students (specially if you study engineering like me, or architecture), who want a great experience working on it and also playing video games.I haven't had any problem with fans or temperatures as others comments mention, but this is just my experience with this device.I had it for $1069 + $65 on taxes, and it was definitely worth it.I'm from Mexico btw, but I asked a friend of mine who was in USA that brought it to me and it's just perfect.",0
(Works great for work): Not HD so not the best video quality for watching shows & movies or gaming but works perfect for price,0
The battery life seems to last forever.,0
(Awesome M2 Chip in this thing!): I'm super happy with this Mac! What more can I really say.,0
The specs and potability are fantastic.,0
(battery charger is garbage): 2nd time in 6 months it stops working. And battery life is utter garbage. Laptop is great but battery power is absolute crap.,0
"(small, portable, and light): it seems slow in the beginning, but all you need to do is change the settings and make it work faster. needs a lot of updates so be sure to do all of them. comes with windows 10 s, which is kinda bad because you can’t really download anything, especially chrome. change it to windows 10 and your all set.",0
(Windows 10): You should put windows on the laptop,0
"It's light, has very good specs, and the 144hz screen is great.",0
"(Terrible product): I bought this as “Used, Like New”. The screen started flickering immediately. This item will be going back. I cannot speak to new versions of this laptop but do NOT waste your money or time on the used product.",0
"(A BUST!): Bought this laptop back in November 2018, and I have already had send it back to the manufacture. I was editing photos when all of a sudden it stopped and displayed the ""Blue Screen of Death"". It would not enter recovery nor would it boot up from a thumb drive. ( Yes I made sure security was off in BIOS). Luckily I was able to recover everything from my hard drive via an adapter, before I flashed the recovery OS back on the Hard Drive; Still nothing.Even when this was working, my presets in Light Room would hesitate to load and make changes at times. Worst laptop I’ve owned, and definitely not a good first experience with SSD. Hopefully ASUS can repair it so I can sell it.",0
(Not enough space): It ran out of hardrive space after I downloaded 1 app,0
The coolest thing is how lightweight it is,0
The touchscreen is bright and beautiful with a full HD (1920 x 1080) LED backlit widescreen.,0
"(Big screen for a good price.): Purchased as a work from home and internet browser. Love the large screen and the size and weight of the Chromebook. A good, laptop for the price.",0
(didn't last even 2 years -): This laptop was used in one place - never transported and knocked about. The LED light in the screen stopped working after less than 2 years. If you plug the computer into another monitor you can see that it is working but really not impressed with the lifecycle of this model. I wish I noticed they were going from a 2 to 1 year warranty before I made my purchase!,0
"(Not user friendly): This laptop has S-Mode, essentially it will only download Microsoft apps.",0
"(Bad Buying Experience with Dell; First Impression: The Back-Lit Keyboard Is Worse Than Worthless): I purchased this New XPS 13 9380 directly from Dell. My purchase experience with Dell was dreadful. More about that later. For now, just know that if you do decide to buy any Dell PC, I strongly recommend that you do NOT purchase direct from Dell. Instead, purchase from Amazon or some other retailerOut of the box, the first very aggravating thing I noticed on initial boot up was that the back-lighting on the white keyboard makes it impossible to tell which key is which. I guess if I were sitting in a cave or a closet, the back-lighting might help, but in anything like ordinary lighting conditions, the back-lighting makes it very much harder to tell which key is which. This back-lighting """"""""feature"""""""" (quadruple scare quotes intended) seems to be an example of someone at Dell falling so totally in love with a concept that they forget to consider whether the concept actually does what it is supposed to do. So I spent 30 minutes Googling how to ""fix"" this lovely feature by turning off the backlighting. (You have to change the BIOS settings!) And then I spent another good while worrying about whether attempting the fix (by going into BIOS) might ruin my brand new multi thousand dollar machine. But then I figured, the heck with it: if I'm going to do break this baby, now is the time, because my best shot at getting my money back is now when it is fresh out of the box. So I went into BIOS and turned off the ding-dang back-lighting so now I can actually see the keys. Really, guys, if you are going to make a """"""""feature"""""""" that works best when it's turned off, maybe you oughta at least make it so the poor customer doesn't have to modify BIOS to shut the dang thing off.Other first impressions: The initial boot up sequence was clunky and didn't work quite right. When I was asked if I wanted to set up MS Office, and clicked ""yes,"" I didn't realize it would be setting up the free-for-30-day subscription version of Office (Office 365) instead of the permanent-license version that I paid for when I bought this machine from Dell. Then later, I was navigated involuntarily to a download of the what I now realize was the permanent license version of Office that I had already paid for. So I DL'd that and installed it. Well, it turns out that having both the subscription version and the permanent version of Office on this machine was not a good thing, because they didn't seem to play nice together. Argggg! Although the technology itself is getting better, the implementation and coordination of the technology is getting worse.Also, I have to mention that my purchase experience with Dell was an utter complete and total fiasco. It was like a circus, when the elephants and lions escape into the crowd and start eating people and trampling people. Okay, it wasn't quite that bad, but it was a major, multi-part fiasco. Just one small example of the fiasco: I had to cancel my initial order with Dell and re-order because the person who took my initial order left the ""A"" off of my house number. The Dell rep told me cancelling and re-ordering was the only way to fix the error, but assured me it would take ""only a few minutes."" One and one-half hours later, we were still on the phone trying to get things corrected with Dell Financial Services (which also used the wrong address) to make sure that I didn't get charged for two orders instead of just one. I would never have financed the machine (I have plenty of money, thank you) except the guy who took my first order (the guy who messed up the address in the first place) said it would help him out if I did so. Apparently, the Dell sales people get some kind of benefit if they can get customers to sign up for financing. The financing was free for one year, so I figured, ""what the heck, I'll take the financing if it helps out one of my fellow human beings."" Big mistake! Because it took hours to fix the address error with Dell Financial Services.I forgot to mention that Dell has a a price match guarantee, according to which, if you are buying directly from Dell, Dell will match the price offered by any other qualifying retailer, including Amazon. The thing is, when I found a cheaper price on Amazon, Dell did not want to match the price. First the Dell sales rep said they couldn't find the matching item on Amazon. So I emailed Dell the link to the match item. Then they said the link did not connect to the matching item, so I emailed them a screen shot that showed that it did match. Then Dell said the link was for an item that did not qualify. I asked why, and the Dell rep said a supervisor would have to explain it to me. So I waited on hold for a Dell supervisor. The supervisor went through three or four bogus reasons why the item on Amazon supposedly was not a qualifying offer, but I shot those down, one by one, using Dell's own term and conditions for the price match. Finally, the supervisor agreed that the offer I showed him did qualify for the price match, and he accepted the order. But then, he entered my address wrong on the order. So when I got the confirmation email, they said I had to cancel and re-order, at which point I said, I am not doing that again. If I try to re-order, your sales people will make me jump again to receive your price-match guarantee. I told them if they sent the product to the wrong address and it was lost, that would be on Dell, because I had a recording of our phone conversation wherein I specifically emphasized the ""A"" that is appended on my house number. So finally, they bumped me up the Dell hierarchy a couple of levels, and the person I connected with agreed to fix the issue, which she said would take only few minutes. But, as previously mentioned, it took hours to fix the simple mistake of an incorrect address.So if you must buy a Dell product (which are overpriced unless you buy them with a steep discount), do not purchase directly from Dell.The whole ordering experience put me in a bad frame of mind, but I was ready to be happy when my machine arrived. But then, the first time I boot up, I noticed that the back-lit keyboard makes it impossible to see the lettering on the keys . . . Sheeesh!",0
"the frame of the laptop is almost too flexible, it seems like they made the chassis too thin",0
"(Great Computer): This is our third Acer Aspire and I can't say enough good things about it! We purchased this particular laptop for my wife because she decided to go back to work and her Chromebook wasn't enough for what she required. She took to her new laptop immediately and loves it. Easy setup and smooth transition from Chromebook to Laptop/Windows 11. I highly recommend this laptop for those needing a basic, no frills, powerful laptop for everyday use.",0

The screen looks great,0
I use for work and play,0
(.): :),0
"(Super fast and easy to use.): Why I took so long to get a chromebook is beyond me. The best purchase I ever made. It takes minutes to set up. Runs so fast, and is easy to use. I love the fact that there are not a bunch of programs already on the computer. I use my computer for personal home use: paying bills, watching movies, surfing the web, checking email. The battery life is INCREDIBLE! if you want an every day computer that is easy to use and boots up quickly, this is for you.",0
(Excellent): I love the graphics in the computer. I use it for gaming and the graphics have been clear and vibrant.,0
"(Not Many 5-Star Reviews In My Profile): To others considering this machine, while the Chromebook is, in a technical sense, a computer, it is not to be confused with a standard Windows or Macintosh desktop or laptop. The Chromebook does not use either the Windows or Mac operating system, but a Google browser-based OS (operating system). For eMail and basic Microsoft work, the machine is (except for the somewhat disorienting keyboard layout and missing function buttons) ideal.If you want to do desktop publishing (Adobe), huge spreadsheets, or advanced computer-based games, buy a ""real"" computer--and spend another $1,000 and spend months fighting with Windows 10 (which is pretty much being forced upon everyone due to the collusion between M'Soft and the manufacturers). BTW, if you have previously used Windows NT or 7, DO NOT make the mistake of buying a Windows 10 machine. Like thousands of others, you'll wind up at your local computer repair place begging them to install Windows 7--and gladly paying for the privilege.",0
(Great Laptop): Amazing laptop love everything about! Amazing quality and durable had over 4 months and using in a deployed environment amazing at its sturdiness! Crystal clear graphics. Keyboard is very good. Love the personalization that you can do as well. Would buy again.,0

(The Cord Frayed in 3 months): The laptop is fine but has an unusual cord connection and the cord frayed in only three months.,0
"(Acer Chromebook review): I have always been a PC fan and have never previously owned a Chromebook. I have been looking for an MS alternative for a while as the issues and maintenance of a MS PC have grown old. I wanted an easy to use and maintain system that was inexpensive but still fast to boot up and use. The Chromebook fit all of those requirements nicely. The setup of this system was very easy and the interface isn't that different from an Android phone. It didn't take long at all to figure out where everything was located and so far the system has worked flawlessly. The battery life is great and the 15.6"" screen is the same size as the older laptop that it replaced. I was able to show my non-PC savvy wife how to use this system without any problems. The hardware is more than capable of running the Chrome OS and there are plenty of apps available to do just about anything that you could want to do. The only shortfall would be if you require a specific software that will only run on a MS PC then this system would not work for you. For the vast majority of users this system will work fine. I have a relative who purchased an expensive MacBook and this Chromebook is very comparable to that system at less than 1/3 of the cost. I would definitely recommend this Chromebook.",0
"(So far, so good): Very.nice",0

The backspace after the first day broke.. and the repairman couldn't get it fixed. The graphics card studdered or something within the hardware was studdering once when I was play ESO. The boot-time on this device is very good. You can upgrade the SSD and RAM in the future if needed. It's a shame that my backspace broke on the first day, and that graphics studder scared me.I will update my review once I get a replacement.",0
(BEST at a GREAT price!!): This laptop was purchased for me to allow for a more portable lifestyle.

The PERFECT starter laptop for ANYONE!! NICE WORK ASUS!,0
Lid started to come apart less than one month after I got it,0
"(Super fast, low battery life, great for playing any game): Bought this late last year for myself. Overall I'm happy with it. I went into it knowing it had a short battery life, was a little heavy, and possibly had a loud fan. The battery life is definitely really short, around 2 hours, so be prepared to carry around the charger with you. The fan makes noises, like any fan, it's fine. The backlit keyboard is nice and it's a really fast computer. Love the extra storage for my games. The sound quality good for the most part, I was expecting it to be a little bit better but no big deal. Overall very happy for my purchase. Make sure you know what things you're willing to sacrifice for a gaming laptop, because only the most expensive ones have everything you want.",0

(Battery only lasts 2 hours): The computer itself isn’t so bad however from Day one the battery only lasts roughly 2 hours. We got it for my son for school. It’s only used for school stuff. No gaming or anything like that so the fact the battery only lasts 2 hours is very frustrating.,0
"(Mouse quit less than a month in): My son uses a chrome book for school. He had his last one for 3 years with no issues but thought going into high school we would upgrade. Well we have had nothing but issues with it. It won't stay connected to the internet, it runs super slow and now the mouse won't work at all. Not happy with our purchase.",0
"(Delivered super fast.): Wow! came fast and brand new, thank you",0
"(Helpful addition to tracking news, etc.): Learning the Chrome system has taken some time, but it is enjoyable.",0
(Excelente pc): Muy buena maquina.,0
the keyboard is great and from an old school typist like me,0
"(Not ideal as a work computer due to performance & battery life): Using this computer as a work computer during the pandemic, I found that it would get sluggish after a while with a number of tabs open (15 or so, running apps like slack, office365, webex, VDI, gmail, google drive), to the point where I would have to reboot at least daily. A couple of times the computer froze, probably from intense usage. Battery life is so-so; when using computer for work, it lasts about two thirds of a workday before it needs to be charged up again. Luckily it charges pretty quickly. The finish is pretty nice it, though some of the rubberized bumpers easily fell off and got lost. It has two USB-C ports for charging, but I've noticed that they've started to charge inconsistently where sometimes I would have to position the computer in a certain way (upside down?) in order for the charge to hold - this will warrant sending the laptop in for servicing. Lastly, the front facing camera doesn't have the best quality, particularly in low-light it is pretty washed out.This computer is probably best for casual personal use rather than intense multi-tasking. At just under $500, it's a question if there isn't a cheaper chromebook out there that would be fine for casual level usage.",0
"(Buena compra.): Desde que la recibí y hasta ahora me ha funcionado perfectamente. Muy buen desempeño. Enciende en solo 4 segundos y tiene muy buen sonido. Le tengo habilitado el modo para extender el tiempo de vida de la bateria con el que carga solo hasta 79% y con ello puedo trabajar hasta 2 horas con office utilizando un brillo de pantalla de 40%. No he probado hasta ahora cuanto tiempo me puede durar una carga del 100% pero le estimo aproximadamente de 2.5 a 3 horas con un plan equilibrado. Me ha funcionado muy bien con programas de cálculo y diseño CAD. Es la primera vez que compro la marca ASUS, por lo que espero no me decepcione.Como punto malo es el espacio limitado de almacenamiento por lo que es necesario instalar una segunda unidad de disco duro para poder disponer de ello. Lo bueno es que si cuenta con el puerto de conexión SATA para unidades de disco duro convencionales o de estado sólido según se prefiera. Solo que la unidad deberá ser slim (de los modelos más delgados) puesto que el espacio es reducido.",0
"(A cheap laptop that works well with Geforce Now): This laptop is a ""you get what you pay for"" kind of deal and running programs locally on the Chromebook is slow but running programs in the cloud is a whole different case. I tried gaming on this laptop with the help of Geforce Now, a cloud gaming platform, and it was awesome. If you have internet download speeds of at least 20MB or higher, you can run games like Fortnite or Apex Legends like you would on your Desktop. If your looking for a cheap laptop to mess around with or do anything in the cloud, I recommend this.",0
"(Very Nice Budget Laptop): Good budget laptop. For a price like this, you can do schoolwork and play casual games. But beware when playing games on this as it can get hot quickly.",0
"(Excellent computer for High School on-Line studies.): It’s not the fastest computer. Average for on-line gaming. If you are looking for a gaming laptop, this is not the one. Performance is very good for everything else. Pleased with purchase!",0
"(Gaming laptop): Made for gaming. I've had no problems running various games at high setting with no frame rate drop. As far as everything else, no complaints. Gets a bit warm after a while, like any laptop made for gaming would. Invest in an external fan.",0
I found the usage of this keyboard uncomfortable enough to return,0
"(Dropping Wifi - awful unreliable rubbish.): We've had the Chromebook only a short few weeks, and already we're having problems with it. The Wi-Fi keeps on cutting out, and refusing to reconnect without a restart. A Chromebook without WiFi is pretty pointless. Looking to return.",0
(One Star): the screen broke a month after i had it.,0
(Meets our needs): This computer does everything we need it to do.,0
"(Non Functional Device): This laptop will not connect to Microsoft, Windows, or Office.com using a Microsoft business email address, making it worthless for business use. This limitation was not disclosed. We purchase PC’s and laptops so we have an inventory for new employees, thus putting us outside the return window. Amazon Business should not sell non-business products. This will just go in the trash because Amazon does not offer another solution. Do not purchase for business use.",0
"(Excellent!!!): Great value, just what I was expecting!!!",0
(Don't buy one): Worst keyboard I have ever used. Returned it to HP for warranty repair twice and the replacement parts failed just like the original ones did.,0
"(Tiny.): I knew a 14"" laptop was going to be small, but dang. Wasn't prepared for how small the screen and the keyboard would be.",0
"(Disappointed): Can barely have multiple internet tabs open without the computer taking forever to load anything. Very low volume levels with speakers that point straight down on the bottom of the computer for some reason. Had an older chrome book that worked great for what I use it for which is mainly just browsing the internet, watching YouTube, etc. I’m not sure how one that is 3 years newer than what I had and similar price has so much worse performance.",0
"(No touch screen on mine, perfect for not so techie me): Totally love it. It is 10 times faster than the one that died (different brand). I was nothing to get it started up. The battery lasts 12 hours! I am not lying! I saw it had good reviews and took a chance. I know next to nothing about computers and I know I got so lucky with this one.Thanks Acer!",0
"(Fantastic for an inexpensive chromebook!!! Thumbs up): Just general internet surfing... Not the, biggest screen but hook it up to my 49"" Amazon purchased t.v. Works fantastic!!!!",0
"(Great laptop that has been reliable for the past 2 months!): I've had this laptop for about 2 months now and I'm happy with it. Thus far it has had great battery life (I can go a few hours without a charge), all ports work fine, it is incredibly lightweight (I barely notice it in my backpack) and I haven't had any issues yet. The computer is quiet and runs quickly when I have numerous programs open. The fingerprint reader is nice, but it doesn't work all the time (I'd say about 70-80%). The screen's colors aren't the brightest and occasionally images as crisp as they should be. You should also be careful resting your wrists on it while typing because there is keyboard flex.",0
I only have one negative thing to say so far and that is that it is a fingerprint magnet.,0
"(Great keyboard): Bought for my grandson, he loves it! He’s got it up and running in no time. Plug and play!",0
"(her name is hela and she is the destroyer of worlds): Great laptop love everything about it from the looks to the way it games, downloads, and overall laptopness. I had to buy an extra hard drive for more storage",0
(It was a great buy!!): Nothing yet!!,0
(No es lo que dice el artículo): La lapto no tiene tarjeta de red inalámbrica no es core i7 es core i5 vino en una caja que no es de ella y no es nueva y solo tiene 256gb no 512gb,0
"(Great laptop, poor battery life): Its really a great laptop. Overall good for playing. The only thing that would need improvement would be the battery life.",0
(Excelente): Es una buena computadora en mi caso es para programación y la verdad va muy bien en todos los aspectos su única limitación que yo veo es la memoria pero fuera de eso todo bien,0
"(Great Machine): Very light, with good battery life. Screen is excellent.",0
"(Great computer great price for Architecture School): I use this computer for Architecture school, and does everything i need, its fast and reliable.",0
"(poor thermal design): good laptop when it comes to specs, design and software. Problem is that the fans run all the time and there are no controls to prevent this. Dell has removed the windows power plan control settings that influence CPU load and fan control in their own app, which can be configured to ""quite mode"" but fans are still running all the time.",0
"(Great Buy! I love it!): I love my product, this the 5 stars, but I will just need to critique the company real quick. When I ordered this model, apparently they didn’t have it in stock anymore so they sent me the newest version with no additional cost. Which was great!... But here’s the critique- it was a different color and at first I freaked out because I wasn’t sure if I’d like the Poseidon blue color versus the dark ash color I had preferred and ordered. The company sent Poseidon blue without checking with me first. They sent me an email saying they didn’t have dark ash color anymore and that they could send me the newer (late 2020) Poseidon blue model instead, but I’d have to reply soon. They didn’t wait for my approval and shipped the Poseidon blue color within an hour, even though their initial email said I had up to 3 hours to reply. I’m not angry but something like this could just really be inconvenient.About the laptop:- it’s heavier than I expected and the fan can be a little loud (not THAT loud) here and there. I’m not used to that because my MAC is usually quiet and it very lightweight.-with that said it’s GORGEOUS, sleek looking and works great! So glad I bought it. I will say if you have big hands, this keyboard and touchpad setup may not be for you because the trackpad is relatively small and it’ll feel like your palms can’t rest on the laptop itself. I don’t know if This makes sense but definitely watch the reviews about it! They’re right.",0
(nice small laptop): a little slow but adequate for home. could have included more apps for productivity,0
(Laptop): Did not get it..but yet it said delivered,0
(Great purchase!!): The battery life is decent. I also don’t have much on it yet since it’s still new but i must say it has been holding a great charge. It also was more on the less expensive side to be brand new 2022! I’m loving it so far !,0
The audio is the best I've encountered,0
"(Very solid components for the price I paid): I bought this laptop at $1399, and at that price this laptop is an excellent deal.Games:I mostly use this laptop to play League of Legends, which it can run on high settings at about 170fps.Work:I also use this as my work computer, which requires me to do image analysis and work with somewhat large datasets. I can have multiple computationally intense tasks running at once without too much issue, although that is with the understanding that doing this on a laptop is going to have intrinsic limits.Build quality:Everything feels sturdy and well made. That being said, one of the most common issues with laptops is their longevity, and I can't comment on that at this time. The trackpad works very well and feels good to use.Overall:I'm quite happy with my purchase so far. Because I tend to use my laptops for both work and personal use, they get a lot of hours put on them and all of the hours I've spent on this one so far have been good.",0
(Sleek and lightweight): Very lightweight and sleek looking. Fast processing speed and easy to use. Only downside is all the software updates and restarts... it’s annoying.,0
(HDD is only 475 GB and not 512!): The description says that the laptop is 512 GB. Mine has only 475 GB.I payed lot of money for this machine and it’s quite disappointing that you don't get what they advertise.,0
"(Excellent!): complied with all specifications published in the description, very good buy I recommend it",0
"(Dieseño): Excelente equipo, para juegos no tan optima sin embargo se los puede correr, para trabajo o estudiante es excelente",0
(Disappointed to say the least): Terrible. No battery life - keeps disconnecting from WiFi. It’s the only device in our house that will not function- so upset we wasted money. This was suppose to go to college with my son :(,0
(You need to do the research & look at the reviews before purchasing.): It crashes often due to it being very slow. Not what I expected With this lab top.,0
"(Fan Noise): Its Strong and i love its touch, however the fan is loud and it hinders the speaker quality therefore you need headsets",0
(Impressive): A quality laptop,0
"The screen is comfortable for working on Excel files, with plots.",0
"(Great Computer!): Durable, user friendly, compatitble with many programs.",0
"(works as long as no one else is using wifi...): laptop was exactly as expected, brand new with no blemishes.item came the exact day amazon said it would with the regular usps mail. do your research on windows 10S. the ""S"" mode is a feature meant for students in a school or for children or people that constantly click on links that provide malware and viruses to your computer. a quick trip to the windows app store on your laptop, you can take this function off but you can not get it backk.2gigs or ram kinda sucks but for a laptop that cost 153$ i really cant complain.",0
"(ZERO ZERO STARS""""""""''''THE WORSE COMPUTER EVER DONT BOTHER""""""""""""""""): WORSE COMPUTER EVER PURCHASED, SUPER SLOW I HAVENT UPLOAD OR DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FOR THAT REASON. COMPUTER TAKES FOR EVER TO GET TO THE INTERNET.I DIDNT HAVE A CHANCE TO PLAY WITH THIS UNTIL LAST WEEK AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED: BATTERY DOESNT LAST EVERY TIME I TURNED IT ON I HAVE TO CHARGE IT TO FULL AND NEXT DAY DO THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN .",0
"(I HATE this laptop... The WIFI keeps shutting off and it deletes itself completely from the system): The laptop has to be shut off and restarted. NO USING the RESTART function either. I have to shut it down, wait a bit, then start it for the WIFI to reappear. All work is lost! And, you can not add anything to the task bar! All the sites I frequently use, can not be dragged & added. WTH? I have had this laptop less then 24 hours and I absolutely HATE IT!",0
"(DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY): Totally unreliable. Stopped working in 3 weeks. Will not turn on. I researched fixes on YouTube and tried everything that was suggested without success. I am on an extended overseas trip for several months and had to purchase a new laptop in order to stay connected with work and family, a hassle I did not need. Not sure if I can even return this item for a full refund when I return to the US.",0
(Sucks): Sucks,0
"(Buy on sale, get a mouse, and have fun.): Its good",0
it's beautiful and it plays games well the keyboard has a kind of a shallow input but that can be getting used to,0
"(Best Price to Performance + Portability and Battery Life + Design Quality Engineering There Is to the Best of My Knowledge): People whine about thermal throttling and coil whine, no pun intended! ;) But seriously, I bought this used like-new condition from Amazon warehouse which was most likely a return and CDI showed only a couple hours on the SSD. I love this laptop and have had it for about a month now. I hardly ever write product reviews, but it seems like there are a lot of complaints about this laptop and it doesn't get the credit it deserves. For these specs while maintaining slim and light profile good luck finding a better deal. I did pay $1400 plus tax which is slightly lower than the current price but I challenge others to comment on laptops with similar specs and design quality to compare this to. The Dell XPS 15 is in the archetype but lacks the specs unless you want to pay $2000. And sure, it has a 4k display, but at the cost of earlier GPU model, on a 15"" with the pixel density, 4k is just marketing unless you need 4k for visual design projects there is not much point, you have to render 4k and then increase zoom anyway. There are some drawbacks though and 1. I am not super impressed with the keyboard. It performs fine and no problems with ghosting, but when I'm really hammering away at the keys like I'm used to doing on my desktop pc, there is a slight rattle, but that's just me being too rough on the keyboard due to my fast and high-actuation force typing habits. The next issue is that I really liked the silver design of the UX430UN, and I wish they would have incorporated that design into this build rather than the black spun metal which is very attractive and has class, but also attracts fingerprints. So have an anti-static microfiber cloth and screen/keyboard cleaner handy (which you should when you own a touchscreen laptop anyway), but it's not as bad as I might make it sound. It's not a fingerprint magnet, it's just that the silver spun metal design didn't show any fingerprints, greasy or clean barely. Lastly, sure, there is some thermal throttling if you are playing graphic intensive games, but I can play Destiny 2 on Medium settings with a few things tweaked at 60FPS no problem. It will start to slow down as it heats up a little bit, but a Havik cooling pad eliminates that problem. Keep in mind this is not a gaming-designed laptop although it plays most games very well. The thermal engineering was done well and the keyboard never gets hot, only the back and only when you're running the GPU at full load for an extended period. Any other case it runs cool, setting it on your lap and browsing, editing office files, watching videos, it will stay nice and cool for around 10-11 hours of basic mixed use.",0
(do not buy): worked for 48 hours then would no longer power on. do not buy.,0
"(Fantastic Gaming Laptop): The laptop came well packaged and took 10 minutes to set up and update. It's a massive upgrade over my 8 year old HP gaming laptop. Having a solid state drive, 32 GB of RAM, i7 processor, and the RTX 2060 video card makes this laptop an absolute beast. Sager does a great job of only including the necessary software you need to run Windows and doesn't include bloatware and garbage that just slows down a computer. Being able to adjust the computer performance, fan speed, and keyboard backlight color are nice additions. My only negative comment is that when gaming the fans can get fairly loud. Its not to the point that my wife has to kick me out of the living room so she can watch TV, but you do need to wear headphones if you want to be able to hear your game without the volume on 100. That's the thing with gaming laptops: with all that power they produce a lot of heat and you can either get it out of the machine with powerful fans or feel like you've got a toaster oven in your lap. It's definitely worth investing in a cooling pad to help keep airflow to the bottom of the laptop.",0
"(There are better options available, avoid this laptop): I have had this laptop for almost a year and overall I am very disappointed. There are many things that I have tried to get used to but has made enjoying this laptop difficult if not impossible. The mouse trackpad is awful. Speakers are equally as poor. Other reviews have bragged about the battery life but I have found mine to be terrible; I cant rely on it without a charger. Also, it has had a lot of miscellaneous bugs (probably can blame microsoft here, but non-the-less it has been terribly frustrating).I really regret this purchase and would stronger recommend avoiding this laptop. The Lenovo Thinkpad that I had previous to this was much better. I do not plan on ever purchasing an ASUS again.",0
(2 defective items): First one had severe screen distortion. Replacement has just a black screen. Would not but this product again. Spent $50 to FedEx the 2nd laptop to the person that needed it immediately and 2nd one didn't work either. Going to buy a Mac book,0
"(Great, but 8GB of ram not enough at times, trackpad has issues): Took my chance and bought one used off Amazon warehouse deals. It's brand new except the warranty has only a few months left. Can't complain at all! This computer is awesome as I upgraded from 2013 Macbook Pro Retina. It's way faster. But 8GB of ram will be slow at times, and the laptop gets hot during summer months. Also the trackpad has a tendency of dragging instead of clicking when you're clicking around really fast. Like when you're trying to get that hot concert ticket, and you click really fast on Ticketmaster, it drags the text or link instead of clicking on it like it should which causes a second of two of delay. I hope they get this fixed but it's unlikely they will ever notice this. Most people don't use trackpad to click as fast as me.",0
"(Great all around computer for the price.): I am not a tech guy but this is a much better computer than my old one.I generally use my computers for email, surfing the web, zoom meetings and school.This Acer computer has performed beyond my expectations.The wifi connection is quick, applications always open fast.I really like the lit keyboard for working in darker areas.The finger scanner is great for security, works perfectly.The body is made of metal not plastic like my old computer, the hinges aresolid.The screen is fairly good looking, colors are bright and no problems with dead pixels.I am not a fan of the windows operating software as I have used Apple in the past and really like it a-lot.As usual with windows this computer comes with bloat items that I have no interest in using.The speakers are not great if you are wanting flawless sound from music or movies but that is to beexpected from a pc is this price range.This swift 3 is very light and easy to carry around the house or take on the go.",0
(Thanks): Thanks for allowing people like myself to afford such a nice product,0
"(Good laptop. I dig it.): I've had this laptop for 5 months now. Great price (Bought it when it was $400). Battery will last all day. After about 6/7 hours-ish, I have 40ish% (""-ish"" cuz I haven't cared to take notes). Boots up quickly thanks to that good, good SSD. IMO the only con is the size of the SSD, but that's easily managed. I have a few hard drives from other computers that I turned into external drives. I mostly use it for doing web development and podcast editing.",0
(Would reccomend): Good product and quality. Satisfied overall with chromebook and fast delivery!,0
(Perfect): Great. Light weight. Easy to use. Perfect chrome book.,0
Clean installation with a new m.2 SSD (512GB) was pretty fast,0

"(Horrible Battery Life & HDMI port died after 72 days :(): UPDATE 4.3.2019: The other bummer is battery life. It's supposed to get 8 hours. I'd be happy with 5 or 6.

(Just frustrated no way to make a recovery disk and support website is terrible): I am so frustrated. I just bought this system. I clicked on the acer folder that came with the system and there is no recovery disk section like my first acer. I went to their website and found an article that says my system includes acer recovery management software and it is NOwhere on my computer. This is very upsetting. I loved my first acer as everything was so easy and I promptly made recovery disks for that acer but I don't know why this new computer does not have any folder called Acer Recovery Management on it.ON top of that I have spent over an hour trying to figure out how to find the acer recovery management software that I need and the website is horrible: every time I click on support it says error..I don't know if I just need to return this stupid computer. I loved my first acer but this headache is not worth it. I can't even focus on whether the computer is good or not because I can't figure out how to make recovery disks. INFURIATING12/26/2002Update: in order to be fair about this machine I am going to wait until the holiday is over and see if I can actually get someone in tech support and find out about the missing software and see how the machine itself functions for the purpose for which I bought it,0

"(Perfect for our teen): Want a laptop that has full connectivity, speed, and works very well for schoolwork? Choose this one. As more teachers move to document sharing it makes sense to have something like this for your teen to use. The overall durability is a bit suspect but with the price tag, it is essentially a 1-2 year investment for school. Chromebooks are extremely light, easy to type on and come with complete integration into Google cloud services like drive, docs and spreadsheets. You will not be gaming hard on this laptop or installing anything locally if you can help it because it's best served as a cloud only device. If your looking for windows, gaming (instead of app games like your phone) and local storage I would look elsewhere.Make sure to get the versions with at least 4gb of ram, it does make a difference for multi-tasking.",0
The laptop came in a nice sleek box and a nice fabric sleeve.,0

(p/p): - 60w battery.- no mouse in box.- backlight blending (right bottom)+ no dead pixelsp/p,0
"(Excellent price! Play store apps now compatible, lags at times.): Compact design, good battery life. good screen size, good keyboard and mediocre speakers. For the price you can't go wrong. For those who don't know a Chromebook uses the chrome browser instead of dedicated apps. However that just changed with the newest update. You can now download and install apps from the playstore! This is a game changer for Chromebooks, which were previously held back by only using the chrome browsers (a few app exceptions). That being said, Chromebooks are still predominately web browsing laptops, as some apps from the playstore may not work correctly or be buggy. If you are unsure if a Chrombook is right for you, do this test for yourself. Avoid any apps on your pc / laptop, open the chrome browser and run everything through chrome for about a week. If you find you can complete 90% or more of tasks then pull the trigger and get one! You won't regret it. If however you rely on incompatible apps, or just find sticking to chrome isn't for you then you may want to avoid a Chromebook.Cont. Samsung is an overall great brand and you will enjoy this product. Be aware, these usually aren't very powerful so you may run into bouts of lag, crashes, and in compatibility. Videos tend to load slowly, but once buffered offer a seamless experience. My model has 4 gigs of ram. I think once these start shipping with a tad bit more ram it will be in that perfect sweet spot of saving money without too much sacrifice.",0
I was searching for a laptop that would meet my needs for gaming and have the battery life to take on the go to do school work,0
"(Over all great gaming laptop): It’s a great gaming laptop, it can and will get loud but ear buds or headphones would cover the noise up easily, I suggest upgrading storage and ram, battery life is less desirable when playing games",0
"(Not everything will run with chrome): Works great. If it will run on your android phone it will run on this computer. I'm sure it does more for the well versed, which isn't me, but it does what I need it to.",0
"(Good value for money Chromebook): A very good return for your money, fast and intuitive.",0
"(Best purchase ever.): Best purchase ever. I love the larger screen compared to my last chromebook that had a 11.6"" screen. It's lightweight and sturdy.",0
(Great computer): Great computer,0
(I like it): Great for what I use it for. Basic stuff - Google docs and watching videos and social media. Had an Asus Chromebook. The keys were smoother and more responsive on the Asus..,0

(Good for every day use): This is not a touchscreen. At least not that I’ve seen. I bought this for my son to do school work on and it proves good for that. It’s really not a gaming computer that I can see. Nice product for minimal use.,0
"(MUST HAVE FOR ANY STUDENT.): I have had the M1 MacBook Air 13-inch now since December 2020. It has served me so well and has been one of the most reliable laptops I've ever owned. I am originally a PC guy and now work back and forth between Windows OS and Mac OS.When it comes to rendering videos and clips, this does a way better job at 4K resolution compared to my former Alienware 17 inch laptop AND my workplace's gaming desktop!I am pretty happy with the battery life so far. I have been getting 10+ hours of hard real-world usage. I bring a nice USB-C portable battery with me to charge it when I am doing work on the weekends out of town or while on the plane. This thing has not failed me once.8GB of RAM is more than enough for the majority of consumers and is enough for me even though I edit photos and videos all the time. I have not seen any ""throttling"" from the M1 MacBook Air since ownership. I can even open up 30+ tabs on Chrome without issue.256GB storage is enough as long as you have an external storage. I highly recommend investing in getting an SSD or NVMe external storage so transfer speeds are optimal. Otherwise, as long as you are keeping the core hard drive tidy, you won't run into any storage issues.Virtual classes are nice. The webcam quality is crystal clear, and it is noticeably better than most of my peers.My only complaint is that the design is a bit ""outdated"" despite how premium and beautiful it is.Just FYI. I just bought two of these; one for myself and one for my friend who just had a massive upgrade from her ""prehistoric"" 2010 iMac. She was absolutely mindblown by how much faster and better it is compared to the older iMac.Overall, this is a very nice all-around computer laptop for ANY student from K all the way up to the graduate level. Go get this beast of a machine now for $850.",0

(My chromebook was defective because four keys were inoperable when it was received.): Product advertised as new condition but the keyboard had four defective. I paid $44.00 to replace.,0
"(GREAT FOR GRANNY!): At 72 , my old laptop broke, and this one filled the gap perfectly! It's lightweight, backlit, and works well for online shopping, bill paying, and learning! The only glitch for me was how low volume the speakers were, but the Audio Wizard fixed that - wish I could say exactly how it worked, but for me it was just hit or miss until I got the sound level where I wanted it! All in all, a great, inexpensive computer for seniors like me!",0
(Perfect!): Great size and perfect for what I need to do.,0
"(Perfect but...): The product arrived in perfect aesthetic condition but when i got to finally use it, the right speaker has a distorcion when punch it above 80 in the volume level, i mean its not a deal breaker but a mention of it in the description whould be nice, other than that its the best electronics purchase i've ever done, thanks a lot on the great deal Amazon",0

"(Microsux): My son bought this for himself with my account. He had no idea, granted that’s on him, that this really is an a computer. It’s a Microsoft platform that runs apps only. That means he cannot install Adobe acrobat DC or any other necessary .exe software that he needs for school. My favorite oxymoron, “Microsoft works“… Yeah… Right",0
(Great machine.): Great product.,0
"(Exceeded expectations): We're all PC gamers in this family! We have always used desktops, though, so I was skeptical about how this laptop would fare as my kiddo's first computer. It has done well! She is able to play the games she likes—Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Subnautica, and Heroes of the Storm for the most part—with no issues at all. I didn't know when I purchased it that it would also be her primary learning device when school came back around (thanks COVID!) but it has served us well on that front, too.",0
"(Fantastic computer for gaming and anything else you may need.): TLDR: Fantastic gaming laptop for the price with a GPU that is not quite future-proof, but plenty for right now. Full Analysis: I would recommend getting a computer stand or use a desk for this computer as the fans expel a ton of heat and can begin to really heat up your lap if you use it as a proper ""laptop."" That's good though because I have yet to notice anything overheating despite using it on soft surfaces (GPU reached 55 C once and it is rated for up to 95 C). It came with all the advertised components (unlike some other laptops I've ordered) and is fast on games. I run Apex Legends at a minimum of 90 FPS on ultra settings. All this being said, this is not future proof. More advanced games will probably not run well on this GPU in the future (The GPU is probably the most limiting factor). For present day however, absolutely fantastic and it should last you a couple years minimum if you want to use it for gaming. There are better prices elsewhere, but they are rated badly so it may be a scam and $1000 is a fair price for what you get. The backlight is useful at nighttime and the keyboard is easy to use and read. Make sure you have a look at the ports this has, as it does not have a micro SD card port which I wanted, I will need to get an adapter. I have not tried to upgrade the storage, RAM, or battery, but according to the questions section here you can upgrade all three to your choosing. GPU and CPU would be non-advisable to try and upgrade. The screen is great for gaming at 144 Hz refresh speed. Resolution is average for a laptop and will look good enough. With an HDMI cable I believe you can even use a better monitor if you wanted. The battery life is relatively lackluster with full battery and no intensive activities, alongside battery saver mode estimating 4 hours remaining. The Lenovo Vantage that comes with the laptop is superb at customizing performance, battery, and experience for a better rounded experience. It also provides support for overclocking, which is not necessary for gaming on this in my opinion. If you really want a more future resistant laptop, I would advise going for something with a better GPU which will cost quite a bit more. This laptop is great for the price. I cannot speak as to the longevity of the laptop as I am reviewing it after a day of testing. Hope this review helped in understanding the large upsides of this laptop, and the few downsides.",0
"(Just horrible): I bought this for my wife for Christmas and its a piece of junk. Feels very cheaply made but more importantly the layout is horrible, email is horrible, has insane amount of difficulty with passwords and access, you have trouble using other programs like Grammerly. It has been such a mess. Do not buy! I wish we could return it.",0
"(Great quality laptop for a fantastic price!): After doing some research I decided to go with this Asas Vivobook. I am so glad I purchased this laptop, needed something for my daughter’s online college courses. Easy to set-up and use, also able to use her wireless Bluetooth headphone. love the visual color display. Keyboard feels good and is very responsive. I have a fingerprint scanner for easy access to all password sites. The processor is very fast and there is no delay loading video or web pages. I highly recommend this laptop for similar use.",0
"(ASUS got it right.): Been using it for a month already, almost daily and it's just remarkable. Is a fast, good looking and light pc. Before buying did like 3 months research on most of the pc available on different brands, read so many reviews and view a lot of videos recommending new pc's. So, bottom line, I made the right buy.",0

(Never Buy it): I bought it last year，and I encountered a series problems during the using. Firstly，the wireless didn't work sometimes and it greatly impeded my life and working. Secondly，the picture quality is so terrible as to being worse than my Sony laptop bought 7 years ago. Thirdly，the touchpad often goes malfunction and I couldn't move the cursor. The last but not least，processing is not fluent and will be stuck sometimes. What a disgusting laptop！！！I seriously doubt that it was REFURNISHED.,0
"(Pretty good bang for the buck): With a Steeleries keyboard, i7 processor and 2070 video card, this is a lot of machine for just a shade under 1500 bucks. The cooling system is certainly better than the Dell G5 I returned to get this machine. Great for the kid's school as well as handles any game she wants to play, without flinching. A little bit better audio (speakers) and this thing gets 5*.",0
"(Got this as a gift for my stepfather): Absolutely perfect for him as he’s not into gaming or anything serious that requires serious hardware. For browsing and such this is great, actually much larger than I expected. Years ago I had one of the first chrome books which was very small, this is the size of a full laptop. Fast opening speed, hardly a difference from my $2400 Alienware r9 opening a google chrome window.",0

"(It's a basic Chromebook): We bought this for the most recent school Covid closures last January, and to have as a backup. Definitely nice for a Chromebook. If you Google reviews on this model, you'll see it's highly regarded. But don't expect any wow factor such as a high res screen, it's simply a dependable and reliable product for the price.",0
"(Solid computer with fast processing and refresh speed): It was purchased for work to process CAD and Lumion-3D, not gaming. But our design work puts heavy demands on video, memory and speed, similar to gaming. So far, it's performing perfectly and doing everything we need it to. It's not particularly light weight but what do you expect from a large screen laptop. Really happy with this purchase and price.",0

"(Great, especially for the price): UPDATED REVIEW: So I've owned this laptop for about a year now, and I'd like to add a few more details about my experience with it after so long, as most reviews are given after a few days or weeks and I thought this would be helpful. Specifically I want to talk about a couple of cons I've come across. The two biggest issues I've had with the machine so far have just been Windows 10 breaking down and not due to the Zenbook's actual hardware, so I won't go into detail about that. However, I've still had some more minor issues with the laptop itself.The first thing I noticed was that the bezel's ever-so-slight separation and overlap of the screen sometimes traps tufts of things, at the bottom near the Asus logo. This isn't something that's worsened over time, it's just part of the build like most laptops. But it's just separated enough that it sometimes catches pieces of hair or lint that are visible and hard to pull out. You can get your fingernail in or jam a credit card in between the screen and aluminum if you wanted (wouldn't recommend). The next thing is the track pad. It works just fine 95% of the time, but if you try to two-finger scroll too fast it'll just stop working, although the other functions are still intact. The pad starts working normally if you give it a ten-second break or so and do your scrolling at a medium to slow speed. And the location of the power button on the keyboard isn't ideal. I've accidentally hit it while aiming for the backspace button a few times. Not fun. And as some other reviewers have mentioned, when the fans start going on this laptop you can sometimes hear this little clicking, like the fan is rattling something. It's not present frequently enough for it to be a deal-breaker issue for me, though.I'm still pretty happy with my purchase overall, although as time has gone on I've regretted not getting something with a touchscreen. I intend to upgrade to another laptop in the coming months and selling this one. Would still recommend this laptop for its price range.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Let me start by saying that I love this laptop, especially for the price. Maybe I'm overly impressed considering my last one was, while sturdy, about as functional as a plastic toaster from the early 2000s, but I digress. I'm giving this Asus five stars within the context of its price range, and having owned it for five months, so settle yourselves in for a chunky review.This laptop is hella thin. It's about the size of one of those expensive, medium-sized sketchbooks with only twenty pages in it, and it weighs almost nothing. It's super portable, and quiet in my experience though other reviewers have said otherwise, and the battery life is pretty good. It claims twelve hours and while it's never lasted that long yet, I've gotten to ten thus far. The display is pretty nice too, with an impressively crisp resolution, bold colours, and it has a matte finish which makes it easier on the eyes and doesn't reflect what's behind you (which I find most laptops I've seen do).It has three different USB ports which have all served me fine, and a headphone jack. I don't usually use the speakers so I can't say whether they're better or worse than anything else on the market. The keys are easy to spend lots of time typing on without ever becoming uncomfortable or clunky. I'm really happy it has a fingerprint reader as well, which I first thought was gimmicky but I use it almost exclusively now. There is no CD player for those who still use CDs on their laptop, but I am not one of those people.The contender against this Zenbook was the Macbook Air. I chose this one over it because it had the newer core processor, bigger storage, and could be opened up at the bottom without a technician if any issues were to arise – all for less money. Not to diss Apple, but every Macbook I've seen has that ultra-glossy screen and matte body which both seem to get really filthy, and this laptop has so far been easy to keep clean. The spun-metal aluminum of the Zenbook's exterior is also a finish I happen to enjoy.I wish I could brag about how fast this laptop's internet connection is, but I can't because the internet signal by default is absolute crap where I live in ye rural Canada. It's otherwise pretty fast to respond, and has faster internet compared to what I had prior. It boots up in just a few seconds which I appreciate.I have experienced only one issue with the laptop where the fingerprint scanner stopped working after a Windows 10 update. The computer seemed to have forgotten it had a fingerprint reader altogether, and I was unable to find a solution to fix this. Thankfully, a week or two later another Windows update came by and the problem disappeared. The only other small nitpick I have would be when the laptop is charging – the little orange light on the side will turn green when the battery is full, but the desktop itself when turned on will often still say 99% or one minute to full charge remaining.All in all, this Asus blows my previous five-hundred bucker wonderbread laptop out of the water. I guess this one is technically still an “economy level” computer being only $1000, but I personally think it was well worth what I paid. Would recommend.",0
(the computer wasn't new!): I bought the computer less than a year ago. It was declared as 'new' and now when I wanted to use my warranty I discovered it is expired because it was opened more than 3 years ago so the computer couldn't be new.my earphones plugin does not work and I don't have a warranty.It's very annoying and frustrating.,0
(Loved it.): Works with Ubuntu 18.04. Battery can last more than 6 hours for web development. (running local server and vs code and browser). Haven't tried longer. Fast and No problems.,0
"(Amazing): This thing runs games perfectly for hours. I did not expect the screen to work as well as it does. The color is amazing, the pixel refresh rate works great for Skyrim. I am beyond happy with my purchase, it's been over 6 months.",0
"(In my un-professional opinion): I'm not a computer expert by any means, but this laptop is beautiful and the quality and processing speed are better than any other computer I've ever owned. The back lit keyboard is also a nice touch",0
"(Freezing & Lagging Right Out Of the Box! RETROGRADE MADNESS?): I hate leaving bad reviews for anyone, but I guess this was a bit of bad luck for me. Usually I strike gold with Amazon renewed products, but this was was a dud. I opened the box, in which the laptop was shipped just in the normal laptop box and not inside of another protective box. I selected English and waited for Windows to start. I got to the part where it asks for an email, I entered it and the laptop froze. I kept clicking and nothing. It finally unfreezes, allowing me to re-enter the email and click Next. NOPE! It froze again! When it finally unfroze another time, I was able to sign in.After the laptop finishes and windows completes, I click on McAfee and it takes forever to load. So I give up on that and try to open Edge to download Chrome and it also freezes and then goes into the “Not responding screen” and stays frozen until it closes. I ran the McAfee to make sure it wasn’t a virus on it or anything (I just opened the box right?). After it kept freezing I gave up and the boxed it and ran to the UPS Store to return this. It wouldn’t even allow me to remove or access the email account because it kept freezing.Maybe I will wait until this Retrograde is over around Jan 13th 2023 to try another laptop.",0
"(Unusable after a week): I was s happy with this laptop. It's extremely fast for video editing, streaming, gaming and it has a very stylish design.But after a week it started freezing and crashing. Showing the dreaded Blue Screen of death. I have done everything, update drivers, factory resets and nothing works.Apparently Lenovo has some issues with some Windows 10 Ver 1909 updates and the computer ended up being useless as it crashes every 10 minutes or so.Really disappointed as I had a Lenovo years ago and blindly trusted the brand.",0
"(Not a bad chromebook, a word of warning due to a design flaw regarding the charger.....): I was looking for something small and lightweight for use when in college. This fit the requirement nicely. Works fine without any issues at this point in time.I cannot give this 5 stars as I do not care about the design of the AC adaptor (specifically, the side of the charger that plugs into the chromebook itself). The jack going into the chromebook is very small and fragile and if not being properly taken care of will become damaged and unusable. To make matters worse, upon plugging the charger into the chromebook, it will easily pop out, causing the chromebook not to charge. The 'fix' or 'work around' for this is having to pull the wire and drape it across the chromebook as its charging as it creates that little extra pull to keep the chromebook charging.Not necessarily a huge concern as I can get it to charge without issue now, just a little disappointed in Samsung's bad design regarding the charger.",0
"(Best choice): Highy recomended, lightweight, portable, easy to carry",0
wouldn't get past the Blue Setup Screen,0
"(ASUS will continue to be my first choice for a laptop.): While I did look at several brands. ASUS was my first choice when I was browsing laptops for my daughter. I chose this one over a DELL and an ACER, and she loves it. And I have full confidence it will last for as long as she is in college. ASUS is a really solid company as far as laptops in my experience. I bought my first one in 2009. Then I upgraded to my current one in 2016. I have seen reviews about how horrible their customer service can be. However, I cannot speak to that since in all the years I have been an ASUS user. I have never needed to contact them. So when it comes time to upgrade my laptop again, ASUS will be my first choice.",0
(Good): Good for the price,0
(NOT A TOUCH SCREEN): NOT A TOUCHSCREEN,0
"(Returned): Whenever the laptop enters idle state or the lid is closed for a few minutes, the laptop becomes unresponsive. The screen is black, no keyboard or mouse input is accepted, and the fan makes a surging sound. In order to use the computer, the power button must be held down for 10 seconds to perform a hard reset. This means that every single time I go to use the laptop, it must be first powered down, powered up, rebooted in order to function. I tried restoring factory settings which removed all non-included applications. The issue remained after resetting to factory state.",0
"(great until its not): Never dropped it, never took it anywhere, it sat on my desk, I closed it every time I was not using it.. hinge broke when I was opening it. I googled it, it is a common problem with Lenovo, apparently the hinge is glued on, now I have to leave it open for fear the other hinge will snap too... then it will just lay flat.",0
"(Small, lightweight and well made): Very well designed Chromebook. We've had now for 5 months and have not had any issues with it. It's pretty fast in accessing the web, apps, etc. My daughter loves the screen size and how light it is.",0
"(Great. BUT small text size, consistently.): Works great, but text is too small. Hard to read at times. Hard to figure out how to make text bigger all the time on all web pages. Still not certain it's even possible. Don't buy, if you need larger text for tired eyes.",0
(Five Stars): Love it !,0
(Hands Down Best Laptop!): Never owned a Mac and now never going back to Windows. So smooth and fast with phenomenal battery life up to 8+ hours. Great screen as well with backlit keyboard. Easy to transfer files from Windows. This is money well spent replacing a 5+ years old slow heavy HP laptop!,0
"(BUY BUY BUY): Very quick laptop, fingerprint sensor works well and the backlit keyboard has 3 brightness settings. Love the laptop",0
"(Muy bien el producto ?): La computadora está muy padre y a mi hijo, le encantó por ser muy rápida ..",0
"(Great deal...): Holy c$%p, this laptop is a steal for what you get. It's an ASUS, it has a 10th generation i3 chipset, 8gb RAM and an M.2 hard drive. It needed a little tweaking with advanced power options bc it was glitching. The internet browser was freezing but changing power settings fixed it.. There are Youtube videos on ASUS viviobook lagging and you will find tips to remedy this. 5 minute easy fix that plagues most computers from the factory. This laptop is an amazing deal especially for the price and it would still be worth it if it was 500.00. The only negative to this computer is that the speakers are tinny and you will need to use external speakers if you use the audio frequently. Still...its a great laptop.",0
(Lightweight and Fast): I love how thin and sleek this was. I did have to use a repartitioning program to get the full 1tb on one partition.,0
"(You get what you paid for): Actually came sooner then expected, everything checks out good okurr.",0
(Me agrada): Me encanta,0
"(This is seriously a great gaming laptop): We got this for myself and my husband to use, to play graphically intensive PC video games.It arrives gift worthy and ready to plug in and update.It took about two hours to get the updates completed.It comes with very good directions that are easy to use and understand.It is a solid system.The housing feels durable.The sound system is on par with our high end speaker system.The screen feels protected and sturdy.the cooling system is quiet and works efficiently.They whole thing just feels well designed and built.We tested it out by installing our most graphically intensive game on to it.It is so intensive that we had to replace our desktop to play it due to the lag.This laptop played it on the most intensive settings with the most amount of detail, like it was playing spider solitaire.The imagery was perfection.The sound was immersive and really helped to draw us in.It was really amazing to see so much detail on a laptop.We would buy this again.",0
The AMD graphics card and processor surprised me with great performance / speed,0
"(Online Teaching!): I love this computer. I teach students in China English via webcam. This works perfectly. I'm able to run the teaching platform I work for and multiple web pages simultaneously. I love the fingerprint scanner, it makes logging in so fast. The computer is also very light and has a sleek design. I love the back light on the keyboard.",0
"(Garbage): Garbage.-After windows update, speakers stopped working.-function keys don't work.-load time at boot is atrocious.-load time for chrome is atrocious.Garbage. Returning. HP wasted my time and I'm pissed about it.",0
"I didn't want something huge and bulky like Alienware, and was afraid to get a brand from a less reputable manufacturer.",0
(Precio-Calidad): Muy buena laptop..!,0
"(Unfortunately, faulty from out of the box.): Not sure exactly what must've happened, but I guess I was one of the unlucky few who was given a botched version of this laptop. Right out of the box, it was completely unable to operate the webcam, no matter what I did to try and fix it. The trackpad would occasionally lose control and start acting very sluggish, sometimes for a minute or more, before snapping back to a normal speed. Various other glitches would arise, some of them lingering, some of them starting and stopping. What's going on?I can't say I'm exactly interested in the idea of explaining my problems one after the other to someone far away for an hour or more over the phone and hoping that I'm doing a good enough job at presenting my problems, while on top of that hoping that there's even a fix to my problems, while also on top of all that, hoping that the fix won't require me to send the laptop away. Right after getting it. Brand new. It's been an incredibly stressful couple of days...I really wanted to like this laptop, but there's just too many red flags already that even if I did manage to find fixes for the problems, I'm convinced it would be a matter of time before more arise. And then what? Is the warranty still in effect? Maybe not. Then I perhaps have no choice but to wait for days, weeks, while Acer has it and fixes it? What if I need it for work? And I'm hearing a lot about black screens? I don't know. I get anxious thinking about the whole process.Seems to me like if you enjoy gambling and don't mind figuratively rolling the dice, you could get sixes and land yourself a flawlessly functioning version of the Helios 300. Please don't get me wrong. I've heard TONS about how great this product is. It's what convinced me to seek it out. It does look very great, and I didn't even notice any serious backlight bleed, which I notice is a common complaint. But... I was not part of that group. I was stressing quite seriously about having spent the money I did, waiting, getting this, and immediately noticing there was no working webcam. Try some things. Still not working. Try more things. Still no. More. No. I had to stop myself sometimes, because it was so troublesome. The more time pass, the more I did, the more I wondered... Why is it this hard to get something so basic to work, in a laptop like this no less? Now the trackpad is giving me trouble? What is next?I can't give this one star, though my experience was unfortunately a very uncomfortable and frustrating one. The laptop still comes with impressive specs. It's just... I can't trust any of it to last. Not with this many problems on day one.I'm going to have to wait several days now (perhaps 14+ days after they get the laptop back) to get my refund and hopefully not repeat this process with another laptop in the near future. I'd seriously advise anyone who is looking into buying this to understand what they might be getting into. Emphasis on the word ""might"". Apparently, some people having glowing machines. I'm unfortunately among those who didn't...",0

No change after updating Windows. No change after resetting the laptop and reloading base installation of its software + drivers.An RMA with ASUS was approved and I shipped it in for repair.

"(USB-C Charger Failed Within 3 Months): My son needed a replacement Chromebook, so I picked this one up on ""Prime Day"". It has been a great replacement, but I was disappointed to learn from my son that it ""was no longer charging"". I decided to order a new charger and that has solved the problem, but I am disappointed that Samsung is packaging a bad charger with their product.Otherwise this Chromebook has been a good/decent chromebook. For those that know chromebooks, you know what that means. :)",0
"(Bad Hardware and No Warranty): Nice little laptop but had a USB-C port issue right out of the box. Not a big deal, I called HP Support and was told that the laptop was purchased 11/18 and the warranty expired 11/19. I just purchased the laptop last week! Apparently this vendor is pulling a fast by purchasing older products and then not notifying HP. I am not sure if this vendor is a certified HP reseller. I would steer clear and look elsewhere for HP products.",0
(Great computer.): Just what I was looking for and works great.,0
"(Case design flaw, bad timing): Overall, it's a capable laptop. Didn't benchmark great right out of the box, not a fan of the i/o placement. Which leads me to my situation. The power supply connector(never a fan of a barrel type connector) is unsupported by the case design and will sag, causing charging issues and eventual non charging, leading to costly repairs. I am in the latter camp having invested almost $1600 for a laptop that now sells for $1250(hence the bad timing)The angle of the case is aesthetic but short sighted. I have seen older laptops with a support ring around the power supply connecting port.Be aware of the design flaw IMO.",0
(Don’t do it!): Every thing about this laptop is not right.,0
"(Great!): Very pleased! It also arrived earlier than the tracking info provided, which was great!",0
"(Lightweight and fast): I like that it arrived sooner than I thought. It is much lighter than my old laptop, and much faster. I don't do a lot og gaming, but have had no problems with it . Glad to have purchased it.",0
(My first chromebook and I am impressed.): Only complaint is that the screen quality is poor in my opinion. Connected it to an external monitor and it is perfect. For the price it is darn good.,0
"(Light but durable awesome all round.): Awesome service delivery timed perfectly, brilliant product - have spent much time enjoying the features of this lightweight machine.",0
"(After only two months of mild usage, keyboard keys are broken): Great laptop, but very low quality keyboard. After two months of very mild usage the up down arrow keys have broke. This makes me feel bad about my purchase, as I cannot find part replacement for those anywhere.",0

(Poor screen resolution): Resolution is very poorCharger plugpins are flimsyCharging male connector is if poor quality,0
"(Exactly as described, 100% would recommend.): It is exactly what it says it is. It's great to play games on, or even edit videos.",0
"(A True Disappointment): I financed this laptop last month only to pay it off eighteen days later from moneys saved to purchase car tires. For several days it worked like a charm until it fell from a table onto a concrete floor with my Apple iPad Pro tablet. There were no scratches nor dents on my tablet; however, my NEW Lenovo Flex 5 took a serious beating! When facing the monitor, the left corner below the keyboard is permanently bent, and the frame has buckled on that side. The speaker still works, but it is now uncomfortable to rest my arm in that area. Yet, the product now belongs to me so I decided to continue using it to learn coding and to prepare teaching engineering to high school students this fall.Based on the published description of the laptop on Lenovo's official website, I figured it can handle The Sims 4 software and the three of its expansion kits on top of my education apps- boy was I wrong! Since loading the Sims 4, the Flex 5 takes longer to restart and to process commands. The quality went from a $650 Lenovo laptop to a $199 Dell Chromebook. A total disappointment indeed! The school district invested in a $1,500 Lenonovo laptop for my engineering courses; however, the weight is unbearable to hold in one arm after two minutes. The Flex 5 was going to work wonders due to having the capability to rotate the monitor behind the keyboard to convert it into a tablet. I just have to remind myself to remove the clear keyboard cover to prevent it from falling to the ground. The finger ID makes it convenient to log on; however, the processing speed is not what I expected. I should have waited and saved moneys to purchase another Apple Macbook Air, because my 2013 laptop fell onto concrete in the past and is still going strong without any physical damages.This purchase altered my perception of Lenovo by far, and I will consider purchasing a Samsung laptop the next go round. :-(",0

"(Buena inversión teniendo en cuenta el costo): Estoy satisfecho con la compra, tardó 1 semana en llegar a Costa Rica, menos del tiempo estimado muy rápido! Es una muy buena opción tomando en cuenta el precio por el tipo de máquina que es, le daré uso para la universidad y algunos juegos casuales. La pantalla es excelente y si bien, en algunos comentarios indican lo contrario debido a los ángulos de visión, la verdad no es un factor que me afecte ya que la utilizo en un escritorio, es cuestión de gustos.Con respecto al sonido, siempre se ha sabido que las portátiles tienen un sonido estándar, para mejor audio, compras unos parlantes y listo! Si quieres una laptop algo exigente, hay otras opciones a mayor precio. De momento 0 quejas con la máquina es una excelente opción, la recomiendo para aquellas personas que no deseen gastar mucho y busquen algo decente para estudio y algunos juegos casuales.",0
This is a great laptop for the price.,0
"(Muy buena opción en relación calidad - precio.): Tiene todo lo necesario para una persona que la utilice para estudiar, de oficina, herramientas básicas y demás. El táctil funciona muy bien.

"(2018 New HP Chromebook 11.6 Model # 11-v025wm is not compatible with Google Play Store app): Be aware that this Chromebook Model # 11-v025wm (linked below) is not compatible with the Google Play Store app. While you are able to access the Play Store from the internet, you cannot download applications to the Chromebook. This was confirmed by first attempting to download applications and then speaking with HP technical support.If using Google Play Store is not a factor for you, the laptop may be okay for general internet use and to access programs on the internet.If it is an issue, the HP tech cited these two consumer HP Chromebook Model #s as being compatible with Google Play Store - 1) HP X360-11 and 2) HP X2-12. I don't know if these are bonafide models, but am passing these details along.The tech also cited the HP Chromebook HP 11G5 as a commercially available model and could not confirm its compatibility with Play Store. However, I'd previously purchased one and it was compatible, but I had to send it back because the touchpad was not consistently working.Overall, if compatibility matters to you, I would suggest doing your own research to make sure the laptop has the features you desire. Looking at the official Google Chromebooks blog for updated listings of Chromebooks compatible with Google Play Store may help.Chromebook not compatible with Google Play Store from my experience:",0
"(Great experience): Shipping was great, product was as advertised. Would recommend them to others.",0
"(Beyond Stunned): My only regret is not purchasing this computer sooner. Bought it to replace a laptop HP that is less than a year old that was an utter disappointment. It cost twice as much as the Acer and far less nimble or ready for anything of significance. It is basically just a great paperweight. The Acer, however, out of the box is lightening fast and incredibly easy to maneuver. The keyboard has a nice bounce and I'm loving having the numeric keypad - highly unusual for a laptop!Here's what I didn't expect which was incredibly nice to have:1. That annoying webcam peep-hole...Acer provides a couple of plastic covers so you can keep it covered when not in use and open it when you need to show your beautiful face. Now, HP never provided anything like that!2. They even supply screws for the installation of an additional internal hard drive, should you make such a purchase. Now, how sweet is that?! I would not have an idea how to do that but I did appreciate the thought.More than anything, the machine has just been solid as a rock and has not flinched at any level. If there's any regret, it's the fact that Windows 11 is installed in some odd security mode which makes installing the drivers for printers and other devices nearly impossible. Having to maneuver all of that was more of a headache than anything else and that's a Microsoft issue, having nothing to do with Acer. Once Windows 11 safe mode is uninstalled, it's smooth sailing.Details matter and Acer won me on the details, quality and sturdiness of this computer. Will certainly look to buy more Acers in the future. I am extremely happy with this purchase and incredibly sorry I did not consider this brand in the past. Won't make that same mistake again.Highly recommend! In fact, I just might buy another one for work...",0

(Definitely wroth the price!!!): If your looking for a laptop that’s not a Mac book with a good price this is the one. I purchased laptops from amazon and after a couple weeks it stopped working but with this laptop it’s light weight brand new you and I had no problems so far so good you won’t regret it.,0
(Que buen rendimiento): Lo estuve testeando por qué no era para mí a mí gusto la pantalla deja que desear pero el procesador muy bien probé algúnos juegos regulares y no pesta?eo la compré por el procesador y precio que tenía la verdad es que casi no juego pero si soporta estos juegos sin problemas podrás trabajar muy bien con ella,0

(No ethernet port): I forgot to check for the ethernet port. it's so important to have one as wifi is not great all the time everywhere. nice laptop though. was able to purchase an adapter usb to ethernet. cool,0
"(Not working properly upon opening.): Upon initial set up, immediately after opening, cannot read the screen. Has double information (like double screen?) which makes it so you cannot clearly see any of it. Pink & Green? what its that? The ""free help line"" we tried to contact would not answer the phone unless you paid $14.50 to talk to them! Returning this ASAP.",0
"(Good laptop for a great price): Fast start up. Keyboard is perfect size,just like my old acer. Best part is the price.",0
(Happy Customer): It was a gift for my father in law and he lives it.. TY,0
"(Like I said): This is a 5 star product given what it is for the price point. So why only 1 star? I will remove this review if all works out with returning and/or repairing. However, for now I can only give 1 star because it radomly crashes on me! And you have to hold the power key for 20+ seconds to restart and then redo whatever you were working on. Only happens a few times a week and it may be due to needing updates for some of the software...so stay tuned. I saw someone else with the same problem. Not sure if this is an exception or a trend. Like I said, will bump to 5 stars if I decide to return and that goes smoothly or it magically stops crashing on me...Bigger picture. This is exactly what they say it is for an amzing price. If you are in the mood for a cheap and super lightweight and portable chromebook with excellent battery life and super fast internet connection then this is a good buy, just as long as they software issues do not continue!",0

(I’m a fan): Besr purchase for the money.,0
"(Amazing performance--runs Valve Index--great deal): I needed a laptop that could run the Valve Index, for a super cool art project that I got a grant for. After many, many hours of researching laptops and one whole purchase-and-return of an Alienware machine, I got this one. It runs its video right off the graphics card through the mini DispalayPort and it handles the hard specs of the Index amazingly well. And it does it for cheap. GET IT GET IT GET IT!",0
"(Mediocre build quality causes overheating.): At first glance this seems like a great laptop with decent specs, and the price is attractive. However, once I used it for a few days the corners that asus cut to make this price possible emerged. The housing of the laptop is very thin aluminum, this allows the heat from the processor and graphics card to dissappate without using a built in fan. This causes the laptop to overheat and the bottom becomes so hot it can't be placed on one's lap. Probably as a result of the heat, the battery started to deteriorate and after just 2 weeks it wasn't holding a proper charge, I was forced to return this laptop. Maybe I got a bad egg, and not all of these laptops have overheating problems. Next time I'll just stick with Dell. Amazon as usual were exceptional in their support and I got a refund no problem.",0

"(Barely three months in and the computer won't even boot properly.): This laptop is great at doing what it does when it works. Unfortunately, despite taking good care of it, it seems that plugging in one more USB than I usually do bricked it.",0
"(Terrible customer service, screen has a grid lines and computer keeps crashing): Screen has a grid lines and computer keeps crashing after 5 months of use. Battery will die after 2 hours. Spent 3 hours on the phone, spent 2 hours waiting in a tech to work on the computer, just to be told they think there's sign of a spill, so they won't repair it.Parts for the screen and memory which were already diagnosed as the issue, were here but not installed, and I was told I would have to send it into the warehouse to get repaired, and cost would be given at that time.There was never any spill I can remember, so if it is spill damage, it was likely something happened to fall on the back of it where all of the important stuff is apparently easily accessible for liquids.TLDR: terrible design especially vulnerable to spills, terrible customer service from Lenovo, not worth the costsEdit: The repair tech also managed to crack the screen when he was working on it, so now it's unusable.Follow-up: Tried to charge me $300 to repair the screen they broke.",0
"(Absolutely OUTSTANDING gaming laptop; a BEAST of a business laptop.): I will preface this review by saying that I am not much of PC gamer since I have a PS5, but I was in the market for a new laptop as we go into another year of working from home. I am in AWE of how fast, powerful and well-designed this baby is. The screen is big and has excellent display. The graphics are top notch, which is helpful to me as I take on more graphic design responsibilities for work, and the it has a very fast processor with more than enough storage and memory, that can even be upgraded to 32GB. For now the 16GB is sufficient but I love having that options. They keyboard is wonderful to type on and being able to use both Wifi and Ethernet connections at the same time means there is NOTHING that will stop you on it! There is a cooling mechanism on the bottom of the laptop for the hardcore gaming marathons so the machine runs efficiently no matter what you put it up to and it is integrated with Alexa so you have a personal assistant at the ready too!The laptop IS very expensive but the investment you make in a high-end, high-performance machine means that you will not only be able to upgrade it but also will have it for years with no problems. I am so delighted with this laptop!",0
(Five Stars): Really good so far.,0
(Good quality): Satisfy my needs,0
(Excellent): Solid computer.,0
(Best purchase from Amazon): I’ve been wanting a MacBook for the longest and when I came across this I was very suspicious about it but read the reviews and gave it a shot!! And so happy I did even tho my first one was stolen from Amazon but I called right away once I was alert my package may have been lost and they was able to send me out another one with no problem so I thank Amazon for that!!!,0
"(Love it!): It was time for an upgrade, the finger scanner and the number pad are awesome. I love ASUS products and I was not disappointed with this one. The speakers are ok, the backlit keyboard is great and the price is not bad at all, the battery life is eh… would recommend.",0

(Overheating just past return deadline): We used this as a work computer for an associate located remotely. She started having issues with it overheating on her desk. Unfortunately this happened just past the return deadline in September. It lasted about 5 weeks.,0
"(Love it): This new Mac is more powerful than all previous versions, runs silent (no fans), dissipates heat under the heaviest of loads with no throttling, and does so while lasting 48 hours on a chafe and being almost as light as your phone.People taking about M1 being an issue either don’t know enough to figure it out or are straight lying. Everything works fine.If you’re looking to upgrade, you can’t go wrong with this.",0
"(Runs really hot, even while simply browsing): this is quite a laptop. we've never owned a gaming laptop before, but we've had several gaming PC's over the years, but this was the first gaming laptop we've owned. It's been quite the experience.First and foremost this this is heavy. If you actually are using this while sitting down on the couch, it leaves deep indents in my legs when i sit down with it. On top of that it gets ridiculously hot, really fast. even just browsing around on the internet this thing heats up really quickly. i ended up getting a cooling dock i could put this on when i was sitting with it, but that just made it even more heavy, and the dock didn't do much to alleviate the heat emanating from this thing.This thing also has a Huge power brick. My older dell laptops back in the day had this tiny little power brick, this thing is massive. I get that it must be to power this type of laptop, but sheesh, it takes up a bit of space.I will say it runs really quietly. I was surprised by how quiet it was with how hot this gets. i figured the harder it was working, it would be louder, but it's surprisingly quiet.Now to the gaming aspect. It will run games on the highest settings, and run them well. I had this at one point hooked up to my tv in the living room, so i could play Horizon on steam. It ran this game like a champ. the picture quality on it was amazing. We've played WOW on this and it's run at over 120 fps in the larger cities with a bunch of other characters around. overall playing games on this has been amazing. it really does handle gaming well.it has connection points for 4 USB, 2 Monitors, ethernet, audio jack, and SD card.I think one of my other complaints is how quickly this thing will die on you if not plugged in. the battery gets drained rather quickly, even if all you're doing is browsing on the internet.so overall i would say, that this is a fairly solid laptop, with a few minor issues. we got this for gaming, and for gaming it's great. portability is a bit much with how heavy this thing is, and battery life could be better. but overall, i would recommend this.",0
(Good laptop): Good laptop,0
"(LIFELONG APPLE USER: Amazing Laptop, Not Great Speaker 9.9/10): I've ALWAYS had Macs and have never considered PC's till my Macbook died. I then bought an HP with better specs than this laptop, and am returning the HP because this MSI laptop is just that much better. I've only had this laptop for 2 weeks and so far it's worth every penny. I don't use it for gaming but the CPU speed is amazing, everything is quick. I use Ableton for Music Production and require a laptop that can process tons of different moving parts at the same time. Ableton is running better than ever on this, I haven't had any CPU crashes or overloads whatsoever. The only reason this isn't the perfect laptop for me is the speaker. The laptop's speaker quality is very mediocre. Granted, the laptop audio quality is stellar. When plugged into headphones or other speakers, it sounds great. I just wish the speakers on the laptop gave a better quality sound. Nonetheless, it's worth it.",0
(Clearance for a reason!): Very slow processor and annoying cursor delay!,0
"(Missing keys?): Good computer for the value. It was simple to set up. I use it primarily to watch online, so cannot speak to the functionality.The only thing I find curious about the computer is it has no delete, home or end keys. These keys are useful when typing.",0
"(Solid Form and Functionality): Very happy with it so far. Love the matte finish and coming from a Zbook 17, this is like a feather; super light, but without feeling flimsy. The three mouse buttons below the keyboard are absolutely make or break for me for two handed navigation so very happy here, though I do feel that it doesn't always register some clicks. Also a bit disappointed that the function and control keys, though swappable, aren't physically swappable due to the different key sizes (with the control key coming up short after the BIOS swap).Otherwise the battery life is fantastic, typing on the keyboard is enjoyable, and no complaints about the trackpad. The home and end keys, which I use frequently while coding, are in about a good a position as they can be I suppose, given the area limitation.Lastly, the IR camera for face sign in is a subtle but lovely feature that almost makes me forget that it's doing any ""signing in"" at all. After a couple of times registering my face, it's very quick at recognizing me.All in all very happy with the purchase and am enjoying going about as far on a single charge as I do with my phone.",0

"(This is the gaming laptop you want!): I bought a Asus TUF, Acer Nitro 5 and the Legion...yes the Legiom does cost a bit more than the other two but it’s a significant bump in quality and performance. The other two laptops have decent internals, but the build quality left a lot to be desired, the web cam on the Nitro died after one day and when I tried to install a 2nd storage drive in the TUF, the m.2 slot broke off. The Legion has no issues like this, nor would I expect it to, it feels extremely solid and durable. The fans are noticeable under load but not too loud and excessive heat is never an issue. Performance is as good as you can get at this price point and the screen looks pretty amazing. The best part is the warranty, it’s a 1yr in home repair (can be extended) and you can add accidental damage for less than $20/yr.",0
the keyboard lights are nice,0
(Love it!): Purchased HP to replace one that was having issues with and I am Really pleased with. I am really happy with this HP laptop.,0
(Its good but..): This thing is a beast but it takes too much work to get it setup and the fans just howl over any little thing. If you know how to handle something this powerful Im sure it can be awesome.,0
"(No nonsense laptop): Consider my rating a 3 1/2, I was torn between a 3 and 4. This is not for the person looking for something to handle some heavy computing, this is the kind of laptop that companies will buy in bulk for their employees. The first thing you will notice is the thin profile and heavy solid construction with very little flex and a kind of cool matte black finish and diamond pattern that looks a lot like a carbon fiber pattern.The specs are on the low end including the only 8GB of memory and apparently no way to upgrade the memory. The CPU isn't bad but they are expecting it to do a lot of the work, Most would not consider 8GB memory enough for a Windows 10 machine and is likely to hurt the lifetime as a viable laptop.The diamond pattern is repeated on the inside. The touchpad is a little sloppy and registers touches easily, so easily it registered touches I did not want it to and sometimes the wrong result all together. The buttons need to be clicked on the far right or left edge. I was able to adjust the sensitivity but what was interesting in a search about adjusting the sensitivity, adjusting the sensitivity on a Dell laptop came up before the generic adjusting the sensitivity search so this is apparently an issue with Dell laptops. The keyboard is large and has a satisfying feel and another nice thing was the symbols have a different texture than the margins so you are still able to see the symbols even when there is a reflection on the keys.There is a good amount of bloatware including McAffee, I was able to remove the McAffee. There is also a lot of startup red tape. It has a solid state drive but I wasn't sure until I looked to see what the drive was, I actually thought it was a disc drive, it seemed slow. I got just under 4 hours battery life watching movies on Amazon, I would guess you would get 6 to 8 hours battery life for less battery intensive uses, I will update if I get a more exact number. It takes about 3 hours to charge with a dead battery. The screen wasn't the best, it had a very limited viewing angle and you will notice image deterioration if you vary a little off the angle, this is more noticeable watching movies. I like this as a business or school laptop but not for other applications. It comes with a free month of Office.",0
(Manufacturer Warranty Not Honored): Screen cracked within first 4 months of purchase. Warranty not honored by HP when sent in for repair.,0
(Fast and simple): Super easy to set up if you have a gmail account. Fast browsing speed.,0
"There is no back light on the keyboard, which is misleading and so frustrating.",0
"(Reliable for light functions): I got this refurbished for about 100$, had to get windows 10 s off of it to run non-windows store apps. I’m using it as a console for Stepmania, and I’d highly recommend it to be a cheap emulator, or basic word processor / tablet style computer.",0
(Everything I need): Use this laptop for work-no touchscreen-speed and battery life exceed my needs-ACER brand has not let me down yet and this is my 3rd one-definitely recommend the brand,0
(Had to return - item did not work): Had to return the second it arrived. The box said Walmart on it and the laptop didn’t work. Amazon was very quick in refunding. Five star for the delivery and service but the item was unfortunately not working,0
"(Fast and well built): Works fine, no complains as at now. I use it for CAD applications and not gaming.",0
"(Nice Lap Top!): Delivered as promised, good price, this is my second Asus that I had bought.",0
(Junk with NO Support): The computer stopped working after five weeks. Amazon refused to make their vendor Samsung stand behind their inferior product. Don't believe Samsung's 90 day warranty as in reality you have no warranty. Samsung's products are so poorly made that they can't afford to warranty them. I would look elsewhere.,0
(Computer): My 12 year old is very satisfied with it. Uses it everyday to play games with friends and to do schoolwork. A little higher priced than I wanted to pay!,0
"(Slow processing speed and touchscreen is lacking): This chromebook is slow, and touchscreen is not very responsive. Also, the chromebook operating system is not ideal for people who need shortcuts on the desktop to navigate their device. If you are familiar with chromebooks and like the operating system this wont be an issue, but for those used to the easy navigation of a windows device, it may be. Overall, I would have been willing to work with the operating system had the device not taken a good 15-30 seconds to load each application that I attempted to open",0
"It defaults to this nice breathing ripple, and has a bunch of other cool settings.",0

"(Got the 7 GPU model despite different description): Nowhere was it mentioned that this is the castrated 7 GPU Core version. Feeling deceived. In addition, the 8 GB RAM / 256GB SSD Version is nigh useless for anything beyond websurfing. Having multiple apps open concurrently almost immediately yields the spinning beach ball of death. With a regular set of apps, like the MS Office suite, the disk fills up in no time. Now OS updates are not working, since they require at least 15 GB disk space. But - battery life is out of this world, with the CPU temp sitting at 36C!",0
"(HPs dont see or connect to hot spots!): Does not connect to hotspots!! After purchasing and not being able to connect to my hotspot, I did research. Big problem with HPs. Not sure why, can see and connect to wifi networks, but not hotspots. If you travel alot, or use hotspots for internet as we.do fornall our internet. This computer is garbage.

"(Great gaming laptop for the price): I needed a new laptop that I could use for gaming and for medical school. It's pretty heavy, but not as much as I expected for how sturdy it is. The screen has a little bit of a glare, but is fast for my games and the color is correct enough for my diagrams for school. For the specs, you aren't going to find much better of a laptop for this price. Very happy with my purchase so far! It does get a little hot, but again, with the chassis as small as it is, I expected it. I usually prop it up on a coaster or something to let the fans on the bottom work. The sound from the speakers isn't that great, but I mostly use it with headphones anyways. I have also heard the battery life isn't that great for gaming, but I haven't had any issues yet. It lasts for hours while I'm studying, and I usually have it plugged in for heavy gaming. Like I said, for the price, not much else can compare.",0
(Nice performance!): Love my new computer! I never dreamed of having a gaming computer ? because I don't play that kind of games. I had to have a high graphics to run 3 D printing software for work. This computer is great for this.,0
"(Durable): For a $200 device, the Chromebook 3's build quality is surprisingly good, even though it's made of plastic. The Chromebook 3 has the ports you need. On the left side, there is a battery indicator, a slim jack for the AC adapter, a USB 2.0 port, a full-size HDMI port, and a microSD card slot. The backspace key is just below the power key, so you're just an accidental keystroke away from accidentally shutting down the machine :/. Although the Samsung Chromebook 3 can easily last a full workday on a charge. The underside of the Samsung Chromebook 3 gets a bit warm. Overall the Samsung laptop is a good choice for students and anyone who primarily uses their laptop to surf the web.",0
"(Good BUT): Same with other reviewers, there's no backlit keyboard as this is a very important feature to me and is what my main search was for since I am used to it with my last laptop. The other thing I'm worried about is how it was shipped, it came in the new box, but it was put inside a larger box with room to get tossed around inside it and had no bubble wrap or anything and we all know how our packages are treated by the delivery services so who know how much it was tossed around. That concerns me for long term use. Also expected a C-type charger but got a 3 prong round plug in which I dislike. Why HP, why? It's a nice laptop for the price I got it but sending it back for the main reason of the backlit keyboard. I'm very picky! And the search continues...",0

(Powerful and productive laptop): This laptop is easy to work on. The screen is large and resolution is exceptional. Battery lasts for 5 hours of hardcore continal use.,0
(Disappointed!): I've had this Asus for only a few months. Sometimes when I am typing the text will not appear until later; the sound quality is horrible; I have to frequently restart the laptop because it freezes up or the sound will stop working completely; using the pen is difficult. It takes a lot of effort for some reason.Overall the Asus Zenbook fails. I paid attention to the reviews before purchasing and what I got was not what I read about. I started noticing small issues almost immediately and it has accumulated. I want my money back.,0
"(Great for basic needs, but battery life is a lie): I get about 4.5 hours out of a full charge, and all i do is word processing and audio books. 11 hours seems like an impossibility unless there is something i am completely missing.",0
You cannot charge it from its USB-C port,0
"(This Computer is just what I needed): I bought this lap top early last year. It had all of the specs I wanted and although it lacked reviews at the time, I had seen reviews for similar HP laptops and decided to risk it. I think that was overall a good decision.The laptop is very fast with booting and loading. I use it mostly for browsing and streaming, which is great. For the past 4 months, I have started to use it for online gaming, League of Legends. This computer is not a gaming lap top, and so I have to operate the game on the lightest settings possible, and have little else running in the background in order to play. It still functions well for my purposes. I don't have internet connectivity issues causes by the laptop. The only problem is how hot it gets when I play games and sometimes when windows uses lots of processing power in the background. The fan gets loud at those times.Overall, I am happy with this computer, it is light weight and portable, so easy to carry to work. It's thinness doesn't seem to make it that fragile. I bang my bag around sometimes without noticing and occasionally spill things on or near the mouse pad, but it has survived my clumsiness. I have found that any computer problems I have had this past year were caused by software and reparable with research. I was worried about overloading the laptop and damaging the hardware when I started gaming, but it hasn't slowed down at all when I use it for work and streaming.",0
"(Computer doesn't work right out of the box): Computer just restarts itself over and over right out of the box. Waiting on a replacement, may update.",0
"(Perfect for what i need!): This is my second Chromebook since my first one broke from a fall. After numerous days of research this is definitely a great Chromebook for the money the display is excellent and the keyboard works well I also like the fact this includes an HDMI port. Battery life last around 9 hours and it is extremely light. The speakers which are on the bottom put out good sound. Do some research before you buy because a Chromebook though it can do a lot is not a PC but for the price and what it does do is completely worth it. Browse the web, word, excel, and spreadsheet Google alternatives and cloud storage work excellent. Does not need an internet connection to do everything and anything dive offline will be saved and uploaded once you connect to wifi. One thing I which it has was a modem port, but I have an old laptop in the event I need to make changes to my modem.",0
"(Can run games like Valorant really smoothly): Got this laptop for school because of Covid-19. on my off time, i get to play a lot of video games from Valorant to Nier: Automata. I never encountered any issue besides trying to get to the fans to clean it. Some games can go beyond 60 fps like Valorant, but games like fortnite and Nier: Automata it’s fixed at 60 fps, but i really don’t worry for my frames. I do encounter some frame drops not very often but if that’s not your cup of tea, consider another laptop.",0
"(Could be better): The laptop is decent but what im upset about is the camera quality its pretty bad for. 1,000$ gaming laptop battery isnt the best but as expected for a gaming laptop.",0

(Died 1 year after purchase): Laptop was bought for my grandson and it died almost exactly a year from when we bought it. Windows looked him out and factory reset wouldn't work.,0
"(Seemingly Great Bargin): 09-30-19 Just received these today so take this review in stride as I usually try and update my reviews every couple months on expensive purchases like these. I bought two of these, they came at a great price, and right NOW I'm loving them. For me the screen size and picture quality are great. No issues as others seemed to have with resolution. My kids (11 and 12) are familiar with them because they use similar devices at school. They're seemingly fast, efficient and user friendly. They came ready to use right out of the box and limited effort on my part needed to be exerted to place monitoring controls on them.10-7-19 So, I haven't even had these products a week and one of the units wont turn on and will not hold a charge. I've contacted the customer support team (located in India i.e. thick accents) these individuals are extremely difficult to understand, talk fast, and I ""lost connection"" twice. Long story short I have to wait for a shipping label, go to a fed ex store, send it in for repairs and wait 7 to 10 business days for those repairs to be made. This unit is my daughter's so you can imagine how thrilled she'll be about all of this.10-30-19So, I went to the fed-ex store to ship these back. I had to purchase a special box for the chromebook, that cost $25, as shipping it in the box it came in and bubble wrap wouldn't protect it completely. It came back within the 7 to 10 business days as promised.....in a different box, upside down and wrapped in bubble wrap. Seriously?!?!?? Anyway it's working right now.",0
Battery life is decent for the specs.,0
(NO POWER ADAPTER.): This item arrived without the power adapter!!. The box was not sealed!!!,0
"(It's good but....): I have this laptop for a year now. (Bought it in July 2020) I first got it, it was great. After 2 months, I start to heard fan noise. I open it up, but there hardly any dust. So I clean the fan and put everything back. Then it was good for 2 weeks. After that, it start making the fan noise again. So, I open it up and check the metal fan( it was the one making all the noise). There were no dust or anything that can cause it to make that loud noise. I do some research on why it's making that noise. It said if you clean it already and it still making that noise from time to time, then replace that fan. The metal fan(which is the Aeroblade 3D) will make the noise when starting up, but it stop making it after 15 or 20 minutes later. It's been going on like this for a while now.Today on September 18, 2021, I open it up to do the monthly clean. Once I put everything back after 15 or 20 minutes later, it won't stop making the sound anymore. So now, I have to buy a new fan to replace it.Gaming is really good. I can play most of the games with my friend them. When playing with charger plug in, I recommend changing the games setting so that you can play at its best without overheating it.",0
(Happy Purhase): My old Chromebook was getting old and this is a replacement. Glad I did. This new one is better. Five year old electronics generally have a better new edition.,0

"(From excitement to breakdown): got very excited when got it, open and plug in the charger and turned it on. worked for 30 minute to an hour (not too sure) then suddenly the screen went black. the keyboard is still lit up, but the screen was just completely dead black. i turned it off then on, noticing only the keyboard working (lights up) but the fan stops working after a few seconds and screen still black. i check the charger and see that the laptop is charging so nothing wrong there. i tried to look up solutions and tutorials and called the company, but nothing worked. they told me to send it to them to repair it, but my parents disagreed and wants to return it. not sure what to do since i only have to option which’s to return it or keep looking up solutions. i really wanna keep this laptop since i’ve always kept my eye on it but i’m going through a mental breakdown trying to fix it on my own with my parents not supporting the idea of sending it to the company for them to repair and rather return it. if someone has a solution on here please help me ?.",0
"(Nice overall laptop): There is a lot to like with the laptop. The build feels solid enough. When you lift the lid, I don't feel any wiggle between the screen and the frame. It's heavy and solid. The power adapter is definitely a beast.Screen is great. Nice and bright. Easy to read.The keyboard is nice as well. Large enough. Plus a ten key. So good for overall use if you use the ten key. I don't but I know that some people really prefer it. Especially if they're not gaming. The lights on the keyboard are slightly distracting but can be adjusted.I think this is a good overall laptop, even for business. As a desktop replacement, it's got enough power to get the job done. For gaming, there's always something more powerful around the corner but this is good enough to get the job done.",0

"(Shipped with Broken Fan and Windows 10 S Mode): I wanted to like this laptop, and initially I was excited to use it. Immediately upon opening the shipping box I noticed that it was labeled on the physical laptop that it ran windows 10 in S mode. What this means is that any function, download, or App that is not curated from the Microsoft Store will not run in the computer. One can turn off S mode pretty easily but it negatively impacts the speed and performance of the laptop. The specs that the laptop advertises are generated when using S mode, so when turning off S mode, the qualifications the laptop sold you on, can be incorrect. I do not want this feature, and my problem is that this feature was not displayed accurately or, well, even at all on this store page. Had it been mentioned and accurately advertised that this computer ran in S mode, I would not have purchased it.That by itself wouldn't have warranted a review, but this laptop at the time of me writing this, is less than 24 hours old and I'm being notified during the boot sequence that a broken fan (90B) is being detected and continued use of the laptop will result in possible system failure (it will break the system). The fact that this laptop shipped broken, with an obvious fan issue, pushes me to attempt to get a refund. I didn't want to spend time on this, I have enough already in my day but I can't waste money on faulty products and can't spend more to fix something that should have been 100% functional when it was shipped to me. This is probably an unusual event for these laptops, and honestly if it wasn't for the broken fan I would have been content, but again, can't throw money at things that should have worked on reception.",0
"(Much more machine than any Chromebook!): Fast, light, good battery life. Not using it for big number crunching, but good for small business. I’m not a gamer, so can’t speak to that. However Windows 11 is nice.",0
"(Hinge is breaking; keyboard LEDs broke; and Nahimic audio driver is horrible.): I won't buy this again. Very poor quality. Mine is now permanently fixed to a desk, as opening and closing the lid is breaking the case apart due to a poor case design. All the LEDs on the keyboard are dead. And the Nahimic audio driver is like a virus - I keep having to disable it because it wrecks all the audio (youtube videos especially have a hissing/stuttering sound when they start indicating somehow Nahimic managed to start running again)! Total crap I am not happy with this purchase and will not buy or recommend MSI again.",0

"(Has the power but…): It’s still missing some of the key features us gamers want. Like getting rid of that dumb touchpad hybrid thing they implemented into the new versions. Very buggyWhere did the camera go, I can’t remember last time I’ve seen Asus’s aurous line have one. Still has everything like great screen and keyboard but no camera…Bad graphics implementation with built in Radeon graphics. Computer can get confused and will if you got a bigger display or more then one of them. Mainly nvidia could control that all but radeon also controls some of the laptop as well, so more settings to adjust besides NvidiaBesides that all, Laptop runs good. Fans are quiet. Auto fan curve is good enoughThe rtx packs a punch in games that use them",0
"(Fast machine and easy to set up/configure): Love the lightweight and easy to set up/configure capabilities. This is my first MAC although I have iPads and an Apple watch.

"(Terrible material and quality): This laptop is terrible as far as durability is concerned. The screen broke while I applied very light pressure as I was installing a screen protector. Furthermore, I traveled with this laptop and while in a laptop friendly Backpack where the laptop was securely placed and didn’t move. The keypad broke down and wasn’t working.Looks like the material and durability is very weak. Which very uncharacteristic for an asus laptop. Don’t buy this laptop unless u plan on not moving and keep this on the same place. The quality and DURABILITY IS VERY DISAPPOINTING",0
"(Great Gaming Laptop on a budget): Tl;dr: The MSI GL65 is a great gaming laptop for the price and well worth your money.Overall: The GL65 is a great machine for semi-portable gaming. The battery will last a while for normal tasks but don’t expect it to last more than an hour (most likely less than 40 minutes) while playing games requiring the graphics card.Pros: The list is too long of the pros for this laptop, but the primaries are the RTX2070, 10th gen Intel i7, and NVMe SSD. This combination provides for running most games currently available at maximum settings and still get a respectable 50-60 FPS.Cons: Crapware. This is actually the only reason I removed a star from the rating. I would gladly pay extra, and have, to not be forced to remove lots of, what I consider to be, useless software. By far the worst offender on the list of crapware preinstalled is Norton. This software has absolutely no place on a gaming laptop because it uses far more resources than it should for the benefit it provides. As a professional IT person, I recommend and use Eset for computer security.",0

"Small, lightweight pretty looking and powerful with lots of speed.",0
(A): Perfecta,0
(Okay): Nothing special. Features missing to cut cost.,0
(Fast and furious): When we received the laptop it was well packaged and very impressive looking. When powered up however the screen did not work. As if there was no back lighting. If you shine a light on the screen you could see that there was in fact something on it but it was too dark to see and the brightness did not adjust. Asus warranty was quick to resolve this and fix it at no charge. Now it’s up and running perfectly. So fast! The colorful RGB lights just set the whole thing off. Awesome looking. The camera quality is fantastic as well. This is great for gaming or for gaming working when I need multiple processes running at once. I’m very happy with it and it’s exactly what I would expect in a gaming laptop at this price point.,0
"(DONT BUY THIS MODEL ! ASUS needs to recall these things and figure this out !): So this review is EXTREMELY unfortunate to give ! I buy LOTS of products off amazon and over the years this is probably my 2nd review I’ve ever actually written . And I only do it because I feel obligated to warn people until ASUS pulls this product or gives a free extended warranty with it to ALL customers ! I love the look of this laptop and the build quality is great as far as materials used for screen and case , and I really love the look of it . It’s way nicer looking in person too ! I read a lot of bad reviews and took a gamble . I lost . This laptop is nothing but manufacturing defects in motherboard and software. Fans ran full blast 6700rpm right out the box , light keys didn’t work right either . And trust me I tried everything . Mine came down to a bad motherboard . I’m getting full refund so I’m at no loss , it’s just disappointing because I really loved the style of this laptop and wanted it to work out . Digging much much deeper into the issues , I have read COUNTLESS reviews of people having the same issues and worse . Seams to be mostly with these new models of ROG laptops . Clearly something went horribly wrong during manufacturing and they won’t admit it . Funny thing is , I read a review that was several months old saying “ ASUS told him they haven’t had any other complaints of this issue and they are surprised to hear about it “ and I was told the same thing by ASUS as well when I 1st called for help trying to fix the issues . I told him that’s funny because I am now reading reviews after reviews on line of people having the SAME problems . With no fix . Everyone being put through a long process of installing this and that and updating this and that , resetting the computer and doing it all again . Just to come to the same conclusion that the motherboard is bad and if I send it in they will change it out and send it back . Unfortunately I didn’t pay this much for a refurbished unit . I don’t want to bash ASUS as a whole , but it’s definitely not ok with this new ROG line in 2019 . I can’t speak for the scar 3 but personally , after this , I will not gamble on that now especially when I’d have to fork out another $500 or so for the 3 . One good thing I can say though all of this , is amazon is great at handling it and refunding everything or doing whatever I want to do to resolve it . A big reason I only buy PRIME products . It’s very rare I ever have a issue buying from amazon , but when I do they take care of me . I don’t mess around and wait to deal with the issue . Some people do and want to use the products for awhile defected and then try returning last minute and get a hassle sometimes because it’s then warn in some cases . Anyways , DONT BUY THIS ASUS PRODUCT . I’d advise to wait another year for them to work this issue out ! Good luck with your purchase decisions ! I’m probably going to go for the hp omen 15 as it was my 2nd option . All the hp split talk is a little nerve racking but I think it will all work out in the end .",0

(Good Computer): I m happy with my purchase,0
(Quality control - Video Camera issues): From opening and closing the laptop various times the wire for the video camera fails if you don’t have it at a certain viewing angle. I didn’t do my research properly but the video camera wire is notorious for failing in this particular modal.,0
(Wife loves it): Bought for wife and she loves it.,0
(ok): did not come with the sd card that was supposed to come,0
"(for $999 it's one of the best tech deals of my life): What can I say, the laptop is amazing, the screen is 99% RGB, the CPU Ryzen R7 5800h is a monster, the rtx 3050ti with just 4gb of vram is a horrible thing, but still you can't even build a desktop more powerful than this thing for $999, I added 16gb extra ram to a total of 24gb and also a 1tb SSD to a total of 1.5tb SSD this laptop is great for games like red dead redemption 2, GTA v, Doom eternal, but the best thing for me is video editing, it's like 3x faster than my i7 7700k, but this thing is a laptop! You can manually set the tdp limits to make it run really cool and silent when you need it, or Max fans and Max power when you just want UNLIMITED POWAAAAA! 8 cores 16 threads @4.4ghz on a laptop was beyond dreaming just 3 years ago, I really love AMD, the rtx is severely castrated with those 4gb vram but still with dlss and fsr I'm sure it will handle anything for at least 5 years to come",0
I am old fashioned and like typing with a number pad way better than using the upper keys on a keyboard.,0
"(very good laptop): for the price point this laptop is a good value, I have own many HP laptops and they have given me many years of great service",0
"The GS75 is a very powerful laptop that is surprisingly light weight, it has strong build quality and it look good to be honest.",0
"(Works well.): So far so good, it works well.",0
"(Excellent!): This laptop has an amazing speed. I love the bright, sharp screen. Keyboard light is great in the evening and it can be adjusted or turned off (Fn+F7). Overall., excellent buy.",0
The fans are running for no apparent reason. They are tremendously loud and in fact they've been running since I turned on the computer 5 minutes ago.,0
(Laptop review): Great laptop recommend for school work easy to use great futures and light weight,0
"(Great battery life, cheap casing): Considering what I paid, I guess I should feel happier about it.It has great battery life and charges really quickly a well. However, the case has that cheap plastic feel to it. On top of which, any pressure on the surface near the track pad translates to the processor as actual track pad activity, which means that occasionally the Chromebook acts like a possessed machine, jumping screens, opening and closing tabs, etc.Good for what I use it for, but nothing to write home about.",0
"(It’s pretty much ok.): While it’s better than my old laptop, it def tends to struggle a bit with higher processing applications and gets super hot while doing so. It’s a shame. I don’t hate it, but I would have rather saved my money for a better one.",0
(Warranty not current): The computer is lightweight with a good screen. However it does run slowly and the biggest issue is that the one year warranty expired one day after I received it. I would appreciate getting an extended warranty from the seller since this is not what I signed up for!,0
"(Touch and Flip Options , YASSS!): I adore it! Love it! My only complaint is that it has a really hard time picking up wifi and has no option for ethernet. The flip screen and touch option is so fun! I love that I can flip the keyboard the opposite way to watch shows or give classes.",0
"(Typing is great,very nice sounding speakers): No complains",0
(Best PC I've ever had): It's a nice PC. Although I'm not a professional gamer it worked perfectly. Every game I played so far ran smoothly.,0
(Arrived in perfect condition.): Very professional and aesthetically pleasing design! Backlit Keyboard is one of the best I've seen. Easy to start up and Go.,0
(Great deal !): Nice laptop for the price,0
(Fast!): I’ve been wanting to switch from my pc. Everything else I own is Apple. When the prime day price popped up I couldn’t resist. It is definitely a learning curve but fairly easy to get used to. As far as I can see I don’t need to add any programs. I was able to migrate everything from my PC and this baby is FAST!,0
(Four Stars): My Grandson needed the Cromebook 3 for school. HE LIKES IT,0
"(Lo esperado): Era lo que esperaba, bastante satisfecho la verdad por el precio",0
MSI's customer support is a joke too. I submitted several tickets with little to no effect.,0
(My daughter loves it): Quality always with hp,0
"(Comfy but makes noise): Comfortable to work on and love having the # keys attached. However, not fond of the sound when processing and is a slower than I would like on load time.",0
(Moves Slow (NO Space)): The laptop worked great in the beginning and now it’s starting to act slow.Not really a lot of storage but I should have looked up information about the laptop before purchasing.,0
(Music): I bought this exclusivley for working on music and it excells at that,0
"(Excellent budget 2-in-1 l'adoption): Excellent all round, great look, excellent and spacious screen. Find the latest Intel chipset.I highly recommend it.",0
"the voice options nice as users can select speed, intonation and other features",0
"(Terrible keyboard and battery life): Bought these so my wife and I could controller game at a console friends house, work great for that, but for typing or anything battery related strongly recommend something else. No touch screen no 4k screen (great for gaming with these specs but something to note). Good specs and performance but like I said, the keyboard is absolutely terrible on both of them.",0
"(good computer for the price): I used an Asus for 9 years so this was an upgrade but not a huge change. It is much faster than my old computer. The keyboard keys have a nice feel when typing. The letters are not real easy to see, but were not much different on my old computer. Learning Touch Typing is still important to learn. The screen is bright, and I really like the color.",0
"(Great computer!): This review is for Acer Swift 3 SF314-54-56L8, 14"" Full HD, 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8250U, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, Windows 10, Silver.This is my 3rd Acer Swift 3. It is even better than the previous! Beautiful design with much thinner bezel. It's super fast, with lots of features, such as back lit keyboard and fingerprint scanner. It's all metal and yet very light (around 3 lbs). It also charges fast and the battery lasts for hours. Has HDMI, USB-C, 1 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0, memory card reader, Bluetooth, 802.11ac wireless, full HD, stereo speakers, webcam, and headphone jack. The speakers are at the bottom, so if using it over a pillow or lap it could muffle the sound. It has one headset jack, like those on most smartphones. You can use it with regular headphones or with headphones with in-line microphone. Laptop also has microphone. It doesn't get hot, not even after hours of use. Has more than enough storage for me. Other than the speakers being at the bottom, I love everything about this computer.",0
"(Nice for the price.): I've been pretty happy so far. Good security because it's chromebook. No problems. Screen could be better, keyboard is not illuminated.",0
"(Perfect laptop for the games! But i'm got unlucky.): This laptop is a beast , the design and size is perfect for me! The thermals are also good, and i was expected it to be more noisy. After i received this laptop , i enjoyed it so mutch ,the screen (240hz) and performance (rtx3080 16gb) is awesome , but unfortunatelly after a few gaming sessions the screen start to show me artifacts, so i returning it back.",0
(Great product): My husband wanted this to use for online gaming because he is bed bound. He is very happy with this purchase. He is able to play World of Warcraft on it with no problem.,0
(Had the correct ports needed): Laptop works great,0
"(Excelente Tablet Laptop): Excelente calidad precio. Estuve buscando varias opciones de 13"" tipo tablet y estaba entre este y la huawei. Aunque la huawei era más barata solo tenia un puerto y el procesador era de 11th. Esta opcion de asus es la mejor. tiene varios puertos y es de 12th. y aparte trae tarjeta gráfica rtx 3050. Para llevar es ligera y potente así que es perfecta para el trabajo fuera de casa sabiendo que no sacrificadas rendimiento con potabilidad. Tengo una surface go 2 de 8ram y 128gb qué es buena pero solo para trabajos ligeros. En el dise?o de instalaciones para revit ya no levanta. La asus sin duda tiene todo el rendimiento qué requiero. Feliz de la compra. Llevo en excelentes condiciones en el empaque. El teclado es en inglés pero no tengo problema con usar todo el entorno en inglés. Muy rápida",0
"(Surprised): I am surprised at how easy it was to set up this laptop and use windows 11. I am also amazed at how fast this unit starts and stops. Very fast. Great screen and backlit keyboard. Update; After using this unit longer, I fired up my old one to compare and WOW. This HP is like a rocket compared to a bicycle during every process",0
"(Excelent performance and quality.): I've thrown alot at it in terms of games: Cyberpunk, Red Dead Redemption 2, Halo Infinite, Metro Exodus, The witcher 3, Monster hunter world... and alot more, everything on ultra settings with ray tracing in the games that alow it, and its smooth as butter ALL of the time. Great heat control, my unit never goes above 75 degrees in high loads (I do have a thermaltake massive cooling pad, and use my laptop in a very cold environment). Haven't seen one game so far that this computer can't run smoothly. 10/10 Machine.",0
"(False Advertisement): I bought this laptop for my own personal use as a portable workstation when I need to work remotely for work. I have other laptops, but I believed that this would be a suitable replacement for two aging laptops with poor battery life.Problems I have with the laptop:The laptop you get has a 1.x ghz processor versus a 2.5 ghz processor as advertised.You DO NOT get 1-year of Office 365 at no charge with this laptop, just a one month trial.It does a terrible job of running Windows 10.After nearly a month of usage I have regulated this to a Linux workstation. I am currently running Xubuntu 18.10 on the device and it performs quite well given the actual specs of the hardware. Photos and documents load quickly and moderate web browsing is quite possible. The downside of running Linux over Windows is that you lose access to video streaming sites like WWE Network or Spectrum. It would have been nice to watch the football games over the weekend on my laptop.At this stage I am seriously considering a do-over on this purchase and getting a full refund.",0
"(La mejor laptop que he tenido en mi vida.): Excelente inversión, una maquina formidable, es muy rápida, la recomiendo encarecidamente.",0
(Great price): Little heavy might get smaller lighter next tome,0
"(Powerful lap top): Great lap top, very well built, tough as nails. Solid processor, decent display, handles most games well at 1080 60fps. Battery life is only ok but it's what you would expect from the power that it packs so it's relative. Definetly worth the money.",0
"(Great but not perfect.): Great laptop. Great lightweight computer for commuting. Works as advertised. Excellent battery life ( I can get 10 hours with battery saver on sometimes). My only complaint is that the trackpad is kind of crappy. You get used to it after awhile, but it can be a little wonky. Everything else works great.",0
(Screen flicker): Received this laptop - has screen flickering right from the start and it only got worse in a matter of days. Returning it for a refund.,0
"(Super fast and convenient): User friendly right out of the box. It's super fast from start up to shut down. It's my go-to when I don't want to fire up the laptop but want something better than my phone. The battery life is incredible. Since I use Google apps for many things, this is ideal for me. Glad I got it.",0
"(Greatest budget friendly laptop there is): I'm unsure why there's bad reviews, but I wouldn't listen to them. I actually decided on this computer while at Best Buy where I was able to look and touch the computer before purchasing. I've been using Microsoft/HP my ENTIRE life. I was extremely unsure about a chromebook. I went back and forth with myself for weeks. But let me say this, if you're an android lover, this chromebook will come as a second nature. It's based off the Google play store, and some of the features are great! (Like, if you have your phone unlocked nearby, you do not have to input a password to your computer.) Biggest selling points was the screen size. Most of the chromebooks I found are much smaller and this has a HUGE screen with such beautiful quality. The display settings also offer a night light/blue light filter which I absolutely LOVE about it! Battery life is great and just all around great computer. Speed is lightning fast, I actually expected less. I have nothing bad to say about this laptop. If you haven't bought it already, I'm not sure what you're waiting for.",0
"(No Tech can set it up): They hang up on me after saying ""Oh I will call you back"". This as soon as I provide my info, then serial #. There is NO call back every time or I am handed off, handed off and last will say ""A call back"". Nope. They also say ""Oh, this is a Chromebook. As if something is wrong with that. The price paid was low. I am feeling it is not good so attempt to get me to buy another more expensive. Wasted time galor. Shows front page in English, then goes to Arabic, next Chinese-yes I am told to touch continue, then I will hear, Ah, I will call you back. Frustrated, weary",0
(Unreliable): Ordered this about 7 weeks ago. It has stopped working several times. Battery area gets incredibly hot. Fan runs on high. Then the computer just crashes.I called tech support. Still having issues.Called again & they said I will have to return it for repairs. No refund allowed.I definitely would not recommend this product.,0
(Nice small PC): I just wanted a small PC to do some simple tasks that need to be run on a PC only. Fits the bills really well. Can’t imagine it had any horse power to do anything heavy graphics duty wise. But that wasn’t the purpose of buying this laptop.,0
"(WIFI): WIFI constantly drops in and out, all other devices including my old lap top have no problems. it is definitively related to this computer. i have tried all sorts of things to fix with no success.",0
(Good computer for college student): So far this computer has worked out very well for our childs first semester of college. The battery lasts almost all day in school and there are absolutely no complaints about functionality.,0
(Runs super slow within two months of purchasing with nothing downloaded on it): I am really disappointed with this purchase. We have had to switch to an online forum like many businesses so I need more laptops to connect with our students. All we are using this for is the internet and it is extremely slow.,0
(User friendly): Friendly interface. Adequate for my needs. Good battery life. Fast charge.,0
"(Gaming Laptop with quite a bit of bloatware and no touchscreen): As per what I've come to expect with Dell hardware, it comes installed with quite a few things I don't really need, however, it definitely does its job for gaming and is decently comfortable for typing as long as you have a laptop desk to protect your lap or use it on a desk.The orange backlit keyboard is pretty nice for typing (using it to type this review right now) and doesn't feel super mushy like some laptop membrane keyboard, though I'm not yet sure if that'll hold up to long-term hardcore gaming, so even if you're playing at LAN parties elsewhere, I'd probably bring a dedicated keyboard (and of course a mouse) and that brings me to the peripherals.Basically, this has enough USB ports for a mouse and keyboard and 2 spare ports for other items, or if you happen to use one of the wireless keyboard/mouse combos that use 1 dongle, you'd have 3 available. As well, it does have a standard headphone/mic jack for gaming headset needs along with an ethernet port, and it only has 1 HDMI or you have to use 1 of the USB ports as well for another monitor. I'd say if you're going to use this as your main gaming machine, it would probably be best to invest in a USB dock that can help you solve your port problem, though you'll have to check those specs on them especially since not all of them support high refresh rate gaming, so watch out for that.Another thing that this does well with is sound quality. I won't say it's super amazing, but you won't be disappointed with the experience, though you'll definitely want a headset when you're not at home with this.I will also say that this thing gets HOT. Even when it's only using the onboard graphics this thing can kick out heat so be careful when letting it sleep as sometimes it doesn't completely sleep and can get quite hot, so make sure it's well vented when plugged in so you don't have any hot surprises! The brick also cooks as well at times so be careful of that.Overall, it's a decent gaming laptop, though I'd say it's better as a mobile gaming machine over your main machine, but I'm blessed enough to have a gaming PC that outclasses this laptop but is a royal pain to travel with over this.",0
"(Great gaming laptop for the price range!): Almost two weeks in with my new Lenovo Legion 5 gaming laptop and so far I'm quite happy with it. Only problems for me were some old outdated cables which caused connection issues that I needed to upgrade to with additional purchases on Amazon. Keep in mind folks, all the USB-A ports on this thing are 3.2 Gen1. You may or may not have problems trying to use older 2.0 cables. This laptop replaces an MSI gaming laptop that was a few years old and was beginning to have problems so I looked around Amazon and found this little affordable gem. Very happy that I purchased it. I like the 512gb SSD drive, very fast to launch programs including Adobe Creative Cloud apps. I'll add an additional 1tb SSD drive in the available slot in the near future but for now everything is humming along nicely. I added two external 27"" monitors, one via the HDMI port and the other with one of the USB-C ports. Both USB-C ports are Alt-Mode supported and are capable of transmitting video signals so you can add additional monitors via these two ports. I don't know if either USB-C ports are capable of using docks though. I'll contact Lenovo customer service to find out. For gaming I only have time to play a few AAA games, Star Wars Battlefront I & II (EA), BioShock games and the Age of Empires games (not the new AOE IV though, I uninstalled it after playing a few hours, I find the graphics terribly disappointing, awful for 2021-22). So all in all, very happy with my new Lenovo Legion 5 AMD Ryzen 7, 15"" gaming laptop.",0
(Battery Life is Garbage): In Battery Saver Mode you're looking at 3.5 hrs of life.... Will need to upgrade to 80w battery unless you are planning on keeping this thing plugged in all the time or use in short bursts. Unfortunately the 80w battery seems to be sold out everywhere.,0
"(No DVD/CD rom as advertised): The computer, the speed is great. But I despise windows 10. Also, I have returned it because it advertises a CD/DVD writer, but it not only does not have a writer, but does not come with a DVD or CD player. I have a ton of software that I have to load onto it, that comes with CDs/DVDs so after spending days setting it up with my preferences, I begin to install software only to learn that I don't have a DVD/CD rom. Also, Windows 10 forces you to create an account to log in with. It is annoying.",0
"(Powerful laptop with some minor issues): I purchased this laptop to replace my 2016 Acer swift 3 ultrabook class laptop. I got this laptop because it offers far more performance and upgrade paths than my previously laptop.So far here's what I likeThe boot time is very fast takes a few seconds.The keyboard is great, there is no flex and typing feels great. The keyboard back lighting gets sufficiently bright and allows for 3 brightness toggles.The internals of this laptop allows for a lot of upgrades. I purchased the i5 model and the after opening the laptop I found an empty hard drive bay and an empty ram slot. The screen can also be upgraded if you don't like the TN panel. I plan on upgrading my screen to IPS in a few days since it seems like a fairly easy process.Also this laptop is great for gaming. Since the screen has such a high ppi you can pretty much leave off AA and get 60 fps on high settings on all games. Even demanding games like battlefield 1 run great.Fan noise while gaming isn't too loud and the laptop doesn't feel hot. Having the extra air intakes on the bottom of the laptop helps a lot with thermals.The screen also gets pretty bright. You won't have any annoying screen reflections when using indoors and is even fine for some outdoor usage.Here's what I don't like about this laptopThe track pad definitely has some issues. Out of the box I couldn't use two finger scrolling since it kept getting confused with the pinch to zoom gesture. So I had to disable pinch to zoom entirely. Now it works about most of the time but not 100%. Also sometimes when I'm using the track pad it'll just stop responding to my finger an the mouse cursor will stay in place. This is pretty annoying and happens a lot more than it should. Also to top it off the track pad just feels really plasticity and cheap.The screen is a TN panel so the colors look pretty dull and the vertical viewing angles are horrible. However the viewing angles from the side are almost as good as IPS.Overall I'm pleased with this laptop and would recommend it if you looking for a thin and light gaming laptop. However this laptop isn't perfect out of the box, you gotta be willing to take it apart and upgrade it to get the best experience.",0
I like how light and well built the laptop is,0
(Super slow): much slower then I thought it would be,0
"(Reliable service): Got what I expected, on time. Very satisfied.",0
"(Poor Quality Speakers and Screen): The speakers are nearly useless (I have mine turned to the loudest, and can barely hear movies). On Zoom, the speakers sound mushy as if people are talking with a mouthful of marshmallows. The screen quality is not great- the colors are grayed down and you have to have it tilted just so or the picture looks a little like a shadow-holograph.It is decent as far as speed goes. The Microsoft S program is awful, but it is pretty easy to remove. I am disappointed, but I needed a laptop immediately, since my other fell off a counter and broke. The delivery was excellent- a day earlier than expected.",0
(Great laptop): Good fast laptop. Easy to upgrade the storage if you want.,0
"(Really nice laptop): I wasn't certain of what laptop that I wanted but knew what I needed. I had an ASUS from a store in town before. It was great until it became a paper weight. I wanted to upgrade and figured that more cost meant a better unit. Hope I'm not wrong here. So far the computer has been great, light weight, much more battery life and touch screens are a great addition that my tablet and previous ASUS spoiled me on. Fast start up time and very bright screen. Finger print reader a bit iffy but mostly works well. Overall a great laptop. The spread out payments over 5 months through Amazon was a clincher.",0
(Five Stars): A good buy for the price.,0
"(Great laptop… except when it isn’t.): I’m writing this a year after buying this laptop. Do not buy it, absolutely horrible quality laptop, I should have expected that though because of the price. Laptop battery rarely lasts more than 2 hours even at the lowest possible settings. CPU temp sits at a nice 94c when idle. And for some reason, the ONE audio port doesn’t work. And my favorite part, the battery is dying, after only a year of using it, I need to buy a new battery for $95",0
(light weight): like chrome book,0
"(EXCELENTE CALIDAD): EL EQUIPO SE AJUSTA A LO QUE ESTA EN LA PAGINA, EXCELENTE MAQUINA, MUY BUEN EQUIPO ..",0
(should be able to last a decent amount of years if handled with care.): This is a great laptop... I'm upgrading from a gateway m-series that's had it's end of it's useful life.... This is a major upgrade...i5-8300..the gtx 1050ti... Good stuff is going on for this laptop... I had read a few reviews before purchase and watch few YouTube videos..it stated that it's fans are loud and it gets hot...fans are a bit audible only if you game...Netflix and YouTube this thing is silent... But I'm not much of a gamer...wanted a decent graphics card in the event that I wanted to game for a bit... Plus I stream lots of videos also on Netflix... It's perfect... It's the little brother to the predator Helios... Great but..I'll recommend...no troubles or issue so far...slight heavy...but my other laptop was heavier...so I don't mind...,0
"(Great Chromebook): Excellent quality, great screen, touch sensitivity and the included pen works smoothly.",0
"(Keyboard got crazy): After a month of usage, the keyboard does not respond accurately, it repeats different keys and numbers. The delete key sometimes work sometimes it does not. I tried refreshing and it did not work. I had to send it get checked to see what the problem is. I think is hardware. Bad luck! If you can, pay international warranty coverage.",0
(Great deal): It’s a computer and a great price,0

I love the customizable keyboard with steel engine series.,0
(La computadora se queda congelada no funciona el teclado): La computadora no funciona bien se queda congelada y no funciona el teclado,0
"(Awful support and broken audio): 144hz is nice but in Path of Exile I don't get near that, more like 40-70 fps on med low settings. Classic WoW on med high I don't get near it either, usually 70s. Overall laptop performance is 'passable' for playing most games I've tried so far. It does seem to chug and drop frames here and there but overall ok. Keyboard sucks. Trackpad is really frustrating to use to. I like my old ibm thinkpad track pad a lot more. This one seems to double click a ton and stick. Built in mic is generally not very good. It will work but you really need something else. Webcam is the same grainy webcam you would expect, if it works.My major issue is that this comes with a 3.5 combo jack. If I plug my headphones in they do not work. If I plug them in and restart the pc they work great until you unplug them then you need to restart again. If I try and use a splitter and use a mic + headphones it won't work. Attempted to use headphones + built in mic and also doesn't work. Webcam+ headphones doesn't work either. Asus slow and and clunky support took 30 mins of chat time before I was told to reinstall stuff again. He gave me the support number and after being put on hold several times I was told it needed to be RMA'd. Sadly I'm in Alaska right now and it would be nearly 2 months just in shipping time. I'm basically stuck for the next few months till I go home before I can do anything with it.Will be avoiding asus in the future. Generally had ok products from them but if support is this bad / slow it isn't worth risking it when something goes wrong",0
"the quality is top notch and everything feels very ""Rich"" and like it was made with thought.",0
(happy with it): Whose everything it said in the ad,0
The battery life is more than satisfactory and lasts for several hours doing productivity tasks/Web browsing without video.,0
"(Best Value): I purchased my GL65 Leopard after doing extensive research on other laptops in the price range of $1100-$1500, and I can say this is without a doubt the best bang for your buck. It is immensely powerful with the i7-10750H and RTX2070 combo, no other laptop around this price point offers both. You may choose to upgrade RAM and storage, but every game I have tested on this runs on the highest graphics settings without a worry. The fans aren't any louder than similar gaming laptops, but if you're expecting a quiet rig you will sacrifice performance or be paying a lot more. Overall extremely satisfied with my purchase and will be buying MSI again in the future (Which won't be for a while because this laptop is fairly future proof!)",0
"(Mine died after 9 days of use): 2 stars since it died so fast but not 1 star because when it was working it definitely worked, not 3 stars since it had some drawbacks like the keyboard (for those that care it is all a single color, not per key), the video outputs, the 2.5in drive bay that wasn't and the graphics wattage ""misprint"".The battery on any gaming laptop is already tiny given the power so IDK why they didn't shrink it and give us something extremely useful like a 2.5in drive.So it only has one single solitary video out on the HDMI port, the USB-C is only for data. Very disappointing to me. When it was working it worked great aside from that massive drawback. If you are on the go and want to game this could be it for you.But be aware, if it dies then it dies. I only turned mine off once and it never turned back on again.The keyboard just flashed for half a second and went off again. Called the support line and there was nothing to be done about it but get it replaced with another unit (since it was literally less than 2 weeks old)I decided against as I want dual monitors out, it is staying at home at all times and if it can die so easily I'd rather roll the dice with something else, at the very least I am glad it died this early and not one day after the warranty.Long story short, if you get one that works it seems to be excellent at the mobile aspect of a gaming laptop but falls short for a ""Mobile Workstation"" so choose wisely.",0
(GREAT BUY): Brought this for my Wife.... she hook it up and started using it moments after opening the box. The laptop is fast and able to show videos without lag-time. Its fast and easy to use....THE WIFE LOVES IT AND VERY PLEASED!,0
(Great product...I love it): Wow! This is my first chromebook. I've researched all different types and brands of chromebooks and I finally decided upon this one. I love the fact that it's 32G. It's very portable....and boots up really quickly. Using the chrome OS is not bad since I've got an android phone. Google sheets is a great alternative for excell. Opening an excell spread was a bit buggy ...but once I converted the file to google sheets it worked fine. Overall I love this chromebook. It's affordable and does what it says it would do.,0

"(Great gaming laptop, but still overheats quite easily): I have had this laptop for about a week now. It works great when running games such as fortnite and league of legends at 120 fps. Screen quality is really good and it truly is a very good gaming laptop for its price. My only big issue about longevity I worry about is the laptop still gets very hot while gaming, and it is brand new. The laptop charger brick also gets VERY hot while gaming so just be aware. I still don’t think that should stop you from buying. However, it does make me wonder if this issue will continue to get worse and worse over time and if the laptop will die on me in a 2-3 years.",0
"(GPU Fan went out just out of warranty): I took my laptop to a repair shop about a week ago and come to find out my laptop was installed with a bad GPU cooling fan. In which the part cost about $170 on a brand new laptop. Needless to say, I will NEVER be buying a product from Predator again so many better deals on computers.",0
Most navigational keys are placed in strange places.,0
"(Perfect for gaming): I’ve had this laptop for almost a year now and it has been everything I was looking for in a laptop specifically for gaming. I’ve been able to play any game i’ve wanted at a reasonable graphic setting for long periods of time without issue including games like Escape from Tarkov, World of Warcraft (retail) and the Total War franchise up to Troy. I’ve turned all of these games’ graphics settings up to ultra and had good performance, although the laptop can get hot so I’d recommend playing at a lower graphic settings especially if it’s a long session. I’ve not really tracked my FPS too much as i’m not too deep into the PC culture of “muh frames” but i’ve never had anything noticeably bad or not acceptable.With that being said, don’t expect much gaming while not connected to the charger. Battery life isn’t great even with greatly reduced performance. I never intended to use the laptop while not charging but it’s worth noting that you’ll probably have to spend more money if you’re looking for performance AND battery life. Although i’ve not tested the battery life while NOT gaming as that is basically all I use it for.Other than that i’ve had zero issues or malfunctions with me probably pushing near 1000 hours of use.",0

(Decent laptop): Decent laptop for the price,0
"(I really needed this!): First of all, this is a big upgrade for me. My previous laptop was a Toshiba C55 with Intel i3 4th Gen proccesor, 8gb DDR3 ram and a 256 SSD. I was ok with that laptop but I felt that I needed an upgrade. Man I made the right decision!This laptop has everything I've wanted in a computer, except the graphics card of course. All in all, I'm really happy with the purchase.Pros:1. This laptop is thin and light. I can definitely take this laptop anywhere without noticing that I really have it with me.2. I've seen some comments that the sound is bad. Well guess what, It's not bad at all. Not the quality of a Mackbook pro, but come on, for the price? It actually sounds pretty good. Those two speakers in the bottom, when hitting against the table, it bounces off giving a really good base sound, allthough they have the potential to get a bit louder, but that aside, it's great for a laptop this thin.3. Others say that the screen is horrible. I don't see anything horrible about it. It's not full IPS quality, but the 1080p screen looks pretty good. Again, taking you back to the price, can't beat it.4. The backlit keyboard is beautiful! Even though the keyboard needs a bit more work (make it feel more clicky), the white backlit makes this laptop look like a pro when putting it side by side with other well known brands out there.5. There's enough peripherals for what I need. Comes with 2 USB's on the left side, 1 USB-A on the right side, HDMI, USB-C and the sd card slot. Not bad for the size of this laptop. Enough for a thin laptop. Unfortunately it didn't come with an ethernet port, which I use a lot for a more stable connection, but that's what external usb network arapters are for.6. Extra slot for another 2.5 HDD/SSD. Not many laptops at this price range have that, so I'm really glad this one does in case I want to expand my storage a bit more.7. The battery life is just great. The first time I fully charged it, I used it for about 5 hours and it still had some juice left. I think I could have used it up to 6 hours for me to charge it back again. I used it with minimum backlit brightness and about half screen brightness. Not bad at all. Oh, and the charging time, amazing, from 10% to 100% in about an hour, could have been lessCons:1. The flex cable adapter for the additional internal HDD/SDD is not included in the box. I believe this should be included all the time for all of the laptops that offer the chance to expand the storage. Not much of a biggie though, you can find that adapter in amazon for about 12 bucks.2. Cannot upgrade the ram further than 16gb + the integrated 4gb that's soldered into the motherboard. This is unfortunate since it would have been a great oportunity to add some options to update the RAM to 32gb.As you can see, there are way more pros than cons, so you can definitely tell that I really like this laptop. Give it a try, I totally recommend it.",0
"(Light and Fast): My husband and I are not very tech savy people, but we really like our ZenBook. It is very lightweight and very fast.",0
(Super bien): La pantalla super bienY la batería para la potencia de la laptop aguanta bien aparte que la laptop mismo cuida de la misma al optimizar la carga,0
(Very good laptop at a very good price.): I bought the GL65 leopard and I love it. Works awesome and is super fast. screen quality is awesome and games run smoothly. Laptop feels resilient and of high quality. The only thing I would say is a bit of a downside is the battery life. If you are going to play a big title game then you'll get maybe 3 hours tops on a full charge. I myself use always use it with the charger nearby so that's not really a problem for me. The fan can get a little loud when playing big games but I wouldn't say its bad. All in all for the price and the quality you get this is a good buy and I gave no regrets.,0
"(A powerhouse for a steal): My particular job requires the use of many VMs running all at once, so I was really keen on getting a laptop with an i9 processor. Looking in that market, anything with an i9 is easily $2K and onward. I picked this laptop up on the recent Amazon Black Friday deal for $1,649.99 which was an absolute steal! I'm a big fan of the sleek black thin look (which is not common among some of the other gaming laptops like Alienware) along with the option to disable the extra lighting (it looks great with it on). It's just a personal preference of mine to not have my laptop look like a Christmas tree in a professional work environment. I just threw MW2 on here and it runs maxed out with a solid 60 fps throughout. This truly is an all-in-one package for me in terms of work and play. I went out of my way to upgrade my ram to 64 GB for the purposes of running multiple VMs and it runs fantastically. My only caveat (but this is common now-a-days with these manufactured laptops) is the little amounts of bloatware that was present in the operating system; but that was a quick uninstall. All in all, fantastic product with a great build, I am really glad I pulled the trigger on this purchase.",0

(Perfect for novice computer users/choosers.): I wish the battery lasted longer. Other than that I would suggest using a cooling pad with this laptop. I’m enjoying it so far!!,0
"(Bought Used from Amazon Warehouse): It's a beautiful laptop despite a few scratches and small dents. I was willingly to look past the cosmetic blemishes as long as it works. However, it glitches and when I try to restart it, it doesn't restart right away. I can tell it would be worth the price if it wasn't defective. I did buy it used from Amazon Warehouse. But this is not my first purchase from the warehouse so I did expect to receive it with a scratch or two. But the glitching is a bit of a dealbreaker. 2 stars for the pretty titanium cover. Will be returning. Afraid to repurchase with same end result. 😞",0
(EVERYTHING IS FINE): LOVE THIS PRODUCT VERY MUCH.,0
If hulu was streaming and I opened photoshop the computer speakers would spaz and it would freeze and have to be shut down or would restart itself.,0
"(Almost perfect for a non-gamer; microphone adequate for Dragon): I use this laptop to browse the web, use Microsoft applications and access my office computer through Citrix. The screen feels huge compared to my old ultraportable, which had a 13"" screen. This one has a 17"" but feels even lighter! I can easily use one hand to move it off my lap to another surface. The keyboard is a little flatter than I'm used to, and there is more real estate devoted to the track pad than I think is necessary, so I feel like I am reaching over it to get to the keyboard. I also wish there were full-sized PgUp/Dn and Home/End keys, instead of these half-sized ones that I need to use with the Function key. Those minor complaints aside, I am blown away. Unlike my old Lenovo, this computer starts up quickly, connects to the internet quickly, seems to work great, and again, has that huge screen despite being very lightweight. It actually fits in the case I bought for my old 13"" laptop (although barely); because the bevel around the screen is so slim, it's not as much bigger/wider as you'd think for the much larger screen. It and my slim case fit in the rolling bag that I travel with, which is a smaller one designed to fit under most seats and avoid the dreaded ""you have to check that"" instruction from the flight attendants. Because gamers are a big part of the market for high end laptops these days, reviews focus on the lack of a GPU. I haven't noticed an issue for any of my uses. Also, I haven't used it on battery power often, but when I did I found that the battery seemed to last quite a bit longer than previous laptops. I can't say whether the reported time is accurate, but it definitely seems to have a long-lasting battery.Update: the half-sized PgUp/Dn keys drive me nuts. But the fingerprint reader makes logging on fast and easy. Also, I've started using the built-in microphone with Dragon NaturallySpeaking (both locally and through Citrix) and the built-in microphone is surprisingly good. Not as good as a top-rated microphone, but accurate enough that it doesn't feel worth setting up or attaching an external microphone or headset. Using the built-in microphone is so convenient when I'm not at my desk!",0
"(Great laptop): I've used my new laptop for over 2 months and have had no problems at all. It's fast, light, excellent screen, and even the sound is very good for a laptop. The wireless internet connections have also been excellent. I didn't want a large laptop since I need it on my long trips, and this one really fits the bill. I would highly recommend.",0
(Good laptop): Great system... I just wish it had more storage.,0
"(So much better than a TV box.): I bought this to connect to my TV after having tried three Android boxes, which were all hopeless, and an HP Stream with Windows 10 which didn't even have enough memory to update itself. I finally got it right. This Chromebook (with an added wireless keyboard) is simple to use, incredibly quick and understands how to be hooked up to a TV without turning itself off all the time. Well worth the money.",0
"(pretty good computer!): This is a pretty good laptop! it's lightweight, has a good display, good graphics card. It plays games like the witcher beautifully, but I've had some trouble with other games that are a bit more graphically demanding but for casual gaming it's great. It does get very hot if you're making it work hard (i.e playing a video game or rendering anything). My only two complaints are that the keyboard only has two settings for the backlighting (on or off), and the screen is still very bright even on its darkest setting, which doesnt sound like too much of a problem except I do like watching movies at night with the lights off to not disturb my roommates. But overall would recommend buying.",0

"(Best priced budget gaming laptop on the market): Laptop was packaged very nice, little bloatware, few updates to do right off the bat. Some Amazonians received a ""Chinese only"" Windows version, I did not.Out of the package the laptop looks great. Not super flashy, overall its aesthetically pleasing. When you open the lid you are met with a well designed Steelseries Keyboard. The laptop has a large palm rest area, almost too big imo, they could have spaced out the keyboard a bit better. I dont use laptop touchpads, but this one is one I would consider keeping my mouse unplugged for while web surfing and youtubing.Performance for the price is tough to beat. Beefy i7, little skimpy on the RAM only 8GB DDR4, easily upgradeable. Has the nVidia GTX 1050Ti 4GB GDDR5, the screen looks great no bleeding or anything, most laptops in this price range have just the 1050 or even lower specd GPUs. Also has 2 drives, a 128GB m.2 SSD which houses the Windows 10 OS, very speedy, I would buy a larger 2.5"" SSD to replace the slow 1TB.I havent pushed this laptop yet, and I dont really plan on it, I have seen other users on youtube get the CPU up to 91C, so it may get too hot for your lap.Battery life is going to be atrocious, and I fully accept that, I plan to stay plugged.I am very pleased with my purchase of this laptop, for the price and specs, I dont think you can pass on it.",0
"(Solid purchase): I decided to buy myself a gaming laptop and for the price, this one can not be beaten. The price is reasonable while being a very sturdy machine. Most games run on ultra or high setting. The only downside was the storage space but for an extra 70 bucks, you can expand it so not an issue at all.",0

You can't turn it on and it isn't enabled by default. So any RAM you buy could end up running at a much slower speed than advertised. My 3200 RAM with tight timings ended up with 2666 loose timings due to no XMP. If they had included XMP, this laptop would be perfect within its' current price range ($1600).",0

"(Don't be fooled by the features they're advertising.): The bad reviews that you see on this labtop are true, don't be fooled like I was thinking I was going to get what they were advertising about the features of the labtop, especially the processor but I was wrong. I didn't like the fact that I couldn't use any video editing software for my videos specifically Davinci Resolve 16. And everytime I tried to use Davinci Resolve 16 my screen would get frozen and show a blue error screen because the processor for this computer is only 1.80GHz to 1.99GHz. They advertised it as having 4.60GHz and that was a lie. After trying to figure out what was going on with my computer, I checked the properties of the labtop and it showed the processor as being 1.80GHz to 1.99GHz. I then checked to see the labtop I had ordered off of Amazon and then I look at the properties of the labtop and it said that it had a processor of 4.60GHz and that was incorrect. I then looked to see if they had any bad reviews and holy behold, the same thing I'm telling you is the same thing they were trying to tell me. So if you wanna edit videos and do stuff like that, then you shouldn't buy this labtop from this vendor because they're lying about the labtop properties. At the time when I bought the labtop it cost me $1,274.84, I should've known that a good labtop couldn't do what I wanted at that price but I bought because I thought was getting a good deal on the labtop.",0
"(NICE!): This came as a free item along with the Samsung S9 I bought. I actually love it. It does everything you need a small laptop for.

Also, the keyboard skips a beat every so often. This has occurred with th ""?"" Mark key a couple of times. Will see if it continues.

I have yet to download Android Studio IDE and take it for a spin, but I don't foresee any problems. If I experience any lag that's noteworthy, I'll update my post. SO far I am pretty happy about this purchase. Applications open up quickly, the battery life is great, the casing is durable, the device is lightweight, and I dig the fingerprint ID system for quick access. If you are just an average user who does simple tasks such as: email, YouTube, streaming vids or music, etc... this device is more than enough for you. If you are looking for a device to do heavy gaming... well... I doubt you are reading this review. For me, it's easy to rate this 5 stars. The only thing I'd say might be an issue for others (not me but for others) is the webcam. It's not the highest of quality, but who gives a rat's ***. I don't think they can get a high quality cam in such a thin case, so whatevs. Hope this helps.",0

(For the price we are very happy with it): Bought this for my high school age daughter to do home work. For the price we are very happy with it.,0
"(Great Laptop, Windows 10, Inexpensive & Powerful): I have had a Google Chromebook & MacBook Pro as well as a Dell Desktop and I have to say that the Asus 11.6 is definitely a favorite! I onlyhave two recommendations, adding a micro SD card(I used a 128GB, roughly $22, works great) and if you plan on downloading apps that are NOT from the Microsoft store then take the laptop out of S Mode, you will see what I mean! But besides that, The design is slim and sleek, fits perfect inside of a bookbag. The battery life is amazing, screen and sound quality is very clear and clean as well! Full Windows 10, I use FL Studio, Photo Shop and Audacity completely fine with NO lag! I have also beenable to download a game or too such as Asphalt 8 and play without lag as well! Great purchase, definetly a steal for $150.",0
arrived with a dent in one speaker and bad backlight bleed in one spot at the bottom of the screen.,0
"(I'm so happy right now): I'm so pleasantly surprised. This pavilion doesn't even remotely seem used. It looks and performs as if its brand new. I am SO happy with my purchase and glad I went for it. I have an HP from 2015, i3 processor, and it's starting to show it's age. I love HP and this doesn't disappoint. The swivel touch screen is sleek, thin, and easy to use. It's extremely fast. 10 out of 10 would buy from this seller again. :)",0
"(Good Gaming Machine, Excellent Build Quality): 3/19/2022 Update: This laptop can get very loud even when you're not doing anything intensive. I never really noticed it before but I think after upgrading it to Windows 11, the fan runs louder more regularly.2/1/2021 Update: This laptop is easily upgradeable, which is a huge plus. I swapped out the NVME M.2 SSD with a 1TB. This model, the AN515-54, has two M.2 slots plus a spot for a 2.5"" SSD drive. So in theory you can have three storage drives installed. Both M.2 slots accept NVME but only one can read SATA. I also add an additional 8GB RAM to make the total 16GB. It was really easy to do and even if you're not with computers, you can easily figure it out by watching a tutorial on YouTube.Original Review: I had very low expectations for this laptop and I was actually pleasantly surprised by how great the build quality of the laptop was. I forgot how great Acer laptops are. This laptop is no desktop replacement but it's definitely good enough to play most games. I ran 3DMark on it and it scored 3548, which is decent for the price of the computer. WIth that score, you will be able to play most games although not at its highest settings. Overall I recommend it and I'll be using this for years to come.Pros:- Great value and the build quality is excellent. I especially love the keyboard and how the laptop lid opens and closes. It just feels really nice.- The keyboard is excellent. Great travel and it's full-sized.Cons:- Comes with a bunch of bloatware to include Norton, Dropbox, Firefox (I actually prefer it but it does come preinstalled), Spotify, Netflix, ExpressVPN, and probably a bunch more that I'm missing.- It's hard to insert the power cable into the computer for some reason. Not really hard but definitely harder than it needs to be. Maybe I just haven't figured out how to do it properly.- I got around 4-5 hours of battery life. Not bad but much less than the advertised 8 hours.- The fan can get very loud.",0
"(Great product!!): Most that I expected, a great laptop for a great price!!!",0
(Great laptop): I will keep it short. We use this laptop for general office work as well as editing video on location. It has been handling both tasks really well. No problems at all. My only complaint is how easily fingerprints show all over the thing but I don't really care about that very much. Would recommend for sure.,0
(Restart by it self): Everytime my son is about to do some work on online its restart by it self. I got this for school. My son can never submit his classwork in. I very Disappointed in this chromebook. We can never do anything.,0
"(funtion): So i bought this item in October of 2018 for my 13 year old daughter who""s birthday is on the 25th December ... she was excited and enjoying the use of this product. Then exactly 3months later it stop working , it is not powering up and i'm so upset wondering if i spent my monies in vein....any way i ordered a new charger for it and i'm awaiting its delivery to see if the problem is the charger why it wont power up.",0
(Wow): This computer is great,0
(Works as expected): Nice little laptop.... sure its old but it's new to me and it's 10x's faster than my old laptop at half the price of a new one... so it's a win win,0
(Incredibly fast M1 chip.): Exceeded all expectations. Amazing entry level Mac.,0
"(Does not disappoint): So glad I went with Acer again. Everything I loved about my Nitro 5 has been made even better, including better build quality, plus much better cooling ability. It's perfect ?",0
Removable keycaps for customizing,1
(Touchscreen failed after 7 months): PROS:Great Value/price ratioI have enjoyed used it and performance is great- fast and seamless use of windows.CONS:Touchscreen stopped working suddenly after 7 monthsLenovo service took 1 month to service the computer- terrible auto service web siteUpdate: Even though Lenovo replaced the screen- it failed again after 2 months- now out of warranty and using as a laptop without the touchscreen- frustrating. Not buying Lenovo again.The power connection and headphone connections are next to each other. Way too easy to connect your headphones to the power connectorOn/Off bottom on the side- when handling the computer easy to turn it off inadvertentlyToo much fan noise- can get hot (unlike Yoga 710),0
(Touch screen ? Great laptop Bad Camera Quality): Like any laptop this laptop has its little quirks but overall this is one of the best laptops to purchase. I don't know if this is touchscreen but its not that big of a deal for a person like me . The picture/ video quality is great to look at and is very clear but the Photo Booth camera kinda sucks which is a little disappointing . Other than these little things the laptop is pretty fast and has all the essential app to create .,0
"(Best macbook ever): Ignore the bad review , that guy doesn’t have a clue , , I love it and I’m using it a lot and I recommend you to get the MacBook Air m2, has an amazing screen and its really fast",0
"(dead after 2 years): for some odd reason it just stopped working.chromebook powers up, no display even on an external monitor.i got cheaper laptops that are still running after 4yrs. then there's also the lack of documentation for troubleshooting.lesson learned, these devices are not meant to last.",0
(Great product): Gift for my college grandaughter,0
(works very well ...): The product arrive as promes in good conditions and have no regrets........... very happy,0
"It feels loose and hollow, therefore it is very noisy, even with the slightest touch",0
"(A Big Screen, But Light as a Feather): This is a very nice laptop with an incredible 17-inch screen. While it doesn't have a touch screen, I don't miss it much having spent most of my career working on Macs. The keyboard is a little off-centered, but all in all, I really like this laptop a lot. Besides the screen, the most outstanding feature is that it's unbelievably light! I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend the LG Gram 17-inch to others looking for a large-screened laptop without having to sacrifice portability.",0
"(No les recomiendo comprar computadoras de USA): Cuando me llegó llegó sin pila, (se me hizo raro) posteriormente la puse a cargar, la prendí (tardo mucho en prender) hice la configuración y empecé a utilizarla la pantalla se veía opaca, y los botones fallaban cuando la quería apagar no se apagaba se volvía a aprender hasta que después de 6 veces logré apagarla, la volví a prender y me salió pantalla azul... La regrese.",0
"(Great laptop): Great laptop, works well as a college student.",0
"(Not Worth It): Bad screen resolution, charger and laptop stopped working after a couple days of use, cant play 1080p videos. They play it up to be something that you can take on the go and it works just as well as any other laptop it doesnt.This is a Chromebook not a laptop and theres a fundamental difference between them being that Chromebooks are worthless. They’re slow and not user friendly. Need something small and on the go buy an actually laptop thats small or a freaking tablet.",0
(Not happy!): Speed of computer is very slow. We have an 11 inch chromebook that runs twice as fast. We have 400mg internet. So not the problem. We bought two and both my husband and son went back to there 11 inch. Very disappointed!!!!,0
"(This piece of crap breaks after one year): Do not buy this. It's wonky and crappy and lasts only a year. Screen is tiny, it works slow. Basically it sucks and don't waste your money.",0
"(Zippy machine, great value): I'm happy with this laptop so far. Got the i7 version and it's very zippy. The feel and look isn't as premium as some other laptops I've had, but the performance for the price is a great value.",0
"(Reliable fast inexpensive, perfect for work.): Sales",0
"(Is it a phone? A computer? Doesn't know.): This computer doesn't know if it's a phone or a computer. Very difficult to use. Everytime I try to do something, like a spreadsheet for my home business, the only place you can save, if you are using Chrome OS, is in the Google 1 cloud-- not on the local computer. Gives me worries about stolen figures and personal data.",0
(Broken): Laptop was broken,0
the fans take off like a jet and I get stuck on a black screen,0
"(Processor speed is not 3.4GHz, it's 1.6, other than that it's an ok laptop for the price): Processor is 1.6 not 3.4. I'm still trying to figure out how to overclock it but I've never done that before and I have yet to find a way to do it that makes enough sense to me to be able to... This is my first laptop, and I built my desktop. That being said, I don't know the first thing about upgrading laptops. I'm just out of the return period or I would just swap it for something more powerful. Maybe the tools to overclock should have been included if he description is going to suggest it's faster then it is? I guess the review, from this point, depends on how easily (if I am able to) get the processor above the 1.6 GHz.The million dollar question then is: How do I get the processor to overclock to the ""up to 3.40GHz"" per the description of the laptop?",0
"(Mine was defective...not confident enough to try another...): Almost every time I move the screen half with relation to the keyboard half, the Chromebook screen flickers and then it shuts down. Had to send it back for a refund. Otherwise, unit seemed pretty nice except for horrible owner's manual. Don't really know about battery life since I couldn't run it for long.",0
(nice): Pretty good,0
(Great Laptop): I bought this used through Amazon. It came in like-new condition. My daughter uses it to play Minecraft and Star Stables. We've had it for a month or so and are very pleased with it. I highly recommend it and buy it again if I had the need.,0
"(An actual gaming laptop.): Run all games smooth butter, fans a bit loud but I think is necessary for the GPU card. I liked the bottom design, seems to have great cooling system. Speakers are bad, but once you add Nahemic drivers it gets better. Screen is awesome at 144hz. So far, very satisfied that it works for gaming. I tried others with RTX 1660 Ti and just couldn't run playable games, by far this is the best value you can get.",0
"(It does the job): This was a gift for a young student in the area, to help with her distance learning, and she is very happy with the device.",0
(excelente compra): mas de lo que esperaba,0
Screen resolution is great for gaming with no lag.,0
"(So far so good and very satisfied): I am overall very satisfied with my 2020 Apple MacBook Air purchase. Every works smooth and no problems so far. Powerful laptop. For now, I highly recommend.",0
(Pretty good buy so far): Havent had this chromebook very long. Easy set up and my daughter seems happy with it. Compared to her old one it seems kind of cheaply made but time will tell. Happy so far.,0
(Disappointed): After having an ASUS Zenbook really disappointed by Dell. Quality Control is a problem. Buying a new labtop after less than a year.,0
BIOS has a setting to disable the annoying ROG brand POST graphic sound.,0
(Great computer for the price): Like it very well,0
"(Wrong machine, no honoring warranty): Started crashing every 4 hours initially so I thought it was nothing, maybe something in registry or something. Then out of the blue it starts crashing every 5 minutes that fall, Lenovo wouldn't honor warranty claiming it's because of corrupt hard drive, between them and MS I reset it 5 times. After I threatened to sue they finally agreed to fix hardware, but i didn't trust them anymore and didn't want their pos. I took it apart and it even had wrong hardware inside, ie 2tb hdd instead of 512 ssd, but somehow right specs showed on system screen. it was also not mounted no screws at all. I gave up and counted on Amazon who said they'd give me 200 less than I paid for restocking even though it was fraud to sell me the wrong machine. When I finally got refund they gave me 400 total less. I don't trust any online retailers much anymore, stay away from Lenovo though.",0
(Chrome book): Nice lol chrome book for the low! Couldn’t pass this up. I got 3 as Christmas gifts. They LOVED them.,0
the backlighting switched from my preset to just plain white background,0
"(A few clarifications on specs.): OK just a few notes. The computer runs well but a few side notes:Although the GTX 1050 TI is now listed as being the minimum recommended for VR, it is NOT VR ready. A test by Occulus Rift program shows it to not meet the minimum requirements.The computer uses a dual display driver system. This means that not all games will utilize the Nvidia GTX 1050 TI card. It may utilize the Intel 630 and run Nvidia for the Physics only. (though I bench-marked this system with both Valley and Furmark, the individual game will ultimately decide which card will run when playing. You can select the Physics to run Nvidia under global or application. I.E. Fallout 4 will default to the on-board Intel 630 GFX processor. This doesn't mean that it does not run well it does, you are simply not getting all the optimization from the GTX 1050 TI Card.)Furthermore the Nvidia Ge-force Experience program will not run with this system currently. I am looking into this further with Nvidia. Apparently in its 2d running state the program cannot detect the 1050 TI and therefore will not optimize anything.For the prices this is a very good mid-range",0
"(THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK): Sleek design, I wanted a gaming laptop that wasn't big and bulky... THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK... Plus it is 200$ off right now... Screen is nice sized, necromancer is excellent!!! CAN I SAY MORE?!? Has the college design with the guts for GLORY....",0
"It comes with a backlit keyboard, a great convenience when the surrounding light is not the best.",0
(Excellent perfomance): I was a little scared but its a good computer for working. The light a vack can be shut down with fn+L and the webcam doesnt annoy that much.,0
"(Battery DOA, the laptop wouldn't turn on, and ...): Battery DOA, the laptop wouldn't turn on, and when plugged in to a power adapter, didn't recognize the existence of a battery, the windows battery indicator said 0% available, plugged, in not charging!! Brand new, out of box laptop. Ordered a replacement, will see how that fares. Be warned.",0
(It's good): Good computer had alot of issues with the wifi but I fixed it through trial and error. The speakers are ass but it's a good computer overall.,0
(My son was very happy with my Christmas gift to my granddaughter!): Great for my granddaughter!! She loved it!!!!,0
The box packaging etc is nice and thick.,0
"(Great value for the money): I purchased this laptop and have been using it for about 6 months. It has been fantastic. The only gaming I really do is World of Warcraft and with all the video settings on high, it easily churns out high fps rates and makes for a great experience. I really like the keyboard; it has a nice feel and the backlit keys are easy to see in all lighting conditions. I have always been a Dell person, but no more. Great job Acer!",0
"Lightweight, bright, excellent graphics.",0
(Love it): Love the laptop,0
(Worthless): Received the computer as promised. But was inoperable. Battery dead and no charger included with the purchase. Complete rip off,0
Only nuisance is that the right shift key is placed outside of the arrow keys.,0
"(great laptop): After a lot of research of other laptops, this one seemed to fit my needs which were basically light weight, fast, adequate memory and the right size for me. This fits the bill. I use it for accessing my other laptop by remote server so that I can work wherever a connection is available and also searching on this one for genealogy purposes. Delivery was as promised and I am happy with it. Would recommend it.",0
"(you get what you pay for.): I have to be honest, I was very let down by the initial mis-labeling of these chromebooks. I bought two of these as graduation presents for my brother and sister who just graduated high school. I searched and searched for a better deal than the initial one on this chromebook. Having initially said it had a 500Gb hard drive. I seemed to good to be true, and it was, after having received them the description on amazon changed to the original 16Gb drive. I should have known better as chromebook are always this way. it was too much of a hassle to return them, so I gave them to my siblings anyway. They seem to enjoy them, as they primarily seem to only be useful for web surfing. no document storage, no central ""hub"" if you will like on a regular laptop, only chrome and online storage. you get what you pay for I suppose, I was very let down again, I recommend for extra storage a 128Gb micro sd card, or an external hard disk.",0
"(Great little device, excellent battery life, great for school/uni): bought this Chromebook for university. works great, speedy; hardly ever slows down even when multiple tabs open and streaming video.very portable and excellent build quality.the pen works great, with very little input delay when writing. (m3 version)When not using the pen, tablet mode can be a little unresponsive, I wouldn't suggest buying this device to replace an iPad or tablet.the screen is bright and colourfull.overall great little laptop, perfect for studying or secondary device. chrome os is excellent and speedy.(this model has no backlit keyboard)",0
"(Product and Support Issues): I purchased this laptop on Amazon about 6 months ago. Everything seemed to be working fine until the other day. I opened the computer up and it never got past the logo screen. I went through all the built in diagnostics, none worked. Tried to do a recovery, that failed. Contacted HP tech support hoping they would at least be able to identify the problem or tell me to send it back for warranty repair. Tech support put me through the paces to restore, recover, etc. Nothing worked. Finally I was disconnected from the chat with no resolution. I am very disappointed with HP's customer support and how I was left hanging with six months left on my warranty.",0
(Performance): Excellent!,0
"(Freeze ALOT): This laptop is quick and very useful for many tasks, but recently about 3 months in, it starts randomly freezing for 3-4 minutes and it takes time away from the task at hand. I notice it a lot when using youtube from the browser and sometimes it does it for other applications as well. Everything is up to date and the PC is clean. I tried contacting Lenovo Customer Service, but there seems to not have any for this laptop and it's really frustrating.",0
"(Excellent Laptop): I bought this for my 16 year old son, and he Loves it! He says it great for gaming and for doing his school work. He is very happy so far.",0
"I love about this laptop is that the exterior is very muted as opposed to most other ""gaming"" laptops with their red highlights and harsh angles and design.",0
The large trackpad under the keyboard was really unobtrusive and did not impede accurately typing on the keyboard.,0
(2 months later still waiting on refund): Battery did not work on delivery,0
A dual-surface construction with rigid and soft texture for varied typing experiences,1
"(Purchase of Second ASUS Power Adapter at Amazon Is a Mess): I recently purchased this ASUS Zenbook, and the laptop itself is great. Because I use it in two locations and the adapter is very large and bulky, I need to have a second power adapter. Well, I have been astonished at how frustrating it is to buy one. I looked up the part number (A17-150 P1a) and searched for it at Amazon. I placed my order for the JUYOON 150W adapter that Amazon displayed for this part number. When the adapter arrived, I found that its DC Plug was too big for the hole in my laptop!So be careful because ordering the right ASUS part number on Amazon does not mean that you are going to get the right part!! If I had known that ASUS and its suppliers have more than one adapter with the same part number, I would have measured the DC Plug carefully before I placed my order at Amazon.I then decided to remove the uncertainty at Amazon and find the adapter on the ASUS website. This was frustrating because there was no information there on the right power supply for this laptop. And there was no match for the part number at all. The adapters there were listed by wattage and not by part number. I then tried chatting with their support person, and found that she couldn't help me at all. Not her fault, but shows a poor process for post-sales purchases. She told me to call some phone number during normal working hours and speak to someone who knew the information about what ASUS power adapter went with each ASUS laptop.So be warned about ASUS post-sales accessories. It's very tricky!",0
(Great for college): Got this as a Christmas present for my fiancé. She just started college. This is perfect for her!,0
"(Gets the job done): I needed a laptop for work in order to store documents, process receipts and email with clients and work colleagues. I didn't have the budget for a brand new laptop and this HP device really solved the problem without breaking the bank. The hard drive has more than enough space for everything I need to store and the processing speed, while a little slow at times, is sufficient for me to get my work quickly and with little fuss. I haven't bought a refurbished laptop before, but this experience has shown me such products can be valuable and worth the risk",0
(I love him): Very cool notebook,0
"(Love it): Bought this as a second gaming pc for my daughter to play MMORPGs with me. Inexpensive, uncomplicated, and ready to go in an hour. Love it. No problems so far.",0
"(An absolute beast for the price!): I bought this because I'm a freelance writer and I needed a cheap, portable machine for typing and emailing. It does much more than that.It's got great speakers, so it's replaced my desktop as my go-to Netflix machine, and the keyboard has a nice, soft touch. If you're looking for a computer for web browsing, streaming media, email or basic office applications, I'd definitely recommend this device.",0
"(You get what you pay for): You get what you pay for. It functions and does the basic necessities, but is slow and has poor audio quality (very low max volume) and poor web cam quality. Found it not that great for video calls. I default back to using my cellphone because it’s better quality. If this is what you can afford, it will get the basic stuff done.",0
"(Excelente rendimiento): Muy satisfecho con la MacBook Air, muy rápida, cómoda y versátil.",0
(Ideal start): Good beginner laptop,0
"(not bad for a budget gaming laptop): Very fast for average tasks and can play just about any game at the right settings. Fans are loud when under load, and storage is not very large, but upgrading memory is very easy, an extra m.2 and sata slot is nice. I think the sweet spot for this is between 600-700$",0
(Excellent): Incredibly easy to use quick response and light,0
(priceworthy): Product is of good quality.,0
"(It's great, but the space bar squeaks something fierce.): I think the entire computer is exactly what I needed it for, which is primarily running Clip Studio Paint, Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro. It runs all of those programs and more very well! The only issue is that I'm losing my mind over this space bar squeaking. It's constant and grating. Wish it didn't squeak only a couple months into buying, but overall a good product.",0
"(Stops working after a few months *Edit*): Worked great for a few months then got a ""No Bootable Device Found"". When I went into the bios there isn't even a partition order. Will try calling Acer support but buyer beware: make sure you buy a warranty through Amazon to cover your buttEdit: Changed rating from 1 to 5 stars as I was able to use the hardware warranty through Acer without a problem. It was actually funny because their support team over the phone knew exactly what the issue was.Overall amazing laptop and has worked without a hitch ever since sent a new one. Just make sure to get a warranty as i think there is an OEM problem with the chip that they can fix if you send it back",0
"light weight and has most of the connections u need, screen colors are good",0
(Great value): The product was fantastic,0
"(Loaded! Desktop performance in a laptop!): I’m a desktop computer guy. I’ve had a few laptops in the past and have been pretty underwhelmed by them. In general, in my experience, dollar for dollar desktops outperform laptops.I have to say that this HP Envy is a very welcome exception to that rule. The CPU is an Intel Core i7, as good as anything in a desktop. With 12 gigs of RAM it blazes through apps, and has a terabyte of storage. On top of all that, it has an optical drive, a major plus and something that’s becoming ever more rare in laptops. That means that in addition to being able to write to an external medium (for archiving or whatever) you can watch videos, as well as game.Speaking of gaming, it has a pretty impressive graphics card, too. Not enough for a full-blown gaming experience for those games with very high graphics needs, but still pretty impressive.The touch screen is a very large 17 inches. Of course, this makes the entire unit somewhat bigger than what’s becoming the “standard” small size for laptops, but again, it’s a tradeoff. Great visuals versus small size.Set up was very easy, and it was up and running in no time. To this point I haven’t experienced any of the problems mentioned in the other two reviews that are up at this time, nor any others.Loaded with features, very fast and capable, I’m beyond impressed with this laptop. A very solid 5 stars.",0
(Just a great little device): Works perfectly for my needs.,0
"(Best gaming laptop for the money): I purchased this laptop used for $2,000. It came with a generic version of windows (had to install the Gigabyte Control Software), and looked perfectly new. I thoroughly tested it, and performance did not disappoint ?My guess is somebody bought it new, sent it back for a bad SSD, so they just replaced the SSD and sold it as ‘used’.Good seller overall!",0
"(Battery life): The battery life is not lasting, that is my only problem with this laptop.",0
"(Mother board went 1.5 years after purchase.): Very Disappointed! Purchased for my son for school, to be able to support using a CAD program.

"(This machine is a very useful budget laptop): This machine is a very useful budget laptop.The screen quality of the laptop is not great but, I am satisfied with the battery sustain time of this machine.In addition, the design of the laptop is good enough, although the case is made of a plastic materials.",0
"(Applications non fonctionnelles): L'intégration du Play Store entre parfois en conflit avec le Chrome Store, et donc certaines applications sont dupliquées, et non fonctionnelles.",0
(To little for too much): Had this 2 days and already know I will need another laptop soon. it is NOT as advertised and is slower than my 20 year old tower. Over all quite dissatisfying.,0
"(Excellent Laptop): It came like described, although it's fine I will upgrade memory and SSD",0
"(Easy to use): I recently purchased this Acer Aspire laptop when my costly Dell decided to quit. I refused to spend money on another Dell. So I was shopping on Amazon one day and came across this Acer laptop. The reviews were good, and from them, I decided to give this laptop a try. I am SO glad I did! It is everything that the Dell was but at a much lower price. I use it every day and have had NO problems at all. It is lightweight and loads all the apps very fast. Quick charging and is worth every penny.",0
"(Fast delivery, awesome product, no lost data): The first Chromebook, about 18 months old, died. The college student loves the Chromebook. It works perfect for him. The great part was all of his work was in the cloud so he didn't loose anything.Amazon was able to deliver it in one day! He couldn't have bought one locally in that amount of time. Quick delivery was key!",0
(Mine was faulty...hope you have better luck): Didn't even last a month before it broke. I would turn it on and the fans started up like a jet engine. Then a sign said it was too hot and the computer would turn off. All I wanted was to play GW2. Amazon refunded me but I'm making a desktop instead.,0
(Small and fast!): I have always loved Chromebooks but I miss a bigger laptop. This will do for now.,0
"(Great computer!): Came in with no issues. Nice working computer, bright display. Plus has internal space for a 2.5"" disk drive.",0
"(Google Chromebook is an Internet Search Tool): If you want to use this to read email, check social media and watch netflix, then buy it. Other than that, it is literally useless.",0

"(I love ASUS! My last one died from my 3 ...): I love ASUS! My last one died from my 3 year old dumping water all over it, frying the mother board. I decided to get a new one. I love it so far. I have had it for about a week already. This one is just like my other one, but faster.",0
t's alot faster than expected for the price.,0
"(Best laptop I’ve ever had): Absolutely amazing laptop! Runs games with zero lag. I was lucky to get it for $579, and would recommend checking this frequently as it goes super fast at that price.",0
"(This laptop likes to sleep): The laptop is nice looking, but it has a major issue. It constantly turns off and goes into sleep mode. I have looked for every kind of help on this issue, but nothing has worked so far. If I stop working for even a minute, it powers down and goes into sleep mode and then I need to go through the log in process to get back to my work. So I need to write this quickly and I probably need to save up for another laptop. Don't you think that if you spend over a thousand dollars, that a laptop should work for at least for a few weeks? If you want a laptop that will work as hard as you do, don't buy this one. All it wants to do is sleep.",0
"(Quality PC): I've only had this laptop a couple of days, but I really like it. I replaced an Acer and the construction of this unit if far superior. The Acer had only two small hinges for the screen about an inch wide. This HP has a continues hinge almost the entire length of the case. The hinge mounts broke off the Acer causing me to buy a completely new laptop. Just keep this in mind when purchasing a laptop. Ok a little update. I do like this laptop a lot. I read reviews on here giving one star because the product was broken or didn't work right out of the box. I'm dumbfounded by these reviews. The fact that a product is broke when delivered has nothing to do with the product itself. This device had a defective battery out of the box. I didn't notice that until after a few days. I contacted H P and they were great to work with. They had me run some tests and agreed that the battery was no good. H P offered to replace the battery free, but wanted me to return the laptop to them and they would replace the battery. I declined their offer as I had already loaded my personal info onto the laptop. They weren't game to sending me a new battery and let me replace it. Well, being the kind of person I am, I went to my favorite retailer, Amazon, ordered the proper battery, replaced the dead one and now I have a great laptop with a good battery. I would still give it a 5 star review and recommend it to anyone.",0
"(Keep looking!!): What a disappointment. I was so excited to get my new laptop. The screen quality is aweful..graying out if I even shift a bit in my seat. The touch pad was wonky..jerky and not responsive at all, at times. But the real kicker was the volume...or lack thereof. At the highest setting we could barely hear it. So I tried eatbuds. They were even worse. If i held them crammed into my ear I could faintly hear.Just aweful all around. It is boxed and ready to be picked up for return. I have already ordered a replacement...not the same model obviously..fingers crossed!!",0
"(DO NOT BUY): Purchased April 2021, Laptop ran ok for a few months and now is incredibly slow and useless. No returns either.",0
(Great purchase): Packaging was secure and the laptop was new and in mint condition. Performance thus far is excellent. No complaints,0
"(Defect Pixel and Screen): Finally took it out the box after a week of it arriving. The box was slightly mess up. The laptop seem on good condition. After less then a week of usage. The top of the screen started to glitch, today it got even worse. Go to see if my warranty will over it. If not it will be return smh...I wanting to get these laptops for a while and its defected",0
"(Very Nice): Just what I was looking for, Fast , Light and Great Screen !",0
"(I love this Chromebook!!): I just got this Chromebook today. I ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Sunday. I was very surprised at how fast it came. The only problem is that there is no Caps Lock button on the keyboard. Instead of it, there is a search button that takes you to Google and all the other apps you have on the Chromebook. I put a flashdrive into it and I couldn't find a way to eject it but that was pretty easy to figure out. I just got on Youtube and found instructions. Other than that it has been great so far! I am sooooo glad I bought this one!",0
"(Great): Great specs, works really great and really light to carry around.",0
(Junk Battery): Has never held a charge or been able to work without being plugged into the outlet. Now the screen just stays black even when plugged in due to not enough power from the battery =( Would not buy refurbished from this site again.,0
"This laptop is pretty solid, carrying it and the charger around to and from class haven't been much of a problem.",0
(Best gaming laptop for the price): Ive had 0 issues with this computer and it runs almost any game at max settings with 0 performance drop offs,0
(All): No memory,0
"(Worth all $1400 I paid for it): Excellent gaming laptop. Was available for $1,400, which is a great value for the sum of its parts.Gaming - this is what its for. The 2070 RTX card benchmarks at around the previous gen's 1080 GTX, although it's supposed to have optimized support for ray-tracing (I've not seen that yet, don't have any games that have that feature). The 10th gen i7 is a slightly better version of my 7th gen i7, which 6 cores instead of four. in short, this is a slightly better computer than my 3 year old gamer rig only its way more mobile. It's not a Switch, you'll have to plug in the laptop to get the most out of modern games, but it's perfect when it's plugged in.You'll want a gaming mouse, a headset, and a controller to go with this. If you have a second monitor, I'd recommend a G-sync or FreeSync monitor to make sure you're not letting any of those precious frames go to waste.Nitpicks -Speakers are quiet, fan is loud. When the fan is blasting, it becomes difficult to hear what's going on in the game. Can't do much about the fan - you've got to cool the GPUs and CPUs. They could have made the speakers a bit louder, or maybe they could have placed them in a better position. It's a minor gripe, just wear a headset.",0
"(Can't even consistently play 720p video): I didn't think it would be asking too much to be able to consistently play 720p video from youtube, twitch, espn or disney+, but this laptop often can't get through these videos without freezing and stuttering due to hardware issues.",0
"(Great gaming laptop for casual gamers): My background: I'm a college student, so I use it for schoolwork and games sometimes. I never had a gaming laptop before.I've had it for a month now; I got it for $200 off, which is a great deal, though I would not recommend buying it for full price; from what I read, there are better laptops for the price range. It has a lot of useful features, like the cooling boost and shift. I'm not a fan of the default colors on the monitor; it looks too white, but I turned up the contrast so it looks better. The audio on the laptop isn't too good either, but I usually use headphones so it evens out. The speakers are also closest towards you on the bottom, though the laptop slants down anyways so the design seems pointless.As for gaming, I mostly use it to play League of Legends, which I can run at max settings and have it perform perfectly, which is great! Fortnite is the other demanding game I play, which runs at 75% max settings; still works and looks great. Everything else is on Steam and isn't that demanding, like Age of Empires 2.The laptop feels pretty sturdy for transportation, which is good when I take it to the library to study. The touchpad is slightly to the left, so sometimes my left hand will drag the cursor down the screen a bit or jump to a different part of a paragraph, which can be annoying while writing a paper. It has a fast startup time. The screen itself reduces glares a lot and makes it easy to see in bright areas; I've never had to turn the brightness above 30%Overall I'm satisfied with it.",0
(Perfect for gamers): Great device. My husband loves it.,0
"(Very good, for less money!): Quality laptop for less money. I am really satisfied with this purchase! Like new.",0
(I love it and I will buy another one now.): I love it and I will buy another one now.,0
"it will get hot and loud when you do that, the heat has to go somewhere",0
(Excellent Laptop!): I'm impressed! Excellent product. Screen resolution is way better than anticipated and computer speed is tremendously fast! Great job Amazon team recommending this unit... I'm 100% pleased!,0
"(Best bang for your buck laptop): Got this laptop and I am amazed by the quality and speed of the computer. Really is a great laptop for the money and having the RTX 2070 graphics card is awesome. Handles everything like Modern Warfare with ease and good FPS. Doesn't get too hot although the fans will be loud, as to be expected. Only thing that I do not like is the placement of the charging port, as it is on the same side you would use you mouse with. Overall 9/10 laptop. Would recommend to anyone.",0
(Great value): Easy for son to use,0
"(looks great and works great so far.): I have not used it enough to make a complete review, but it looks new, works well. I don't have touch screen and use only a wireless mouse. So far it has been on AC but will be using it on battery soon to see what the life will be.",0
"(Good computer - once you downgrade to Windows 10): Okay, I was really excited to get this computer. It has good features and it's got good specs. So you can imagine my total surprise when, right from the get-go, it was laggy and basically borderline unusable. Programs would hang and crash constantly, as would anything you'd open in explorer. Even internet connections were unstable and slow at times.It was incredibly frustrating, and I suspect if I contacted ASUS, they would have told me to just reset Windows 11, which I didn't want to do, given I'd already spent hours installing my programs. It just kept getting worse and worse, and I remembered how my last computer's performance really suffered when I upgraded to Windows 11, so much that I had to restore Windows 10.With it not getting any better, I poked around on the ASUSTUF reddit forum, and several people there said they had the same problem, and when they downgraded to Windows 10, it fixed the problems. It meant reinstalling everything, but at this point, I felt I had no choice. I downgraded to Windows 10 and have had ZERO problems with this computer. Internet's great, nothing hangs, everything is performing like it should.I don't know why so few seem to have reported this in the reviews, as you think it would be a problem for all of them.So the computer's great. Windows 11 sucks and really made it almost unusable.",0
Very loud fan noise when it becomes heated.,0
"(Junk): from day one, will not browse in internet even though its connected, and all other devices on the network work perfectly, contacted support and after transferring from rep to rep, they became rude and refused to solve the problem.",0
Build quality is solid and looks great.,0
"(Great gaming computer that's VR capable!): QUICK SUMMARY: Lenovo has created an excellent, power-packed system in a surprisingly pleasant form factor. The system is quiet, VR capable, and an excellent portable gaming system.I don't have any major complaints about the laptop. My only issues are nitpicky at best.BENCHMARKS:- Hitman at 1080p all settings maxed using the Dual GPU setting and DX12: Average 57fps- Ashes of the Singularity on Crazy preset at 1080p DX11: Average 32fps- Rise of the Tomb Raider at 1080p Very High preset DX12: Average 58fpsWHAT I LIKE:The system peaked at 50db of fan noise during benchmarking. To put that in perspective, that’s only ~5db higher than one of our normal gaming desktops idling.We tested with virtual reality (VR), and the test was successful. We played Skyrim VR, Superhot VR, and Space Pirate Trainer without any lagging or motion sickness on an HTC Vive. This system is impressively small for its VR form factor.Surprisingly pleasant keyboard, the keys have more travel than the latest MacBook Pros. Gaming feels natural on the keyboard, and I saw no reason to use an external one. The backlighting is well done and can be toggled off if desired.The screen is gorgeous; matte 1080p looks very clean. Colors are vividly reproduced, and the screen is extremely bright.The spinning disk in the system performed admirably; I didn’t observe any significant load times in games installed to it. The NVMe drive also runs very quickly, faster than standard SATA SSDs. (see screenshot).I like the overall body of the system, it feels very pleasant to hold and looks quite striking.WHAT COULD BE BETTER:Unfortunately, there was some Lenovo crapware which I had to remove. The junk was both Windows 10 apps as well as standard programs.The NumPad isn’t laid out like full keyboard. The top line of numbers is higher than normal, and the math signs are on the right instead of the top. This sacrifice was made to keep a full set of arrow keys, which gamers will appreciate.I had some difficulty getting updated drivers for the GPU. I tried both the mobile and desktop GPU drivers, but neither one thought the system was compatible. Eventually, I had to download GeForce Experience which found and installed the drivers with no hassle.The system is heavy as you might expect with gaming laptops. This is not your lightweight, business-class laptop!The rubber strips on the bottom of the system which protrude a half-centimeter from the bottom of the laptop. I found these strips would get caught on the inside of my backpack.CONCLUSION: I used to unplug and move my bulky, gaming desktop computer to a friend's house when we were going to game all night. Now I take this Lenovo laptop laptop with me, and it's way easier to transport. Recommended for the gamers in your home!",0
"(I would purchase from this vendor again.): Item did not work. Free return but spent $38 on insurance. Am still waiting for refund. I raised the star value to 4 as the unit did not work, but it could have been from something else. After all, the vendor has over 10,000 reviews with a rating in the 90's.",0

I will be calling them to have a conversation about this.I purchased it mostly for editing photos and transferring them to my separate hard drive for archiving. Many programs have crashed and the quality of images for editing is terrible! I wouldn't recommend buying it.",0

(Apple): Apple ???♂?,0
(Good call): this is a fine laptop that very much swings above its weight class it runs cool and silent when in any day to day use. When gaming it handles it shockingly well although the fans get a bit loud when its working hard. all in all I cant imagine there is anything in this price range that outshines it.,0
"(Tiene estilo único): Durante mucho tiempo estuve viendo opciones en el mercado y creo que Acer lo hizo genial, es más q un “calidad precio” creo q muy pocos estarían insatisfechos con este producto",0
"(Gaming laptop for the 40+ crowd that isnt Crazy Looking): So Im a 40+ year old MAN, that likes to game! I also do a lot of traveling so I need a laptop that can game while Im on the road, and use in a professional manner. Sadly this is a difficult thing to find! Not to mention affordable! My last laptop I had was an Asus gaming laptop that had the words ""Pit Viper"" emblazoned on the front lid of it. And guess what.....Im now known around the office as Pit Viper! Which may seem cool, but when you explain to people why they are calling you that it looses its luster real quick! So farewell to that.My old pit Viper laptop however was no slouch. It had a 2060 GPU and a Ryzen 4900HS processor. It played games excellently, but looked absolutely silly and more like a childs toy than an actual tool. I figured with this laptop the minor upgrade to a 3060 would be very nominal, but boy was I wrong. It turned out to be a huge improvement for the 2060. The 3060 runs coolers, has much much higher FPS and benches significantly better. Now the CPU on the other hand of this model definelty has its trade offs. It is by no means as fast or as mean as my old 4900hs, but it does use a lot less power than the 4900hs which when you are presenting and dont want to plugin is especially a bonus. However its just no where near as robust as the 4900hs was. Evreything else about this laptop is pretty spot on and pretty run of the mill. The screen is great, with massive refresh and great brightness. It is clear with no lagging or dead pixels. The keyboard has good actuation and not like the short throw macs or other ultrabooks. Battery life is about what you expect out of gaming laptop. For gaming your only going to get about 40 minutes of of this. But for general word processing and work this is really where this Intel processor shines and you get an easy 4+ hours out of single charge, which my old AMD asus would only get about 2.5 at very best. Predictably the laptop is pretty thick as it needs a lot of room to run those fans and vent the hot air, but its still very compact and not terribly heavy. As like everything there are always pros/consPros;-Incredible value for what you get, hundreds cheaper than its comparable brethren-Huge improvement leap with 3060 over 2060 and below-Runs cool with no throttling-Intel processor sips power and is great for long work sessions-Looks great and doesnt look like a normal silly looking gaming laptop.Cons;-Intel processor while good isnt great, you have to trade off for battery life-Still made of plastic. However at this price point what do you expect?-Power brick is massive. Weighs nearly as much as laptop itself. You also cant go without bringing it so you are always trucking it along as well.-Acer bloatware is clunky. However easily deletedAll in all for a value priced laptop with high end components there is no equal. Its also great for the ""adult"" crowd who aren't interested in silly lighting or goofy pictures on the unit. It can easily be used in a professional environment just as much as a gaming session. I am incredibly happy that I can get away from my old nick name as well. RIP Pit Viper (you wont be missed)",0

(Wow.): Just an incredible machine. I don't get impressed often but this device definitely made the cut. I had never heard of MSI before when I purchased it I just searched Amazon for gaming laptop and this was one of the results. The other day I just saw them advertised in Walmart. At any rate I'm glad I took the chance on this brand and this device. MSI is definitely going to be my go-to brand for computers from now on.,0
(great): I really recommend it,0
(Can’t handle Windows 10 updates.): I had problems with this computer out of the box. It had to restart several times during initial install saying it was repairing corrupted files.

(This laptop is complete garbage *Edit*): Where do I start? From day one after going through the typical BS updating setting things to the way I like things all the jazz. This pc has froze on me over a dozen times in 6 days. Literally can be anything looking through photos? Crash force shut down. Trying to edit videos? Crash force shut down. Trying to watch YouTube? Crash force shut down. Alienware command center updating? Crash force shut down. This thing is louder then a fighter jet taking off on the run way. This is the worse experience I have ever had with a 2000 dollar paper weight. Alienware claims they are the top in the industry what a joke of a claim that is. I wouldn’t recommend to is laptop to my worse enemy my iPhone 12 can process faster then this thing and it DOES NOT CRASH this thing is going back first thing tomorrow morning. Do your self a favor and get the newest iPad which can do everything this thing does but better absolutely unacceptableEDIT******Although everything I said previous was true but I believe I found the issue. After hours of research I noticed a reoccurring theme the alien ware command center I believe is what was causing all the issues I was having. I did a fresh reinstall of windows and did NOT reinstall the AWCC and since then I have not had any issues knock on wood. Honestly it’s a shame because the AWCC actually has very many cool features but if it’s going cause the rest of the applications I use to malfunction I will delete it 10/10 times. For such an expensive laptop by a company who claims to be the best In the industry the fact they can’t make an app that works as it’s suppose to is enough to make me not buy Alienware again. I will say this if you buy this laptop getting a cooling pad is essential. ALSO I will say I have downloaded WOW and it runs it flawlessly and it looks amazing. My only complaint is with the AWCC but this is a solid gaming laptop IMO for the price.,0
"(BUY A PROTECTION PLAN IF AVAILABLE - COMPUTER DIDN'T EVEN LAST ONE YEAR!): Chromebook worked great until we were trying to run a software update. The screen went to half light and became blurry.

(Lousy screen resolution.): The screen resolution sucks. It doesn't appear to be adjustable in the settings. The default setting just leaves me with a fuzzy picture.,0
"(Great laptop): I received my laptop today and I’m really enjoying it while learning it, the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the speakers are rather disappointing and not as good as the ones on my iPad Pro. I placed the laptop and iPad side by side and the iPad is louder and clearer. Set up took about 10 minutes, getting all of your apps is rather difficult, much easier on mobile devices. The screen is bright and big, watching YouTube, Hulu, espn and Netflix were great once installed. My social media pages operated well, and most importantly the speed in operations is fast as my iPad. Had trouble linking my phone to this laptop but I’ll keep trying, next I’ll test how easy the printer set up is and come back and update my review. But I would recommend this product you just may need some external speakers to get total satisfaction out this unit. Update; connecting to printer was a breeze. Battery life was 6 1/2 hours of continuous play Binge watching Netflix.",0

Video and sound quality are good, and it has the best microphone of any computer in our house. If I were running a school, I would buy one for every student.The screen gets hard to see from more than a 45 degree angle, but that's to be expected at this price point.",0

"(Great laptop all around, but has questionable long-term reliability): This was my first Razer product, I was in the market for a slim laptop with a decent battery life and enough horses under the hood to game occasionally. The build quality of the laptop is excellent, although the exterior is prone to show fingerprints & scratches, so a protective skin is highly recommended. The battery life is pretty impressive (5-7 hours), given the hardware specs. The only complaint I have is that my charger stopped working after 16 months of ownership, I expected all of the components to be robust given the price tag.",0
"(BUY IT BEFORE THEY SELL OUT!): I spent a month researching before pulling the trigger, should have bought it in day one! Don’t contemplate, just get it! Absolute monster of a gaming laptop, runs everything maxed out with no struggle, I use this for work and gaming. It’s much thinner than I expected, and the screen has almost no ghosting at 144hz. Honestly cannot get get a better machine for the price. The bezels in the screen are super thin, one finger opening if great if you’ve got something in your hands. The keyboard is great for typing and gaming. Impressive that they fit a much needed numpad on the 15.6” version.Cons: battery is about an hour on the RTX 2070 and maybe 3.5 if you change to onboard graphics and super battery saver mode. I didn’t buy this for the extended battery life so it’s not a big deal to me, I needed portability from office to home, and customer locations.Speakers aren’t great, if you download nahemic sound drivers it’s much better!Fans are a little loud when gaming but a set of headphones or AirPods in my case solves that problem instantly.",0

"(Good for everyday use): The sound/volume for some of the things I like to watch is a little too low even when volume is at maxed level. Other than that, it's a pretty good chromebook. It does what I need it for and I love how light it is as I roam around the house with it from time to time.",0
The keyboard feels great.,0

"(Todo llego excelente has Panamá. Impecable los paquetes.): Todo llego en excelente estado a Panamá, los paquetes se mantuvieron intactos en el largo viaje. La laptop es hermosa, trabaja rapido, es ligera y un color muy agradable a la vista.",0
"(Five Stars): Excelent laptop for the price, buy with the i5 core 8th generation.",0
"(Great Chromebook!!): We bought this laptop several months ago for teaching online classes and we couldn't ask for a better machine for the price. We are very impressed with the overall speed and function. It has a touchscreen which we have ended up using much more than we anticipated. It feels sleek and smooth and looks nice as well. We use it for a few hours a day and only have to charge it every couple of days. My only issue is the camera quality. Its not bad, but because we use it daily for work it is noticeably inferior to a more quality laptop computer (which was expected for the price). I would absolutely buy this computer again as it meets all of our needs.",0
Extremely powerful and aesthetic computer that boasts the newest 144hz screen which is incredible when gaming.,0
The form factor of this laptop is absolutely amazing.,0
"(I RECEIVED A DIFFERENT MODEL, BUT...): the model I was sent is a refresh of the Chromebook 3, so it has a longer lifespan and I can't complain about it! The performance of this machine is decent for the price. You should know what you want to do with it before you even consider purchasing it. I only needed it for editing text and a few pictures on Google Slides (I'm a language teacher) and this one is good enough for that. REMEMBER this Chromebook model will only get supported until June 2022.",0
"(My eyes get tired easily, but overall good): Refresh rate is low or perhaps the monitor itself, it's low quality. Otherwise, it's a very good Chromebook.",0
"(Great Value for the Money): Bought the same laptop for my son last year. This year, bought the same model of the current year for my daughter.Similar to an Apple laptop for less than half the price.",0
"With the 13"" screen, the pixel density is great and makes 1080p video look great.",0
"(massive overheating and frame drops): have had the laptop for 2 days now and since it came out of the box it has overheated and the frame rates drop to between 5 and 32 fps then it will go back up to 115 to 200 fps on battlefield 4 using any graphics setting.. on ultra i get about 70 to 100 but itll dip more often.. on low settings itll get up to 200 but then when it dips down it still drops well below 30 fps.. speaking with tech support as im typing this review, most likely will return and then back to doing more research for a better laptop...(p.s. ive only installed league of legends and bf4 on this laptop and even league of legends has the over heat and frame drop issues.....)",0
"This is worth every penny a gaming laptop under $1,000.",0
(Good PC for basic tasks): Sound is an opportunity,0
"(Works very well.): As with any chromebook, it is great for most users.",0
"(great computer, even greater value): i absolutely love this pc, for its price its the best investment ive had done, i recommend this one 100%, i always preferred lenovo and this time they really proved to be the best",0
"The programmable keyboard allows for both a creative design for your home, and a simple business oriented design for work.",0
The ribbon connector for adding an SSD or HDD in empty bay was provided and it worked when installed.,0
GS65 doesn't feel as solid and I would have expected a little more after shelling out $2000 for this thing.,0
(Excelente producto): Todos los juegos funcionan perfectamente a más de 60 fps. Para aprovechar su máxima potencia hay que cambiar la configuración de energía a gaming. También limitar la batería al 60% si se va a tener conectada constantemente.,0
(Five Stars): It'sa good laptop. Fast and stable,0
it is very easy to open up the case to do repairs or upgrades.,0
(If it works): I prefer apple. I’m going to return it. I’m stillin hospital,0
(Mise à jour facile à faire.): Très contente de mon achat.,0
"(Good quality for gaming on the go): I got this laptop so I could still game while away on business or vacation. It's powerful enough to play all the games I like on high to max settings. (splitgate,warthunder,Halo Infinite). Plus it has tons of power for work as well. The only real downsides are the battery life when unplugged and the camera quality. The battery has enough power to make it through most meetings with no problems, but this is a power hungry machine (which I understood when I bought it), also the quick charging is a big plus. The camera is ok for most online meetings through zoom but if your trying to use this for streaming then you may want to buy a secondary camera that has better quality.overall this is a solid machine so far and I give a good 4/5 stars.",0
"(Do not do business with HP on Amazon. Here's why.): The C - unrated status with Better business bureau indicates very poor performance as a seller. I purchased an HP laptop from Amazon last June for $900. It had instability: frequent loss of control of cursor and weird screen behavior. After several weeks of inability to clarify the problem (they convinced me not to return it), I had to leave the country for several months. The problem persisted. At some point, HP installed Win 11 surreptitiously. This stopped my microsoft programs from working (I own several versions of MS Office that worked fine in Win10 and do not work in win11). I immediately complained to HP and they mired me in support. They tried repeatedly to get me to accept the defective computer if they would return windows 11 to win 10 at no charge. I did not accept. In June, just before the warranty expired, I secured a promise from their tech support person John Cel that the computer would be replaced when I returned from my trip abroad in several months. I contacted him several times and in the end it turned out he had lied to me because HP refused to honor his promise. This computer is useful only for browsing the web and for playing chess. This is the second time HP have severely damaged my business (the first was in 2007, and I gave them a second chance). HP is both inept and dishonest.",0
(Never again): Worst purchase l!! Is not User Friendly...,0
I wanted a laptop with comparable quality and good looks at a lower price.,0
"(Great use of momey): One of the best purchases i've done this year! I really enjoy the product and it feels really good when using this laptop, very light weight. The only sad part was it comes with 256GB SSD Disk space, but still worth it!",0
(Disgustin'): Crap,0
(Excelente Game laptop): Todo lo que esperaba en un procesador,0
(Five Stars): I bought them for my granddaughters and the absolutely love them!,0
The steel series keys are super comfortable to type with and I love the fact that they have a number pad.,0
"(No pude usarla): Tuve que hacer devolución , la compre por nueva y no me sirvió , perdía la carga enseguida no le duraba nada, mala inversion",0
the graphics seems to not be compatible with any version of Photoshop,0
"(Like new wasn't like new): I ordered this laptop like new but when I received it it was covered in crumbs and the top right corner of the screen is bent in like it was dropped. There's also a scratch across the center of the screen. There are also some small scratches on the screen and on the lid. The fingerprint sensor is awful but I expected that. The Norton pop-ups are pretty annoying, hopefully they'll go away when my trial is up. The laptop runs pretty well and is good enough for me to do school work on. I guess my biggest complaint is the damage. The crumbs were gross and inconsiderate but I got most of them with some air duster. Aside from a worthless fingerprint sensor, I'd probably be very happy with this laptop if had spent the extra money and bought it new.",0
"(Horrible graphics card and terrible motherboard! Really upset i spent my money on this laptop.): The laptop can run small programs like chrome, YouTube, Netflix, etc. But it can not run big games. Mine doesn't even lock when I close the screen and the fan can be very loud and it sounds like the radioactive detecting sound. I would not recommend because the graphics card is what kills the performance and so does the bad motherboard.",0
(Awesome device): So far I love it. First chromebook,0
"(Detalles tras 1 mes de uso): No voy a negar que es una laptop muy potente, tiene una gran calidad y un procesador muy bueno para ir a tope. Para mi es una buena compra, sin embargo a tenido ciertos fallos casi imperceptibles pero los he notado y no me gustan mucho, por ejemplo de la nada la tarjeta integrada se desactiva desde la BIOS y tengo que estar para volver a activarla, también cuando la suspendo y vuelvo a usarla el ínternet se congestiona, esto solo ha pasado unas 2 veces en cada caso, solo la he reiniciado y listo. Por otro lado destacó su funcionalidad en los juegos y gran dise?o. Recomiendo mucho el producto.",0
"(Great laptop does everything I need for school , class , and reading plus home work): I didn’t dislike anything ,love the vivita colors easy to use and not Harvey to carry around",0
The keyboard font is goofy and the track pad buttons feel old school,0
(Didn’t work): Purchased new and it wouldn’t ever start. Returned it.,0
(Faster): I like this laptop,0
"(Good overall worker): I’ve used mine for a couple months now. I can’t say I’m disappointed because I knew very well what I was getting. It’s a average laptop in all regards. I’m a MacBook Pro user but wanted something to run some programs for work as a locksmith. It does what it’s supposed to. I disabled S Mode and installed Firefox. Deleted all the bloatware. Lots of “tiles” in the menu that drag this laptop down. It’s much snappier in every way. It does feel a bit flimsy, compared to a aluminum bodied LT but it’s not a concern. I’m not roughing either of them up.*If watching movies In HD is high on your list of needs, I’d look at something else. The screen is a bit dull and the colors don’t pop at all. Think utility, school, work, etc.",0
"(Very awesome): Very impressed, handles Assassin's Creed extremely well, diedy not even get hot, can play hours on end with no issues.",0
(updates on this chrome book until July 2022): Google will only send updates on this older chrome book until July 2022. This information should have been in advertisement,0
"(Best laptop for my mom): Replaced a 10 year old MacBook pro (spinning harddrive, one-hour batter life, spinning beach balls). Updates are smooth and backing up is seamless. Able to set it up to limit the tech to just what she needs (right click, what does that do?). She was very hesitant to get a new computer, as her old one ""works"". 6 months later, she said she wouldn't go back. Its light with a for-ever battery life. Thanks, Apple!",0
"(Cant even load google): Title. The thing over heats, circulation is as perfect as it can get but still over heats. Nothing loads requires restart every few hours even with one tab open. Battery dies in an hour to three hours",0
"(Alexa build-in? Higher price????): I like the laptop very much and planned to buy it for my son’s Christmas gift, but the price just keep on increasing and I start to think if there is other options. I have decided to just build a pc since it is cheaper and have a better performance anyway. I am leaving a comment to remind the buyers to see if the price keep on increasing then just buy the i7 one instead. The i7-9750h (way faster cpu) come with gpu rxt 2060 (bang on the money) and 16 go of ddr4 ram (no upgrade needed.) Only thing is to add another ssd or hhd (2tb recommended.) Hope if this help!",0
"(Great Product!): I bought this for my 9-year-old daughter to do home school work during the pandemic. It is just like the one she uses at school. The price was great, and it works well!",0
(Good so far): I love my new laptop the only draw back is that I have to purchase a USB-C to connect my phone.. other from that everything works well so far,0
"(All in all amazing): Phenomenal laptop, amazing experience, great for gaming (keep in mind the gpu has 4gb vram), affordable, would highly recommend it.",0
(it performs like promised): easy to setup and easy to use much faster than our old computor nice screen,0
(Good product): Bought for my daughter. She loves it.,0
(Buen producto): Buena compra y buen producto,0
"(Great Machine But Not At This Price): This is actually a little speed demon entry level laptop. Technology has brought us to a point where laptops in the sub-$500 range are actually fast (once you remove all the crappy bloatware HP pre-installs). We have SSDs to thank for this, and even though the 128GB SSD in this laptop is small capacity-wise, it is fast and can be upgraded if you wish. SSDs also stay quiet and cool.The other parts of this machine are very entry-level for today's market, but that's okay given its place in the HP hierarchy. The screen is 720P, the body feels like a cheap laptop, but overall it's usable and a great option for a student (high school or younger, would recommend better for college), as a portable get-things-done-but-have-a-strong-computer-at-home type situation, or a primary PC for someone who merely checks email, shops, pays bills, and peruses social media feeds. Anyone relying on their machine for a living or getting through college ought to consider buying more computer. Anyone who wants to play games should definitely spend more.That said, it can multi-task really well. I can run Virtual DJ while browser tabs are open to buy new tracks at a gig on the fly. That isn't a huge workload, but it's important to know a laptop at this price 5+ years ago would absolutely struggle with it with the older HDD setups.Why the low rating? Well, for $489, this is an absolutely horrible deal. First, it is three generations old now. It has a very small SSD capacity and only 8GB of RAM. 720P and not full HD 1080P screen. Onboard graphics. There is absolutely nothing about this laptop worth $500.HP beats itself with the same $400 model ($430 for the touch model), current gen, 256GB NVME!!! SSD (faster than SATA SSD model like in this reviewed laptop), brand new generation of Core i3. I am not sure why this reviewed laptop is not $300 or so now. That's what it's worth. Thank you!",0
(Good bang for your buck): I’ve had it for two weeks now and I can say it does great. It was kinda slow for my standards so I added another stick of ram and got a 1tb hdd which is like $100-$200 cheaper than buying this laptop with 16gb of ram and extra tb of storage. As for gaming the frames are fantastic and better than expected but granted it’s a 60 ha screen it don’t really matter. The thermals are great never above 74 Celsius for me. Keyboard is very nice and comfortable. Only thing that would make this laptop better for this price point is RGB keyboard.,0
(Don’t buy): This laptop is trash,0
keyboard are uncomfortably hot to the touch after a few minutes of operating even a game with undemanding graphics,0
Tablets just seem so much easier,0
(New laptop): Nice computer,0
(Cant download anything and vudu.com movies wont play): Beware if u use sites like VUDU.com. I have over 40 movies on VUDU but can't watch on this. Apparently according to Samsung you can't download any apps or movies even tho you tube is already on here.,0
the port on the right works like USB 2.0 in speed.,0
(It’s good and nice color): I liked,0
"(The laptop is very hot when I open 2 applications and it stops working. Blue screen at every moment.): Good morning I bought this laptop on 30-11-2018 and I received it on 05-12-2018, very happy with the purchase, the laptop is beautiful and very light weight. But since the 1st day I have had problems, where it freezes every time there is an application and sometimes never reacts again, also since the first day of use heats up when I open 2 applications, for example google Chrome and then Skype . Or if I open an Excel Sheet and open the Firefox browser and it stays frozen, it gets too hot and it stops working. I'm getting blue screens when it freezes and gets very hot. These blue screen I'm getting daily! This is not OK!!! It is worth mentioning that from day 1 I left connected to the internet, updating windows, updating the antivirus, check the drivers with the Asus tool to see if there was a new one, and only got a new driver for the WIFI card and audio. It is worth mentioning that I am a medium / advanced user in computers, work in technology and this is not normal in a new laptop, just removed from the box. I wrote this comment from my old laptop because it is impossible to work with the Asus UX331UA. What a disappointment!!!! Note, I attach some blue screenshots and I can mention that I have placed an open source tool to measure the temperature and recently turned on sample between 42 ° - 45 °, when I open 1 or 2 applications, such as Firefox or Chrome browser (Only 1 of them) And Excel or Photos or Zimbra Mail the temperature is triggered at 75 ° - 78 °. I tried to place a Fan Cooler tray and really the difference of temperature peaks go down 1 ° or 2 °. I have also tried the Quiet Fan tool that comes by default and I have left it in ""Disabled"" mode because in this way, I hear the fancooler of the computer working at full power, but even so, while working (40 miuntos - 1 hour) reheats and freezes for a few minutes and crash - blue screen. I have the computer on a completely flat surface (My work desk).",0
(Works great!): Works great!,0
"(It's amazing! Good price for what you want!): It's amazing!! I love it so much! On this the batter does die a little fast but it does have led keyboard lights and it has 14 cores!! Laptops usually only have like 4-8! It is amazing for the price. It was super easy to set up, and even came with stickers! And a passport. I am so glad i got this one. Definitely would recommend! It came packaged really well thankfully, and with its own little protective case and lining for the keyboard. The Amazon box looked like a dog chewed it.",0
"(Multiple issues after 5 months of light use.): The battery monitoring module died around 5 months, the computer was unable to be turned on unless plugged into the well adapter. Lenovo customer support was great and quickly repaired. However, one day after using it from getting it back from Lenovo the fan died and the computer began to over heat. I'm glad this isn't my main computer.Updated: (3 years later) Don't buy this computer. It's too small to handle the heat of the I5 7200U in it. The performance is just awful when it shouldn't be with having an I5. The terrible performance is due to the lack of proper cooling. The fan is very loud and runs full speed at idle. Spend the extra few hundred and get a surface pro.",0
(Out the box and the screen flickers!): My previous laptop was an ASUS U46E it worked great up until the last 6-9 months (it was old). I purchased this new ASUS laptop with some concerns about the screen issue so many people have mentioned. Well sure enough it flickers. Total failure on ASUS to send out a defective product especially since this is a KNOWN issue. Asus was not able to offer a solution so I returned the laptop.,0
"(nice computer): computer works fine, and is fast loading",0
"(The high quality of the computer itself has compensated for the poor shipping as far as my experience is concerned): The computer itself is very well built with minimal to absolute 0 flex on the chassis when pressure is applied even on the keyboard. The spec's of the computer are top of the line at this size laptop which will very well suit my needs for grad school conducting data analysis. While being a ""refurbished"" product if I had not known that before seeing it I would have assumed it was brand new. Overall this is a spectacular laptop with incredible performance without sacrificing portability.The shipping was a bit sketchy however. The box I received the box that contained the computer was abnormally large and had 0 protective packaging surrounding it. Ultimately there were two boxes between my computer and the outside environment so there was some protection but I expect a little more care for a product of this price. The high quality of the computer itself has compensated for the poor shipping as far as my experience is concerned.",0
"(Good value for money): I appreciate that the price was discounted for a great value. The package was secure and well-packaged, which was very important, given that this was delivered via mail. No cracks on the screen. The processing speed is quick, which is extremely helpful! I appreciate there were instructions, in a small pamphlet, that explained how to transfer everything from your previous MacBook to this MacBook. A seamless transition is vital and means less frustration. This MacBook Air is very user friendly, especially visually. As someone who wears glasses, I appreciate the option to make the pointer larger, the ability to have more contrast, etc... That the user manual automatically pops up and walks you through enhancements and new features makes this even more user-friendly.",0
(Chrome book): I love it's size and ease of working.,0
"(this is a BEAST!!!): this MSI machine is a BEAST in a small package! So far we can play any game we have on high settings. We did do a few minor upgrades on it before we really started diving into it, put 32gb Ram in it and put a second 1tb ssd to handle most of the games. It can get noisy at time, but most laptops do kick the fans into overdrive when maxing out the hardware with some graphic intensive games. The battery of course isn't the greatest when playing games, but again, that is to be expected. The biggest disappointment I have for this machine is the location of the power input, it is in the middle on the right side, when nearly every other machine has them towards the back or even at the back, this one has to go and do that. Not a decision killer, but really a nuisance. I would tell others to buy this if looking for a awesome gaming laptop.",0
"(good computer): A bit heavier than most, but sleek design. Battery life is not quite what was promised. Comfortable keyboard. The biggest issue is having the camera on the bottom of the screen - it looks into my stomach instead of my face. Why?? It makes NO sense. I am an online instructor, and had to buy another camera for webinars.",0
It wont recognize a 1tb m.2 drive at all.,0
(Dead at 6 months): Dead 6months later. Do not buy this laptop if you want it to last more than a year. I actually own two of these. One that I bought from target in 2018. This one died 1 month ago after I had purchased the second one from amazon. I had assumed my amazon purchase was a new unit. But checking the serial number now to make a warranty claim revealed it was also a 2018 unit. So two of these computers died at just shy of 2 years of life. Not a well made or reliable product. I’m extremely annoyed about my second purchase that resulted in only 6 months of use time. Do Not Buy this!!!,0
(Chromebook): Do NOT buy a Chromebook. Security is awful. Hacked using Chrome browser. Had to get a book just to use basic functions. A total waste of money!,0
(Big bang for the buck): Nothing---generalbrowsing,0
"(Whoppingly fast): Just upgraded from my older MSI, I really like these machines, definitely can recommend them, this one at least was an incredible deal considering it has a RTX 2070 graphics chip. Note that these are gaming machines, if you're coming over from a mac understand that the trackpad ergonomics are nothing as good as a mac, but then again these are gaming machines .... I use an external mouse routinely, works great, and the hardware is about 1000 less than a remotely comparable mac.",0
"(Good Purchase): This is now my every day at home use computer. The only problem that I have is the hinge is still a bit stiff, I think this will fix itself over time.I am very happy I picked this Lap T op.",0
"(EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, PERFECTO ESTADO.): EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, PERFECTO ESTADO - ECUADOR.",0
"(It just works!): My last laptop, an HP, died a drowning death from hot coffee with chocolate, doh. As I liked the size, weight, I wanted something similar, but with a little more ""oomph"" to it.The Ryzen 5, 4 core/8 thread cpu with the Radeon Vega graphics fit the bill nicely. The price was right, and I've had good experience with the Ryzen cpus. I also liked the upgradability, you can add another (2 slots, one used) 8 GB stick of RAM and an M2 SSD. There is a screw in place for the M2 SSD.I received the laptop in a sealed box and in brand new condition.I first started it up with the original 1 TB HDD. Once I was satisfied it was all well, I installed a WD 500 GB M2 SSD, reinstalled windows to the M2 drive, and will use the 1 TB HDD for a backup drive. Perfect. Startups are now much quicker as are shutdowns. There is no beating an SSD for a boot drive.There are instructions on the internet for taking this thing apart, and I found it wasn't near as hard as previous HP laptops I've worked on. In 30 minutes I was back together and installing Windows. 30 minutes later with some drivers installed, I now have a much faster computer. It is responsive, the display, though only 15 inches, is crisp and more than adequate for the job. The keyboard, like any 15 inch laptop, is small and takes getting used to. But the keys are crisp enough to feel.I installed Civilization 6, and it runs quiet well on lower graphic settings. So for light gaming and internet use this laptop will do fine. I like the smaller size and weight. The power brick is small. I've had previous laptops that were like carrying around a bowling ball. Not this lightweight portable unit.No cons, it is what it is, a low priced, yet upgradable laptop that is surprisingly powerful.When I reinstalled Windows 10, I installed the HP Support Assistant software, it will find and help install any drivers needed.EDIT: 8/4/19I added another stick of 8 GB Ram for only $38.99. Samsung 8GB Notebook Memory M471A1K43CB1-CRC DDR4-2400 SODIMM 8GB44 is an exact match to the original Ram. Having two sticks of Ram allows the laptop to run in Dual Channel mode further increasing performance, which for the price of the Ram these days, is hard to beat.The WD 500 GB SSD was $59.99 and the extra Ram was only $38.99, so for a little under $100, worthy upgrades, I now have a laptop that not only has lots of storage, is very peppy, starts very quickly, shuts down almost instantly. Many laptops with M2 SSD drives, come in only 128 GB size and why I went this route as I prefer a bigger boot drive.I hear a lot of complaints that the display isn't 1080p. Why this is a problem I don't know. It is a 15 inch display, IMO this size of display does not need 1080p resolution. It looks just fine. FWIW, I feel 1080p is good for 17 inch or bigger displays only.",0
"(Love this laptop): Very fast, I hesitated between the i5 and i7 chip but the i5 works great. The laptop is very light, has a full sized keys for Enter, etc. (not a chicklet key) and great battery life.",0

"(Very poor battery life): I bought this computer for just two days and was having trouble powering it up this morning. After searching the web for about to 15 minutes, I managed to long presss the computer for 30 secs and were finally able to boot it up again. The web says this is a known issue of Lenovo ????????Thanks Lenovo!However, by the time I figured out how to boot up the labtop in 15 minutes, the battery were already at 75 percent after charging for a full night. This reminds me of those laptop we used in year 2000 which drains batteries so fast and we are now living in 2021 with car batteries that last for 500 miles. Come on, this is really disappointing.Also, as I was typing, I can see that the power status already dropped down to 55 percent. Figure this out.",0

"(Good, just not for me): I decided to take a chance with MacOS and the at the time of purchase discounted Macbook Air. At first, I liked it a lot and was very impressed. However, over time, I quickly grew to dislike how strict MacOS is with installing things like an overbearing parent. While I personally didn't find this to be the laptop of choice, I cannot deny the excellent screen, insane battery life and great keyboard. The usage of the Macbook Air is too limited for what I use computers for, but for people with more basic needs or that use productivity apps constantly, it's an excellent selection. It just wasn't the all-rounded I had hoped it would be.",0
"(I do not agree with many of the reviews): My job is Senior Business Intelligence Developer and Analyst, and I'm working remotely. To say this laptop is good for students but not for business use is just false. I'm able to do absolutely everything without lag and without issues. In my spare time, I also do music using Soundtrap. I plug a USB keyboard and microphone/guitar interface into this laptop and I'm able to create multi-track songs. My caps lock does have an indicator light that works, and I have zero complaints or issues. Maybe some people are reviewing an earlier model? I purchased mine in February of 2022, and the OS is Windows 11 Home. Actually, I bought 2; One for me and one for a family member who does graphics with Gimp. The laptops are great and we have no complaints.",0
"(As a dedicated gaming laptop it's pretty decent, but has trouble on higher settings with ...): As a dedicated gaming laptop it's pretty decent, but has trouble on higher settings with more taxing games.As a laptop for any other use, it's not good.The battery life irks me the most about this, and I kick myself for jumping the gun on buying this without actually reading reviews. I can't get 4 hours out of a full charge with light tasks like web browsing or typing papers for class, and gaming kills the battery in a ridiculously short amount of time.The display also looks washed out and I cannot find any way to adjust the color or saturation.The build construction feels cheap, though not overly flimsy. Mold lines left on both halves give a sharp edge that needs taken off with an emery board or sandpaper.I enjoy the appearance of the keyboard but it's far overhyped for what it is, a laptop membrane keyboard.In the end it's a $900 laptop that has some decent hardware but fails in almost every other category.",0
My laptop would give me a BSOD more often than not.,0
(High speed): Don't care for s mode can't do anything other than what Microsoft wants you to. Turned it off. Good speed. Just getting to know it at this time.,0
(DO NOT but refurbished! EVER!): Biggest mistake of my life. The computer had problems from the beginning with WiFi. Then it started shutting down just out of nowhere. Then the battery only lasted for an hour and then the hard drive died. It was in repair 3 times in the past year. Can't believe I paid so much money for this piece of crap...,0
(Amend your expectations): I will give it some more time I guess but am really considering sending this back. I can't believe how crappy the screen quality is. My 5+ year old fire tablet has better video quality than this thing. The last laptop I bought was in 2010... is it a requirement now that you need to spend $1000+ for anything decent?,0
"(LOVE!): I love, love, love this computer. I just love the fact of having everything in the cloud. When I try to look at some file that I was working on my MacBook from my phone, it will come up quickly and fast. Everything is synced. Love the keyboard, the features, the color and texture of it, will definitely stay with Apple!",0
(Overall a good laptop): Got this for my 17 yr old son and he loves it he uses it just for online gaming definitely recommend for a first time gaming laptop,0
"(Hate auto zoom, and auto highlight): Awkward to use. crosshair attaches to anything it gets close to. I don't want a computer deciding what I am doing. Highlights text at most inopportune times, not at my direction. Frustrating to use. Ikons too small.",0
(Value +++): Perfect for this price,0
(excellent equipment for the price): equipment with very good performance and also at a convenient price.,0
(That was fast): I recieve all the products one and a half week before the estimated,0
The Speaker sound quality is REALLY bad.,0
(Awesome deal): My wife liked everything about this gift,0
The design is sleek and pleasing,0
"(Set Up Time): To use this Computer it took three hours to accumulate all sign-in and password data. Half did not respond accordingly. What the hell is the use of a Computer if it takes five hours out of your life and pisses you off royally. I am sure I am not the only one who had to dance around the MS Windows S ploy and stop everyone and their uncle from getting me to use their storage service.Like someone said ""between Suckerburg and others we don't have a private life.""",0
"(Screen started getting sketchy on day 4): Worked great the first few days, but I was planning on already sending it back -- idk, just didn't really like it for some reason. Couldn't be more specific than aesthetic and the feel of the keyboard. However, today, the screen is starting to lose resolution, and gets all shaky and blurry. DEFINITELY sending back now.",0
"(bulky for its size and pen impossible to remove and use): was looking for a very lightweight 2 and 1 that was easy to use; this is not iy. I've already returned it. I't;s bulky, awkward and the ""pen"" is almost impossible to pull out for use (other reviews had that warning).If it suits you it might be a value for the price point.",0
"(Add 8 gb Ram to increase speed): I got a great deal from Amazon on this good basic, but slow laptop. I added $25 8GB RAM also purchased on Amazon that really increased speed. I'm not a techie by any definition. It's very easy to do, just watch a YouTube video. I'm 65, so you can do it too. I only use the laptop for email, browsing and a few games. So nothing fancy. I would say it's not for hardcore gamers.",0
"(Easy to set up and charge for use): It is a nice size, lightweight chromebook that is easy to charge and use.",0
(Samsung Chromebook): I love this Chromebook. It is everything they said it was. Great feeling keyboard. Its nothing less than a great computer in a small package. The battery last really long and charges back up very quickly. I love the fact that I can close the lid and it shuts off. I open it and its on instantly. I dont have to push any buttons and wait til it warms up like others. Greaet great little machine. I use a wireless printer. Got is set up in just a few minutes. Works great. This thing does every thing a full size computer does quickly. And they say its very difficult for it to get viruses because it has a different OS. I highly recommend this Chromebook. And the price! $200. Cant beat it.,0
"(Waste if money! Don’t touch! Problems never ending with this one!w): Such bad experiences, The nvidia graphics card stop worked after 4 months of use, and now the the built in cam. just stay out of trouble and avoid at all cost!No international guarantee so i am stuck with no cheap laptop that can hardly run tetris and cant even make zoom video.Next time only asus!",0
wifi was strong and fast as well,0
(Love it!): Excellent!,0
"(Don't buy!!!): Sold as new, but if you need the warranty (as I did because the battery stopped working) you will be refused as this is NOT A NEW COMPUTER!",0
(Great bang for your buck.): Great gaming laptop for the price.,0
it has a pretty minimal battery life,0
(DO NOT BUY): I bought 3 of these for my kids for this last Christmas 2020. As of April 2 of the 3 quit working. When trying to turn the 900$ broken laptops on it was “no bootable device”.EXTREMELY UPSET KIDS-UNABLE TO DO HOMEWORK AND PLAY GAMES!EXTREMELY UPSET PARENTS-WHAT A WASTE OF OUR MONEY!!!!!,0
"(Not Suitable for Many): NOT for people who need a serious laptop! There is no full Word version available for this Chromebook, and that’s my biggest objection. Memory is so limited, you must be a cloud-lover to embrace it (I’m not one).Gave this to my husband to Facebook and email with—it’s fine for that—and I bought a Lenovo laptop with 1 terabyte instead.",0
this laptop has pretty thin bezels,0
"(No facial recognition software): This laptop is probably just fine for someone else, but I returned it for a full refund due to the lack of facial recognition software and a keyboard without backlighting. Facial recognition is a great way to unlock a laptop, and can also be used in place of a password for many websites. My condo is usually dimly lit and a keyboard that lights up makes a huge difference. It was a mistake to order this laptop.",0
(Great gaming laptop for the price): Just amazingly fast with great display. Battery is just ok like many other laptops. Hope next release in 2021 will add couple more hours to the battery life.,0
It's intended for gaming and offers very fast refresh so you won't see ghosting effects while gaming.,0
(Happy with): Happy with laptop,0
"(Great Value, has some shortcomings but still better option than what I could find in April 2022): I order this in April 2022. For $1.5k which is A LOT of money for me to spend on a laptop. I am upgrading from an Acer Predator Helios 315-52 which I got for $900. But hey... its not 2018 anymore. I upgraded to this for a better GPU, CPU and some quality of life features. I intended to use this laptop for Programming, 3D Designing, and some gaming.Remember that you DO NOT have to create a Microsoft account to use your laptop. Just press FN+ F12 to have it on Air Plane mode. Without internet you can create local user. This is important for your privacy.What I was looking for:Value CPUValue GPUValue RAMUpgradabilityThunderbolt 4Organized IOEnergy EfficientThings I could have lived without:RGBTech Ecosystem""cool"" designPROS:- 12th Gen i7 is the best at the moment. Any 12th gen i9 will thermal throttle. So no point in paying more for no real life benefit.- 3060 is good. I wish there was a 3070 ti version.- MUX switch- Thunderbolt 4 for easy docking. Not sure yet if you can charge from this port or not.- Most IO are on left hand side. Would have preferred having it on the back but this is okay.- Customizable keyboard color so it doesn't have to stay 1 gamery shade of rainbow.- Wifi 6 while still having the Ethernet option- Upgradable RAM and Storage- Comparable Acer Nitros were around $1800. Decided to save the money and use it for a color accurate monitor or new RAM- Adjustable fan speed.CONS:- Came with a scratch on the corner... Shrugged it off but not a good start.- Gets very hot while playing games like Witcher 3, Cyberpunk, Skyrim, etc. Kind of turns me off from playing games for long... but it does force me to be more productive. I've tried risers, cooling pads, both, and laptop alone. Nothing helps. I believe cooling the laptop does have an effect but the performance will just increase to keep it at the high temps. You cannot reduce the target temps below 70. I would rather have less performance with longer life, keeping it at lower temps increases lifespan.- 16 GB Dual Channel (8+8) but it was Single Rank. Before purchasing there was no confirmation on if it was Single or Dual Rank memory. I would have preferred they could have given me a single channel 16 GB so I could add another one. But oh well.- ASUS Armoury and Aura software is more complex than it has to be... and has too many terms to agree to before you can use your laptop to the fullest.- Not 100% sure but I have heard from others that thunderbolt cannot be used to charge the laptop. Will confirm when I get a dock.- Bottom shell has zigzags.... why? Doesn't this add complexity for no benefits?- Bottom plastic shell was very soft. My iFixit ""guitar pick"" tool bent and scratched it and clips on this shell already broke. I did not force it more than normal.- Metal clips inside the case will bend very easily. Honestly I don't understand why there needs to be clips on the shell if you have screws anyways?- Sharp-ish edges?- Noisy Fan but there is a silent mode",0
(Powerful Gaming Laptop for the price.): The laptop is on point for the price. It was able to play Assassins Creed Odyssey at high settings. Haven't installed any other games yet. The screen is nice and bright. The only complaint I have is the bottom bezel is a bit too thick in my opinion. RGB keyboard is a nice touch. Will update as I use it more.Update 6/26/20: Found my first problem. Charged laptop to 100%. then when unplugged battery percentage went from 99% to 93% in under 20 minutes. I set the laptop settings to super battery saver and nothing. The laptop said only an hour of battery life. Looked into it a bit more and saw that a it needed a battery calibration. MSI has the app installed for this so I went ahead and did the calibration. Took about two hours. The strange thing now is it was doing the same thing as before. That is for a little while. First it said I had an hour and 46 minutes. Then it said I had two hours and 16 minutes left. Third time I checked five minutes later it said I had 6 hours and 25 minutes left!! WHAT!! Got so pissed that I shut down and took a walk. Seriously thinking about returning this laptop and getting something else.,0
The single channel RAM slows things a bit.,0
Seems like a solid laptop,0
(2022 GAMING RIG): Killer laptop Asus built it to last brilliant.Asus you keep on making the best.2022 12th Gen Intel I7 RTX3060 Mux switch Thunderbolt 4.Pricing unreal. Was worth the wait thanks Asus,0
"(Worst Laptop Ever!): Extremely slow Laptop. Came really slow and got slower and slower. Can't play games on it. Streaming constantly interrupted by slow processing system. All in all piece of crap laptop, more like a very expensive paper weight.",0
(Perfect for what I needed it): Works well. Perfect for what I needed it.,0
(Great): Great product,0
"(Memoria interna paupérrima, arrepentido.): Me gustó el diseño, no me gustó y me hizó arrepentir de la compra la capacidad de disco duro del portátil, lo siento muy poco funcional, si pudiera devolverlo lo haría.",0
(Lo justo por lo que pagas!!): Muy Buen producto l,0
(wisest move i ever made): this computer runs great out of s mode. with of course a virus protection. the backlight key board the smoothness of typing keypad. the quality of this note book is well made. the speedy delievery of course. good grade of speed. i didn't need a big hard drive but did give a sizeable amount. now i got my son to buy one.,0
"(Comes with Win11 which is terrible): ALT+F4 will get you past the ""Connect to the internet"" page on setup. Unfortunately to install Win10 you'll need to sign into a microsoft account and pull it out of S Mode. The laptop is great on Win 10 but no PC is tolerable on Win11. Decent screen and performance for browsing, streaming, and doing basic functions.",0
"The display on this laptop is excellent. 1080p is plenty for a 15"" laptop, and the bezels are almost imperceptible in regular use.",0
(Great product): Really a great value for just 1000$ It has been shipped to Egypt no damage happen and really great quality,0
(Not worth the money): Not worth the cost. We struggled with it from the beginning. Our pain points:1. Internet connection constantly turned off/on. Had to troubleshoot multiple fixes manually.2. Laptop freezes up running more than 1 app at same time. Windows SVC also bogs down performance. Hardware is just too primitive to be useful for anything besides web surfing.,0
"(Value): Early returns are solid, best price for these specs I could find at OD after searching for a couple weeks post Black Friday. Not the prettiest laptop I’ve ever seen, but not bad and certainly thin/light/fast. No touchscreen was a plus for me",0
(Low cost comes with problems): Turns on but with no display. Shows on external monitor. Requested replacement 5 days ago but still waiting.,0
(So happy to have this Chromebook and to say goodbye to my Windows laptop): I switched from a Chromebook to a windows laptop and I hated it. Every time I closed the lid meant I had to wait for a couple of minutes to turn back on. Chromebooks come on instantly. So that is why I bought this one. I chose this HP because my daughter has the same one and it works great for her.,0
"(very good chromebok): very functional, and responsive, lenovo makes good chromebooks",0
"(LEFT A FIVE STAR REVIEW FOR PEOPLE TO READ HERE IS THE ONE STAR AS WELL): THIS ITEM IS BEING SOLD BY ""BLAZING PRICES"" AT BEST MISTAKENLY, AND AT BEST FALSELY!!! THE DESCRIPTION INDICATES THAT THE DEVICE CONTAINS AN INTEL M3 PROCESSOR. IT DOES NOT! IT CONTAINS A SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CAPABLE INTEL CELERON PROCESSOR. THE SELLER PLACED A STICKER ON THE SAMSUNG BOX WITH THE IDENTICAL MODEL NUMBER FOR THE UNIT WITH THE M3 PROCESSOR, BUT THE BOX AND THE DEVICE CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THE UNIT CONTAINS A CELERON. THE PRICE IS NOT WORTH THE OLDER PROCESSOR!!!!!",0
(It takes so long to restart.): There has to be a problem with the operating system.,0
"(Wonderful): Great specs, took me all of 2 minutes to put a second m2 drive in. I also like that it has extra USB ports on the back.",0
"(My Top Value Favorite & Best Build Quality): I tested a few various computers over the last several months....MSI (3), ASUS Tuf(AMD), HP Omen 15, and even the Walmart exclusive.All had the same cpus 9750h/10750h & 4800H..All had same GPUs RTX 2060 / GTX 1660 TI.My first choice ...was the HP Omen 15 with 10750h / RTX 2060 / 300hz refresh.....but the build quality wasn't quite on par.As well as, the open box I received, wasn't in ""excellent"" condition.I tried the Legion 15/10750h variant with 8gb memory, so memory, could have been the issue with it being slightly outperformed by the AMD 4800h.I wanted to mostly compare Intel with AMDBut.... this came, with 16 gb of memory (slightly more $) and also AMD just getting started with fine tuning the cpu.,Although, some will tell you, to swap it.....(I wouldn't) with money better spent on an additional ssd since the Micron used is just fine and rates highly.Modern Warfare (and a few other graphic intensive titles) run very closely to the HP Omen 15 with fps never dipping below 60 and an average of 80 - 90 on max settings (no ray tracing).I haven't tried overclock (even with lenovo tool) or tested the new bios update yet.The refresh rate at 144hz seems to be exactly what's needed to be of benefit to visual quality....and believe me....it does make difference, when you rotate and move, with it being much more fluid.The fans are the quietest of any, and, I haven't past 65 celsius, even when playing Modern Warfare.Battery cord port is perfectly located in the back and has 2 additional usb, with fan exhaust on both sides (much cooler).Build Quality is the Best (when it comes to the overall design) including bonus points for keyboard, mousepad, & screen.I was hoping for additional savings/new performance improvement/17"" monitor, but, absolutely needed a gaming laptop being without a place for a gaming desktop or even an acceptably ordinary xbox/ps console.(Plus.... the new ones are coming out soon)And since, gaming is an inexpensive hobby, if used as a preventative measure against going out.... or worse ....trying to navigate the stock market these days.",0
"(Great computer for the price!): I work from home on my computer 6 days a week. My old computer was giving me lots of problems, but I didn't want to blow a ton of money, so after some research, I settled on this computer. So far, it has been perfect. No, you aren't going to be doing high powered processing on this computer, but it isn't even $600, so you shouldn't expect that. It would be perfect for students or anyone who doesn't need crazy processing power. I do video conferencing and write documents, so it's been perfect. It has a good camera and good speakers. It can run everything I do without slowing down, and it has enough USB ports for me to use a wireless mouse, keyboard, and a headset. I'm satisfied.",0
(Great product): Well worth the money,0
This laptop is half the weight for about three times the power,0
The fingerprint security is terrific - works very well.,0
"(This product is defective.): It turns off every 2 minutes. I ordered three units, returned one, had it replaced, and then returned two, don't want to get that replaced by the same item again. They all have the same problem --- it turns off automatically, from 2minutes to 5 minutes interval. How can you expect to work if you have this kind of chromebook?",0
Was super easy to unscrew the bottom and add in an extra SSD,0
"(the volume is really low even with headphones on): Computer is fine for what I use it for, just browsing the web but the volume is very low even with headphones",0
"(Great buy for the price): I love this computer. You may need to set things up on Control Panel to work like you want them to, like the Touchpad Settings, to scroll either up, or down, you need to switch them. The keyboard is NOT lit up so that was a bit disappointing. Other than that, it's a great buy for the price.",0
(Winner!!!): Great light weihjt and fast laptop,0
(Expensive but the best): Perfect lap top in everything.,0
(What he tells me): My sons schooling and gaming,0
(Good product): My boyfriend uses it all the time and has had no problems,0
The color scheme is awesome,0
"The lid and its hinges are suitably stiff, don't flop, wiggle or creak when I shake the machine with the screen at a reasonable angle",0
"(Excellent gaming laptop): Pros:1) easy to upgrade (i installed the predator series GM3500 nvme SSD myself)2) excellent performance (witcher 3 maxed out except for nvidia hairworks runs around 110-130fps)3) super fast booting time4) good rgb keyboard5) overall good quality build6) good screen (it has a bit of backlight bleed but you probably wont notice unless youre constantly trying to find it)Cons:1) it doesnt have a mux switch2) predator sense app aint the best app, but it works",0
(This laptop is the perfect size): I love this laptop it’s very light it’s very thin the screen is a great size not too big not too small the battery life is great Mine did not come with the touchscreen but I really don’t have a need for it the keyboard is perfectly fine I highly recommend this laptop I can’t say anything bad about it would buy it again,0
The speakers fire out the right and left sides around the bottom of the keyboard so they aren't easily covered by hands.,0
"(Freezes Constantly!): Got this to replace my old laptop that started having issues charging. Well, at least this one charges and turns on, but that's about it. Since day 1, it freezes constantly (Wi-Fi is fine, all other devices run smoothly), videos on it skip like a badly scratched CD (again, all other devices run smoothly), and keys ""stick"" and make long lines of letters, punctuation, or spaces without the key even being stuck! Absolutely would advise anyone to steer clear.",0
"(Slowing down): Upgraded from my 2014 MacbookAir b/c it was slowing down. This 2020 MacbookAir started out great, but within 3 weeks it's slowing down too! Display is more or less fine. Front camera quality seems to have deteriorated somewhat. But trying to open applications, download/upload files, etc . . . is getting slow now and it's annoying.",0
"(Awesome Laptop): Very Light Laptop, Nice Clear Bright Screen. Its an awesome Fast laptop.",0
"(Great laptop for everyday use, for everyone!): This laptop is for sure one of the best laptop for everyday use, and works great for almost everyone. The design is chic and simple. It's very light weighted so easy to carry with you anywhere you want or even travel with. The sizing is perfect as it has 15.6"" monitor so still pretty big size to be able to do any work with. For the price, it's super powerful and works great even for some graphic and architectural design works and applications. It's slim which is exactly how I like.",0
"(Not good for business or work.): This is a nifty little device, but it doesn't have the key features of your average laptop or desktop computer. Trying to connect other devices like a cell phone is useless, and the apps don't function as well as they do on your smart phone. It's great for kids that don't need to do anything except play the games they play on other devices and stream videos, but if you're looking for something to do personal work or business stuff, you'd be better off spending a little extra on a real laptop. The DEAL BREAKER for me was that the internet connection was very unstable, and I confirmed with my other home devices that my internet was on point.",0
"(Three Stars): A trash screen, you will see nothing if the angle is not right.",0
(Mala): No prendió al día siguiente de recibirlo. Pero esta bonito el equipo.,0
"(Pretty good): It’s pretty good for the price, solid build quality, fans are loud but obviously you’ll be wearing headphones most of the time, here’s just a couple pics and a video of me playing some random driving game from steam, but yeah it’ll be good for most things, just don’t expect the world from an 800$ laptop",0
"(Recomendada 100%): La uso principalmente para trabajar, pero siempre fui Gamer de corazón y quería una laptop en la que pudiera jugar MMOs sin problemas de tarjeta gráfica, y oh sorpresa esta lap perfectamente corre juegos como Final Fantasy XIV, Guild Wars 2, Sims 4, etc. etc.Tengo una computadora de escritorio que me costó $50,000 armada hace 5 años con una tarjeta GTX 770 Ti, uno de los mejores procesadores, enfriamiento líquido, buena memoria, SSD, etc. parece una papa en comparación al poder de esta laptop, me encanta.Aparte tiene un sistema de carga rápida y la puedes configurar dependiendo el uso que le vas a estar dando, por ejemplo si siempre la tienes conectada hay una función para que no sobrecargue la batería y se queda entre 55-60% y así se la pasa, deja de cargar, se descarga, la carga de nuevo, etc. esto prolonga la vida de la batería :)También es genial que tiene teclado numérico, para aquellos que usan excel.La pantalla tiene buen color (no es el super ultra mejor, pero es bueno)Inicia en menos de 5 segundos y se reinicia igual, de hecho rara vez la apago o reinicio a menos de que windows lo pida por una actualización.Cero quejas, 100% recomendada, la compré en oferta una SUPER compra.",0
"(Great laptop: Fast, great screen, back-lit keyboard, finger print): This is a great laptop at a really good price. The hardware spec in this laptop is everything you would want in a home or office laptop that will get a lot of use. Boot time from Power on until Windows is logged in is only about 10 seconds. Really nice screen,dedicated video RAM & very smooth & fast when running multiple programs & sturdy 360 degree hinge.",0
"(Attention programmers!! This is the one you have been looking for!): Searched for a laptop that checked all the boxes. SSD, tons of memory, functional F-keys, side number pad, large screen, clear display for small details, backlit keyboard, mousepad with buttons, AND a great price.This was the one. I work late nights and have to be able to remote in quickly. So fast!! I live on this computer.",0
"(Great gaming laptop): So fast, amazing for gaming",0
(Hard drive failure after less than a year of owning): The hard drive failed. I purchased this in November of 2018 and as of the time of this review (Oct 2019) the 2TB HDD has already failed.,0
"(Hot): It gets real hot real fast, not recommended",0
"(2019 ASUS TUF 17.3"" FHD Gaming Laptop): I give this product a five star bec. It has good battery life that’s what I need for gaming laptops. The only thing that isn’t good is the mouse pad other than that everything works perfectly and fast. I just did a battery test it last 9hrs for downloading games. It takes 1hr and half to get fully charged.",0
"(Great laptop for hardcore gamers): I purchased this laptop, a little over 4 months ago, and have been running it daily for at least 8 hours/day. Here is my opinion on it;The Good: a very powerful i7-12700H laptop that runs all of my games (No Man's Sky, Empyion Galactic Survial, and Eve Online to name a few) at maximum video settings without so much as hiccup, video editing performance is really good thanks to the RTX nVidia 3070 TI and 32GB of Ram is more than what is needed, the 17.3 Inch QHD 165Hz screen looks great for streaming movies or YouTube videos, 1TB Gen4 NVMe SSD is a good amount of storage, the case is solid but light in weight, (6.3lbs), good for easy transportation, great cooling and design.There are many more things I can write but you get the idea.The Bad: the fans. When starting a game, they become quite loud, I wish it had more USB slots, priceOverall, I'm happy that I bought it. I have yet to see any problem. If your a gamer thinking about purchasing this game crushing machine, I highly recommened it. Score: 9.75 of 10",0
(You won’t be disappointed): Great screen and graphics,0
It is lightning fast and the gaming power inside makes for an all around great laptop that is worth every penny,0
"(Five Stars): Perfect ""computer"" for my young child.",0
"The design is incredible and very, very sturdy. Very beautiful!",0
(Nice Gaming Laptop): My friends told me MSI is big in the PC gaming space. I needed to get a gaming laptop that will work well for the family. I settled on this one because 512GB and 16GB of RAM. The video card is GTX 1650 and from what my friends tell me its good enough to play games on.,0
(Awesome product): Straight steal,0
(Windows 10 in S Mode unlike the description says): EDIT looks like you can switch out of S mode. Will update after using laptop.Bought this specifically because the description says Windows 10. Not Windows 10 in S Mode. Received a laptop that has Windows 10 in S mode. Returning.,0
"you can CHARGE the laptop with a 45 watt usb-c charger, which is a huge bonus if you don't want to carry the small power brick with you everywhere.",0
"(As described): So far, after 5 weeks, I'm pleased. Item is as described... no noticeable blemishes or damage and everything works as expected.",0
"(Great laptop): The laptop is great, light, fast, small, the only problem is that the finish captures fingerprints and smudges like crazy, it is imposible to keep it clean",0
(Loved): Loved,0
"(Powerhouse of a laptop!): I had been looking into upgrading my skylake i5 w/ 1080 desktop, and yikes the prices are outrageous right now. Thanks ""shortages!""Took a peek at laptops, and after some research I came across this one on newegg. Kept researching it, the performance, and nothing comes close in price. Hardware wise, this will outperform most of the higher priced competitors with similar specs (as the GPU can boost to 130w). Purchased this as my long term desktop replacement, for light gaming, light video editing, and daily use. It compiles videos close to 4x the speed it took my desktop.So far it has worked flawless for me. I play on a 2k gaming monitor connected to mini dport with gsync, or connect to my 4k TV. I get 30-40fps on cyberpunk maxed ultra settings at 4k, but turn on vsync and limit to 30fps to stop tearing on tv.The only major annoyance for me so far is that after rebooting, settings don't hold for the rgb keyboard, at least until within windows. The flashing bright rgb colors annoy me, and I dont want to advertise that I may have a fancy laptop if i take it out somewhere. Heck, I even removed the intel/rtx stickers lol.Battery life isnt great, but you can squeeze in a couple to few hours in low power mode browsing the internet.For some reason Edge screws up the display driver until rebooted, and the screen begins flickering with other issues. Replaced Edge with Chrome, and I havent had any display issues since. A google search shows this is common, and is blamed on the graphics driver (lol microsoft...)The day i received it, windows 11 was released, so i immediately created a restore image from windows, and upgraded. Aside from the edge issue, everything has been flawless.Installed a 2TB samsung 970 evo plus in the second slot a couple weeks after receiving the unit.Knowledge level: I'm a desktop tech with 8 years enterprise experience, a programmer, and used to do a lot more gaming than I do now.",0
"(Big Time Upgrade): This is the first performance laptop I've purchased in 10+ years and this thing slaps compared to my last one (obviously). Can finally run tabletop software at a fast enough clip to stay up to date with the game. Big fan, very excited!",0
(Great Product): It came in a very timely manner. It’s a very nice Chrome book for the price.,0
(Do Not Buy This): Mine came loaded with Windows 10 Once Microsoft attempted to update Windows 10 automatically (which you have no control over) the computer ran out of hard drive room and it became useless!!! Too buy an external hard drive cost about $200...so the whole Dell product is a rip off. I am surprised Amazon still sells this Dell/Windows package. Do not buy it!!Dell did not accept responsibility nor did Microsoft...,0
(Short lived): After 6 months of light use the screen goes completely black and wont turn on,0
"(User interface complicated.): This product did not come with the list inherent on linking all applications to the Google assistant. The desktop is only referring to the little taskbar at the bottom to store apps. Good price if you don't know what you're doing, which even if you use a pixel phone the interface is different and a bit to overcome. Probably will have to watch some YouTube vids to get the hang of it.",0
(Mousepad stopped working): Ordered it in June and in December the mouse pad stopped working. The mouse pad will no longer work. This is very frustrating and I don't recommend this product.,0
"(An absolutely brilliant piece of tech with a teaspoon of minor nitpicks and one grievance.): This laptop was basically exactly what I was looking for. Before then, I never owned a true gaming PC. The only computer I owned before that wasn’t a hand-me-down was a 2016 Acer Aspire E15 with an Intel i5 and a NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics card with 8GB of memory. Needless to say, for any serious type of gaming, it was not to last. Games like Sonic Generations had the fan screaming in agony and the game would freeze at random points and games like Street Fighter V at lowest settings ran at about half speed. The only other modern gaming system I have was the Nintendo Switch, and while I love that system, it’s not the best main drive to play the latest blockbuster releases from 3rd Parties. And so, I began looking for a new gaming PC. I tried looking for a desktop all summer but I could never afford or find the parts I wanted and the prebuilt options didn’t impress me. But in September of this year I found this little guy and it had everything looking for it. I saved it up and got it at a discount of $1,100 with some extras such as a new mouse, mousepad, and backpack.When this PC came in, the difference to this and my old one was night and day. The screen’s higher refresh rates and 16 GB of RAM felt almost unreal to me for a bit, but it was a beautiful experience. The packaging was beautiful, the system itself looks gorgeous, but a gaming PC is only as good as it’s gaming capabilities were. Oh boy, was I amazed. The first thing I set up was the Dolphin emulator with Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and I got it set up in a matter of minutes and did some upscaling. With the combination of my trusted 8bitdo SN30 Pro+, it felt like a dream playing games on it. So far, I’ve loved all this thing has done for emulation. Granted, I’ve only set up stuff as recently as Wii U, but that system runs so well that I was convinced it was just some native PC port. From NES to Sega Saturn to Wii U and more, your emulation needs will be in good hands here.What about actual PC games? Don’t worry, it’s awesome on here. Personally, I don’t have too many PC games to use for reference so don’t take my word for everything. Sonic Generations ran beautifully at max settings (as it should since it’s a game from 2011), but when I got to Street Fighter V, it hit me just how much I could do with this. I can play this game with max settings on 1080p and it runs perfectly. Yeah, it’s a game from 2015/2016 on the PS4 so I should expect this, but keep in mind that my previous PC couldn’t even do this game at minimum settings and you can see why I’m so happy about this. The experience was nothing short of brilliant. And the fan, while not silent, isn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Unless you put the PC into Turbo Mode with overclocking, the fan is more than passable and won’t be much of a distraction. The speakers are great as expected, and even on lower settings are quite well and projected perfectly. I’m not the type of guy to blare my game’s volumes on 100% but if that’s you, you’ll have some fun with this guy. The screen, as mentioned, is nothing short of beautiful. Great colors, viewing angles, and a great refresh rate makes viewing stuff on this as good as you could want from a 1080p IPS display. As long as you don’t expect a $3,000 monster machine performance, you’ll be in good hands here.While I’ve raved about this PC for a while, there are a few things I could’ve wished they did better with. Thankfully, this system is decent when it comes to built in stuff but the boot-up sound is a little annoying. Thankfully, it can be turned off which I did right away. The screen, as I said before, is lovely, but I kind of wish it was a 4K panel. I’m not sure how well this guy does with 4K content, but I guess I’d rather do 1080p at 144 FPS than 4K at 60 FPS. It’s kinda up to you. The battery life isn’t hot. It’s advertising to doing about 6 hours in it’s own but I wouldn’t expect that. This is certainly something you keep on your desk plugged in at all time. Plus, performance is hit pretty badly if it’s not plugged in so this isn’t something I’d want to keep on my lap. My third biggest issue is the process of replacing storage and RAM. My last computer handled this well, with a little door to change everything on the bottom with little to no problems. But, despite being a gaming product where a majority of people would want to change this stuff easily, you can’t. You gotta take off the back, use a prying tool to lift up the click in order to expose the bottom and take it off. I don’t know what’s up with mine, but I can’t do it. I bought a Samsung 1TB M.2 drive to improve the adequate but lacking 512 GB of internal storage. But nope, the clips would not only refuse to come off no matter what I did, but the top part that I needed to get off was stick like glue. I had to stop trying because I was either going to permanently damage the insides or do more cosmetic harm to the bottom play. Thankfully, the nicks aren’t too noticeable and the only part that got scratched was the top left hand part of the bezel of the screen. But still, what gives, Acer? This is a gaming PC, not a MacBook. I get you companies like making these laptops as non-modular as possible, but you’re shooting yourself in the foot with product longevity. If it weren’t for the fact that everything else with this computer is everything I could’ve wanted, this would’ve been an absolute dealbreaker for me. But ultimately, whether or not this is a major issue to you is something I cannot declare. That’s up to you.Regardless, besides not being a $3,000 tank of a gaming PC and having some annoying restrictions in terms of user configurations, I’m nothing short of happy with this product. Compared to my last laptop, this one is the real deal that will last me throughout college. This is probably one of the few purchases I’ve made where I can say that it was worth every penny. But, c’mon Acer, stop with this bottom plate garbage. You’re better than this. Other than that, kudos to you and your engineering team earns my respect.",0
(Lo que más me decepcionó fue su pantalla . La escala es muy peque?a .Hay venta): Si pantalla es de las malas q he probado . Esta mal optimizado en w11 . Las ventanas emergentes se ven borrosas . Muy mala calidad de pantalla . Me recuerda a las pantallas de los tablets viejos,0
"(College laptop on a budget.): I first have to stress what this laptop is, and what it’s not! This laptop is meant to be used for simple apps (such as Microsoft word.), and internet browsing. This laptop isn’t meant for playing games, or for using intense apps such as adobe after effects. Now on to my review!!! I couldn’t be more happy with my purchase, I got this laptop for taking notes. The laptop runs smoothly, especially when you consider the specs. Now the Keyboard does feel a bit cheap, but that’s my only complaint. I’m impressed that this laptop has an hdmi port, along with two USB ports. I did a video stress test, and to my surprise it was able to render 4K resolution, however the video does stall and get choppy, but 1080 HD is all you need!!! I highly recommend this laptop if you are tight with a budget. You get a lot out of it, and for such a great deal!!!",0
"This thin laptop complete with gold accents is perfect for carrying around, as I will be starting college soon.",0
"(Great Purchase!): I love this MacBook! The battery life is amazing and I have been able to complete work tasks easily. I love the size because I can carry the MacBook when I travel without having to use a big laptop bag. The screen quality is great, but I had a little difficulty seeing the screen outside in a sunny area. Although, when I found some shade I had no problems at all. I am not outside much in the sun on the MacBook so this isn’t a big deal for me. Overall, great product in my opinion. It is perfect for what I need to do for work.",0
(Easy to use! Compact style!): So far seems easy to use! Love the compact style! Lightweight!,0
(GREAT!!!!): Works great!,0
"(La Laptop de mejor precio-calidad de todo Amazon): Es la mejor laptop por este precio, de hecho compite de igual a igual con una Acer Helios 300 (sino mejor). Corre los juegos de última generación con gran fluidez y tiene modos presteados para alargar la vida de la batería, mejorar performance o un rendimiento balanceado. La única crítica es la duración de la batería aún sin usarla para juegos tiene poca autonomía, pero se supone que la laptop fué creada para gaming y las tarjetas gráficas consumen mucha energía. Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra y la performance del producto.",0
(It was ok): For some strange reason it developed a line in the screen which was weird in the right hand corner and the charger went bad after not even 6months of having it,0
(Good product): I use this every day. I have had it for a year now. No problems. I would buy it again.,0
"(Paid over $1000 and broke in less than 30 days but won't replace with new one): I bought this computer for my daughter to have a new reliable computer to use at college. We got it the second week of August but didn't set it up until the third week (just in15 time for her start). It worked until Sept 15 and then the hard drive crashed. Even though it worked less than a month, the seller refuses to replace it or do anything -- they referred me to Asus. Asus refuses to replace it -- only refurbish it. If I wanted a refurbished computer, I would have paid several hundred dollars less and bought one. Totally unacceptable quality and total lack of customer service.",0
(Very well done): Gift to my wife and uses it every day,0
(Amazing Performance): Very happy with this machine. Just what I expected in performance.,0
(Dependable): Nice book. Good value,0
"(Don't buy this): To small,very slow",0
(Great. Value for money): Finally got my MacBook Air. So far so good. Value for money. I have used windows all my life. My first MacBook. Will share an update.,0
"(Modified by seller): I purchased this laptop from Amazon through the reseller in Jan 18. From the outset the sleep function was an issue. About 50% of the time it would wake up, if not, I would have to reboot the machine. Got progressively worse after about a year.At 18 months, the hard drive failed. Got notification on the screen to load operating system.Sent back to HP under extended warranty and was told that the original hard drive was replaced by the seller. They won't cover it. Trying to work through Asurion to cover under their extended warranty. Doesn't look good right now",0
"(Quiet lapotp. Comes with HDMI 2.0 and Display Port 1.2. You may or may not care.): I will get right into it. For a gamer, the laptop is quiet and capable. Although there have been some reports of screen issues, I believe those may have been an inconsistency with the first batches, and the issues have been worked out by now.But let's review some caveats. This model (82B1000AUS) comes with HDMI 2.0 (not 2.1 which is a bit of a let down) and USB-C with Display Port 1.2 capabilities. Which one is a better option? Honestly, there is virtually no difference, unless you include HDMI 2.1 which brings noticeable benefits.[Hdmi 2.0]Supports resolutions up to 3840x2160 (4K UHD) with a 60Hz refresh rate, or 60 frames per second.18Gbps bandwidth.[Hdmi 2.1]Supports 3840x2160 (4K UHD) with a refresh rate of 120Hz, or 120 frames per second.Supports 7680x4320 (8K) with a 60Hz refresh rate, or 60 frames per second.The standard in PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.48Gbps bandwidth.[DisplayPort 1.2]Supports resolutions up to 3840x2160 (4K UHD) with a 60Hz refresh rate, or 60 frames per second.17.28Gbps bandwidth.[DisplayPort 2.0]Supports resolutions higher than 7680x4320 (8K) and 8K with a refresh rate of 120Hz, or 120 frames per second.80Gbps bandwidth.A laptop that has HDMI 2.1 or DP 1.4+ would cost you much more. And, to be quite honest, if you are really serious about gaming, a laptop will never beat a desktop in regards to performance, features, biodegradability, thermals, etc... So enjoy your laptop and leave serious gaming to the desktop because at this price, this laptop is a good buy.",0
(Price low): Excellent,0
"(Bought it for school, good bang for your buck.): I bought this laptop for school, unsure of how reliable such a cheap laptop could really be. I have to say, I'm impressed with how well of a laptop I got! The material is sleek and while cheap doesn't feel flimsy. The specs are minimal, but good enough to do school work and watch a video or two (although having multiple tabs open slows it a bit.)Overall, I'm impressed! Probably the best laptop you can get in this price range that isn't a chromebook.",0
"(Great Product, worth the money runs like a dream.): Great Product, worth the money runs like a dream.",0
"(Buena Laptop): Tengo esta laptop desde hace mas de un a?o y la verdad es que es muy buena y comoda.La uso mas que nada para trabajar, uso programas de dise?o y te ha funcionado muy bien. Ocasionalmente juego y los graficos de verdad se ven muy bien y los juegos corren increibles.Creo que el unico contra y es que es pesada y el cargador es gigante y tambien pesado! Por lo que la hace una laptop incomoda para viajar.",0
It is the best slim/gaming laptop,0
(Wonderful): Easy to use and great screen battery life much better than our last,0
"(Performance is really good): I was honestly scared to buy this pc just because of so many bad reviews. But I’m glad that I did because my pc arrived early, and in good quality, I’m in love. And yes it’s for gaming also because I played on it, and it performed well. If you’re thinking about getting this DO IT!!!!! Don’t listen to these people (most of them are trolls trying to make you not buy it)",0
"(Great gaming laptop for great price): Got this for my family to use; the kids for gaming and for video editing. It is amazing! It is fast at everything and runs every game and flies threw heavy editing. It's bulky and the battery life is just okay, but I wanted performance, not sleekness. It's actually really cool looking and both the keyboard and touchpad are great. Would definitely recommend.",0
Gets fairly hot with gaming and battery life is not great,0
(Only worked for 4 months!!!): Stop working already.,0
"(it is a very good computer in all areas): it took a little while to get use to the key board,",0
"(Fast, lightweight, and easy to set up.): OK, it comes with its share of bloatware that takes a bit of combing through to dispose of. But the machine is quick, lightweight, and the screen is crystal clear. I really don't use the camera or speakers, so have withheld comments. My wife has a previous generation of the same laptop, and has used it for a couple of years without problems. This was the main reason I selected this brand and model over similarly priced laptops.",0
(LAPTOP GREAT - TOUCH PAD TERRIBLE): TOUCH PAD EXTREMELY SENSITIVE NEAR LEFT CLICK. FRUSTRATING,0
"(functional cheap laptop, suggest RAM upgrade): Great computer for price. Works nicely, can switch apps and surf fast and easy. Good storage, plays basic games and can stream easily. RAM is easily upgradeable, I would suggest upgrading to 8gb or higher RAM.",0

(My wife is happy with it.): My wife is happy with it.,0
"It works as advertised, is reasonably fast and easily expandable.",0
(Problems with the sound and the screen.): The sound of the laptop is awful.,0
"(Works well for its intended use.): This was purchased for my son to download his high school textbooks for use. Although lightweight and less expensive, the lack of sensitivity of the touchpad makes using this with ease kind of frustrating. That being said, my son loves it.",0
I am excited to use this for video production as well and imaging stuff very soon!,0
(Garbage 💩💩💩💩): Garbage!💩💩💩💩💩,0
"(Cumple): puntos a favor: equipo por arriba de lo básico, cumple para tareas no tan complejas, inicio y apagado rápido, se puede expansir tanto la memoria ram como el almacenamiento de forma sencillapuntos en contra: había entendido que contaba con lo siguiente pero no trae el teclado retroiluminado, no cuenta con sensor de huellas, no cuenta con touch screen, la parte de alexa no la he visto espero que si se pueda configurarel equipo llega en su empaque original dentro de una caja de amazon pero sin mayor protección que solo un papel por lo que podría sufrir algún da?o en el envío",0
(This is a touchscreen?): SUPER LIGHT! But I don’t think this is a touchscreen and if it is mine DOES NOT WORK!,0
(Nice laptop): Overall I kind of liked it actually. I haven't had a lot of computer like this so I think I Wont be able to provide some kind of comparison. The touchscreen although is glassy and the stoke with the pen is very accurate and sharp. Although the fingerprint sensor is kind of very inaccurate and in order to make it to work so you can sign in to your windows account you'll have to scan and re scan as many times as possible until your laptop configuration finger print assistant tells you that the fingerprint has been already registered.,0
(Chrome): Nice,0
"(Trackpad has poor response): Update April 2019. Stay away from this garbage laptop!! Asus is really careless. Another insane problem! The screen keeps dimming, and there is NO WAY TO STOP THAT. I checked a dozen forums, spent many hours of my time trying to solve this maddening issue. I toggled ALL of the relevant windows settings (including the explicit setting to stop dimming), and NOTHING WORKS. They have a stupid sensor, which in it's great wisdom, thinks it's necessary to dynamically adjust screen brightness, CONSTANTLY. Truly a first class idiotic feature, prime example of useless feature creep that interferes with basic function. So unless you want to constantly think you're going blind, stay away from this garbage and save yourself literally a big headache.I'm disappointed by the trackpad on this laptop and may be returning the unit. I've tried every possible trackpad setting adjustment, and the cursor is always a bit off. Over the course of working on it throughout a day, this ends up exhausting me. You spend your energy fighting the cursor.I purchased an Asus N56V way back in 2012. It has a MUCH better trackpad response. Note to Asus: NOTHING is more important than the responsiveness of the trackpad! DO NOT skimp on that like you did with the 640X480 nearly unusable webcam. Nobody wants to use an external mouse or external trackpad. That is totally clunky and goes against the whole point of a portable laptop. Beyond that, it's not a bad machine, but this trackpad issue is really a deal killer.Response to response: Your trackpad should work well out of the box! I shouldn't have to spend my time downloading all kinds of software to tweak your product. Ridiculous comment trying to blame my internet connection. The trackpad cursor is wobbly! I've tried disabling all the multi-touch features, and just using the most basic trackpad function, i.e, for pointing the cursor. Nope, the cursor is always a little bit lagging and wobbly, which is maddening after a while.Downgrading my review to 1 star. I've really tried to ""get used to"" this trackpad, but it is total trash. It is beyond maddening. It's always off, always lagging a tiny bit, but enough to really drive you crazy and make it difficult to be productive. It unnecessarily adds a lot of frustration into your work. Asus, this was NOT the place to skimp!",0
(Everything was great except the fan noise.): This particular laptop made an incredibleamount of fan noise and had to be returned.,0
"(Great performance and Great design.): I love my laptop and the design is beautiful to me. I bought it to run Fruity Loops and so far it's been great. The screen isn't the best. When I compared it to my wife's HP Envy x360 the colors looked washed and faded, but I bought it for the performance not to watch movies. Overall I'm satisfied with the price And product",0
"(It's Fast): Laptop arrived, and is fast. I play Sims 4, City Skylines on it. They run fine in highest settings. It's a good deal.",0
"(Cheap but it works): I'm going to college and I didn't want anything fancy. I wanted something cheap and that function well. I can research, write essays, watch YouTube/Netflix. Not a lot of storage and not great to play videogames. Definitely worth the price.",0
"(I absolutely love it): It's very slim! Lightweight as well and it's my favorite laptop I've ever had. The speed is fast, but I assume because I don't have a bunch of used up storage. The screen is big enough for me, I don't need anything bigger. I use It for applications or if I can't see something good enough on my phone. Affordable price as well.",0
"(Horrible keyboard.): This Chromebook has no delete key.How in the world can a computer have no delete key?It will not allow for any widgits to show on the screen, and any bookmarked items only show on the top bar.How to delete them? Who knows, since there is no delete key!Maybe, just maybe I missed something.But the ""manual"" is just a few pages long and tells you absolutely nothing.The tutorial is worse.I'd return it, but now I can't DELETE any of my info.Target practice tomorrow.",0
"(Amazing Laptop from trusted seller): I am extremely pleased with this beautiful laptop. I love all the features, from keyboard, speed, gorgeous screen and great speakers. The seller also accommodated my request to expedite my shipment for a new project. I am very happy and would recommend seller and product without hesitation.",0
(Excellent deal for the price): Outstanding laptop. Excellent deal for the price. Light and fast,0
(Track pad too smooth): The track pad for this machine is too smooth for me and gives my aging hands problems. And using the arrow keys to scroll doesn't work the same as my Chromebooks. I don't see where the Retina screen is in any way superior to my Toshiba HD Chromebooks.,0
"(This item didn't include the HDD memory as described in ...): This item didn't include the HDD memory as described in the amazon web page. It only included the SDD memory, the rest of the details and information are FAKE!",0
"(the best present): My brother loved this laptop. He loves playing online videogames with his friends around the world, and he had burned out so many other laptops because the heat. The cooling system is kinda loud but you wont even hear it when you're playing, specially with good headphones. So far so good ! .",0
The processor is an 8th generation intel i7 with 6 cores so it can accomplish any tasks needed,0
"(Great Samsung product! Works great as a laptop or tablet.): Nice as an tablet and a laptop. I expected it to be just like my Note 10, but my Note 10 cost twice as much. Not all the apps from my phone are compatible to this device. Its great for school, work, and drawing. The touch screen is excellent, great battery life, easy to carry with you and to sync with phone. The keyboard is pretty nice, but doesn't have a backlight. It disables when you use it as a tablet, which is cool. I have a smaller Samsung tablet with unlimited Verizon LTE on it, and I use that as a hot spot when I'm away from home. I bought a screen protector and a case to protect it from a accident, and the extended warranty Amazon offers with it. Its durable, but very lightweight. Overall nice!",0
"(Excelente equipo): Muy buena resolución de pantalla, procesador actual y de buen rendimiento. Quizás lo único que se le puede observar es el almacenamiento y la ram, pero se le puede cambiar o aumentar por otras de mayor capacidad",0
(Good for a starter computer for child): When my child goes to middle school she’ll get a Chromebook from school so that and always wanting to be on my laptop. I wanted to get her something that would be nice and not blow my pockets. My 10 yr old mainly uses if for YouTube and As a learning resource,0
"A human being, that speaks my language, answered my call in less than 5 minutes and was very knowledgeable and understood what I was dealing with.",0
"(It works.): No complaints. For the cost it’s a good value. The complete inability to adjust the display quality and it’s washed out appearance make it a certain gift to someone else, not what I really needed. You get what you pay for.",0
"(Great value, but dual booting can be a chore): If you know how to read spec sheets, you know exactly what you are paying for. Reasonable specs for a great price. I was skeptical of the 10 hour battery claim, but it's held up pretty well. Wanted to dual boot Linux, but grub didn't like something about it. Wiped the windows partitions fully, and installed only Linux. Works fine as a dedicated Linux device.",0
(far better.): Awful wifi connectivity. I ordered a Toshiba instead...far better.,0
"(Nice little laptop): I am Pleased with this little laptop. I purchased for browsing the web, writing a little and storing some photos. I would absolutely purchase again. :)",0
"(Great value for the money): This was to augment / replace our family Chromebook (another Acer), which had three years' intensive use (~6 hours/day) before starting to go wonky. It's exactly what you expect - a slow-ish Chromebook with a decent screen, and a great value. Absolutely would recommend if you're just browsing or doing light office work on it.",0
(Easy to use): Easy to use - Stone Age husband likes it & that’s all that counts!,0
It has a gorgeous touch screen,0
(Decent laptop for the price): it's a decent laptop for the price. it's not slow and the screen is good.the storage isn't the best so if you'll need a lot of large programs (like adobe) then id opt for something more high-end. but if you're a student then it should be fine,0
You get plenty of CPU horsepower and lots of blazing fast storage for a laptop.,0
(Great laptop): Worked great. Came with very little programs pre-installed and was ready to rock and roll out of the box. I had to return because of some software I am using I needed an RTX card and this laptop came with a GTX card. You can also delete the programs off of the computer you are not using which is a plus.,0
(good for gaming): It runs all my games smoothly but the battery life is on the lower end(about 4 1/2 hours of battery life on the lowest setting). Overall this is still a good laptop.,0
(Good for a 2nd home computer): I was kind of disappointed with the color quality on the screen. It was not as brilliant as I expected.,0
(Very fast lots of performance features): Awesome laptop if you are having issues with the tridef webcam activation app you need to do is uninstall the tridef software and you can use the webcam like normal,0
"(This thing took everything I threw at it and shrugged): So, got this because I like mobile gaming. Price is a little high, but reasonable considering the chip shortage. I wanted the test processor/GPU combo, so I ordered this. I got it, and ran Red Dear Redemption 2, a famous resource hog, and I was getting 85-136 FPS in turbo (running RDR2 benchmark) -- pretty darn good. I also ran Mount and Blade"" Bannerlord II, and that game does not even begin to test this beast until you get into larger sieges, but butter smooth in turbo. The device looks pretty ""gamer"" and blingy, so that is a negative if you don't like that -- I am indifferent. There are some custom plates you can put on it with the ROG logo on it if you like that sort of thing. All in all, the best laptop I have ever purchased. Oh, it is good for video processing, too..... Takes EVERYTHING I throw at it. Recommended.Pros:Stupid fast system, probably good for gaming for a whileFans not too intrusive (You have to accept some noise if you want the performance.....)Attractive, well built chassisScreen has eye-popping colorCons:No cameraOdd port placement -- USB on the back!?!?!?",0
"(This is a good computer for just surfing the web): This is a good computer for just surfing the web, however, it doesn't always keep the wifi identified in the house and we lose connection when we close the lid.",0

(Good basic laptop): This laptop is a good tool for basic computing and web surfing.,0
"(Amazing !!!): La cámara podría ser mejor, pero funciona muy bien y es muy versátil.",0
(Battery Life is truly as promised and you can easily run on battery a full day): Very impressive machine! Boots up faster than anything I have ever used in Windows 10. Battery Life is truly as promised and you can easily run on battery a full day. Last week I literally ran it for 12 hours and had an hour to spare.,0
(Works well!): Works well for web browsing and emails!,0
It runs at 1920x1080p resolution and is very color rich and detailed,0
"(Très bon portable): Je l’adore, bon portable",0
"(Five Stars): all perfect, thanks",0
"(Available for less.): Delivery was fast; device is very versatile, but the battery life seem shorter then indicated. Touch screen takes some getting use to as it differs from other devices. Resolution is good. Overall this is well made and I feel I will use it a lot.",0
"(Fantastic. Perfect for students!): I'm a student who does all of my work on my laptop and 2 months in, I'm really liking it!Some people are complaining of a black screen after a week or two of use which is really unfortunate and should be fixed on Acer's part, but the machine itself is wonderful in my opinion.Pros:+ Light (1.2kgs), portable, fits easily in any bag.+ Crazy fast boot times and storage speeds. Shut down to log in in less than 7 seconds. Having only an SSD helps!+ The display is actually quite nice, I think. Good colors, small bezels.+ Build quality is good, minimal keyboard flex.+ Battery life is pretty damn good. I'm averaging about 7-9 hours with web browsing, and some video.+ Trackpad is fairly large, responsive, Windows precision drivers, so gestures work smoothly.+ Backlit keyboard is comfortable to type on.+ Fingerprint scanner takes a little while to get used to, but now it works for me quickly about 95% of the time.Mehs:- Hinge is pretty stiff tbh, takes 2 hands to open the laptop.- To my knowledge the ram is limited to 8gb, (though somewhere I read you can max out to 12 gigs).In general, the experience so far has just been really convenient and quick. From the bag to logged in, ready to work takes only a few seconds and 2 months in, I couldn't be happier!",0
"(This isn’t worth buying): This thing sounds like a wind turbine going.. games crash a lot, screen is mediocre for the price. It’s not that fast at times I almost felt like I was back in the dial up era of pc gaming.. I returned mine after a week from the build up of issues..Personally keep looking and save the return hassle on this not worth the money",0
"(No good): Couldn't get the sound to work, windows is a pain in the ass.",0
The setup was actually pretty easy.,0
"(incorrect product description really only a 32G SSD!): Here is the way the item I purchased was listed -- and the way it is still listed, at this time:Asus Vivobook E203MA Thin and Lightweight 11.6” HD Laptop, Intel Celeron N4000 Processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB eMMC Storage, 802.11AC Wi-Fi, HDMI, USB-C, Win 10However, the computer that arrived only had 32GB eMMC. That effectively renders the computer useless. 64G is the minimum for computers running Windows 10, these days.Actually, it was pretty annoying to have to deal with taking it back.",0
"(Good but with some annoying keyboard issues.): First off, I am not a gamer. I purchased a gaming laptop to edit 4k videos, to run Adobe filters, and run intense trading algorithms. That being said, I HATE the keyboard. The AWS & d keys are white, which looks so tacky. Next the font of all the letters of the keyboard is wierd and gamer like, a normal person can hardly tell what the letters are the font is so far off normal. Lately the delete key is not over the backspace key, it's over 1 key, why on earth change that, I have to go looking for it all the time and because I can hardly read the keys am always missing it. The camo design is also super cheesy the fake carbon fiber too. The computer is fast, it's as big and heavy as my 5 year old Toshiba satellite that I am replacing, I was expecting a 17"" laptop to be thinner after 5 years especially now that the CD rom is gone. All in all it's a good laptop which is fully on and ready 5 seconds after opening it, I just wish whoever designed the keyboard would be fired or maybe executed idk. I also think its annoying that not even a gamer designed laptop can be free of a ton of bloatware. I mean really does Asus make that much money from annoying its customers with all the unneeded programs preinstalled. The battery life is awful too. The shortest of any laptop I think I've ever had. Ok so bottom line it's not perfect but I like the quality and speed of this laptop.... just keep it plugged in and dont look down! The end.",0
"(Terrible touch pad. Have sent for service three times in 8 months): If the laptop worked reliably it would be fine. However, the touchpad is a disaster. It only works for a few weeks then it becomes unresponsive. I have spent over 24 hours total with ASUS online support in the past 4 months. Now, I am sending my laptop in again for another touchpad replacement....this will be my third touchpad. Just buy something else.Update: The second time I sent the unit in for screen pad repair I was told nothing was wrong. More wasted time and time without use of the unit.",0
(Good PC): Bought this for my husbands man cave. He's very happy with it and weve not had any problems yet.,0
"(Flashing screen, poor mousepad, terrible customer service): I bought this laptop about a year ago and was excited about the good reputation of ASUS customer service and products. The model itself looks great, however, the display started flashing blue within a week of arrival. Despite four repairs including a complete replacement of the motherboard and display, the screen was still flashing. The ASUS engineer team is also completely incompetent and completed several repairs not even related to my concern. It took over three months of sending the device in for ASUS to grant me a replacement with a REFURBISHED device. Extremely disappointed with this purchase and I will not be buying from ASUS again.",0
(2 out of 3 and I'm sure they will make good on the third): Ordered 3one doesn't work waiting for a response as to what to do. But the other 2were great. They were Christmas gifts so 2 kids were happy,0
(Again with the Cord): The plug broke in the machine... for the second time. Sending it back and won’t ever buy a Samsung because over and over they cheap out. Will be sending back as soon as I can get to UPS.,0
"(Crashes randomly.): I've only had this for 2 years, and it constantly crashes randomly and gives me the blue screen of death. The chasis is not durable and the screen WILL flex if put in a backpack with textbooks. The thermals are terrible; it gets very hot when I place my finger on the metal right above the processors, and I suspect poor thermals are partially why this laptop randomly crashes. Even if it's not super hot, it still crashes due to kernel errors, unexpected store exception, etc. (which are given when I get the blue crash screen).",0
(Great sized screen love it!): Brand New too soon to comment on durability etc still setting this up as I am a novice. So far it is a vast improvement from what I was using.,0
(Nice. However I was hoping it came with Word and Excel): Was hoping to replace my desktop but it lacked the needed software.,0

"(Best cheap gaming laptop): I don't play games on my laptops but i got this one for my grandson, who is big in gaming, and he is very happy with it. so far it has played all the games he tried with out any lag at all. He also has not had to lower the graphic settings yet in order to run/play any game smoothly. Everything he has thrown at it the laptop has chewed up and spit right back at him. I plan on doing a video review on this laptop, on my YouTube channel Hayes Tech so be looking for that. At this price you can't go wrong and you can upgrade it with ease as well (like more RAM and storage). If you are a gamer, and on a tight budget, take a look at this laptop.",0
"(It's a waste of money-If I had to do it all over ...): It's a waste of money-If I had to do it all over I wouldn't have bought it. I wouldn't recommend this for a person in school or university. Presently, I only use it when I don't want to leave my bedroom and go down stairs to the office.",0
this laptop is a lack of an ethernet or HDMI port.,0
"(Great for everything): I love this laptop. Don't get windows 11. I found this laptop at a microcenter with a much better graphics card 3070 and a better battery life but I couldn't have it on hold as long as I needed to to go and get it. This computers battery is atrocious. Don't use while it's unplugged for a long time. It comes pre loaded with a lot of bloatware. I downloaded a third party application that makes it so that way you can lower the refresh rate to 60htz or your computer dies from full charge in 30 minutes. After making it so I can switch from 165htz -> 60htz the battery life lasts about 3 hours more. Like any other gaming laptop, it gets extremely hot. Oh and back to the refresh rate, this is advertised as 165htz which looks great but if you go to change it in window's settings, you can't change it to anything else. That's why I downloaded that other software. It's upgradable which is why I got it. I put in another ssd, of course you have to partition but it works perfectly. I put more ram in, and it's a beast, but with power distribution (because it's a laptop) the hardware will never be completely utilized to the fullest unless you overclock everything while plugged in. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE IT PLUGGED INTO IT'S GIGANTIC, HEAVY BRICK CHARGER IT'S COMPLETELY WORTH IT!",0

"(Unbelievably light, thin, and powerful.): Been waiting for a laptop like this for a long time. Finally there is a Windows based laptop that beats out the MacBook",0
"(Too often nthan not, it's a problem trying to get it to turn on.): Sadly, I looked at the reviews AFTER I made the purchase and saw there were many reports about this laptop having a problem with powering up.Caveat Emptor",0
"(Outstanding performance and expansion for the price.): I've owned numerous ThinkPads and Lenovo-branded laptops over the years, and of late, I haven't been very positive about their build decisions or overall quality. In fact, when I was laptop shopping last year, I went astray from my usual ThinkPad upgrade path and went the way of the HP Envy 15 (which is a decent laptop in its own right).Taking this out of the box, it felt like an absolute monster. Not shocking that a gaming laptop is heavy, but this feels REALLY heavy, and the lop that extends behind the screen doesn't help this from feeling big. But on the other hand, it was also SOLID. Not a single creak to be heard. Not a single point of the chassis that seemed to flex just a little much. As plastic laptops go, this is about as close to tank-like as I've seen.Opening it up for the first time, you get the usual Windows walkthrough, and a nag window about McAfee. Other than McAfee though, I was pleased to see that there wasn't much else in the realm of bloatware. Sure, you get Lenovo Vantage, but that's actually pretty useful for driver updates, and if you want to change the keyboard lighting effects -- and you will, because this comes out of the box with the keyboard basically in Attract Mode.After doing nothing more than installing Windows updates and rebooting, I threw on 3DMark and PCMark 10 and let them do their thing. The results were surprising (check the photos for more), to say the least. This laptop was pushing ahead of my Envy with a 2060 GPU, 32 gigs, and a Hynix NVMe drive in almost every realm.The display is nice and bright and I was surprised to see it register at 10-bit color @ 165 Hz. Windows reports that it can stream HDR video, but can't use HDR or WCG. Angled viewing is okay, but nothing approaching what you'd find on a gaming laptop that cost several hundred dollars more. I wouldn't have minded if the display could have gone a little brighter, though. Out of the box, it's at max brightness, and after a couple of hours, I was hoping to turn it up a notch or two.Overall, the keyboard feels solid. Despite the look of the keyboard, it doesn't feel as good as a ThinkPad, but it definitely doesn't feel cheap, and I'd probably say it feels better than most keyboards. I'm not the hugest fan of the offset that comes with a full numpad keyboard, but understand that there's not much you can really to do solve that on a 15"" chassis.The speakers are okay, I suppose. They're loud, but probably not what I'd usually expect out of something being sold as a gaming laptop. There's little to no bass to speak of, lots of muddling in the middle, and the spatial sound doesn't really seem to change very much. As impressive as the Legion 5 is on paper and in specs, the sound is definitely underwhelming.Getting in to the system internals is relatively easy. You've got 10 screws on the bottom that are standard Phillips head with a touch of blue Loctite material. Removing the bottom should be done with a pry tool, as there are a TON of clips that keep it solidly attached to the upper chassis. Once inside, there's a substantial heat pipe cooling system. In the tests I ran against my Envy, this runs almost 11 C hotter, which is to be expected, given the vapor chamber used in the Envy. Despite the heat pipe configuration, this doesn't get too hot to the touch on the bottom. However, the fans get LOUD when you push this in performance mode.Once inside, you get an additional NVMe slot on the left under a metal shield, and on the right is the preinstalled NVMe and wireless card, which looks replaceable. Under a large metal square, you have two glorious SO-DIMM slots. Why Lenovo insists on soldered RAM on so many of their models (including high-end ThinkPads) is a mystery to me, but it was very welcome to see that you could bump your memory up if you wanted to. The shield over the RAM pops off, but I'd strongly advise using a pry tool in the corner in the picture I've added to this. You can get a little bit of leverage there, without pressing against vulnerable components. Beyond that, the battery seems relatively easy to replace, as well.With that all in mind, at the time of this writing, Amazon's price on this just barely moves into four figures. Lenovo includes a year of on-site service, and you can bump that up to three years with accidental damage protection and still be under what I paid for that HP Envy 15 I've been talking about. (Granted, that Envy comes with a better screen and better cooling, but not much else besides a fingerprint scanner.) And at that price, you're getting a ton of performance for the money.On a personal note: my past experience with Lenovo hasn't been great -- especially when it comes to them making promises. I had a next business day contract where they took a week just to acknowledge my request, and that was pre-COVID. So take the praise with a grain of salt. On a pure price-for-performance basis, this is an excellent laptop. But if I had one show up with dead pixels or another problem, I'd exchange it with Amazon and do my best to avoid needing to contact Lenovo for anything.",0
"(Great Computer with Only Annoying Faults): There was a lot I was looking forward to with this computer. The titain graphics card told me this was the best bang for my buck and my husband has always loved his MSI gaming computer. So, I got it.First off, this computer runs beautifully. It's a bit bulkier than I expected after seeing my husband's MSI Stealth Pro. It was a bit frustrating for me since I have to travel with mine and I need portability. It's not the end of the world, but it is irritating. There is a lot of bloatware so expect a couple hour of updates and clearing that.The SSD is going to be mostly taken up by the operating system. Don't plan on being able to download multiple games to the SSD. I didn't have room for Overwatch and my windows updates.While that too is irritating, the thing that drives me bonkers is that the touch pad squeaks. YES SQUEAKS. I cannot left click without an irritating squeak every time I touch the darn thing.Overall, it can run what you need it to and it's very powerful with simply annoying flaws. Nothing ridiculous, but definitely annoying.",0
(Awesome Laptop!): Amazing laptop. Great product so far love it all. Still haven't tested the monitor for 120hz that people have been complaining about but will come back to note what I find out. Sounds like a hardware capability that they have software limited so far. Other than that this thing is very light for what it brings tot the table. what a laptop and what graphics output potential it has. Can't wait to see what the next ddr5 gen model systems bring to the table with even better cards on the market in the next 2-3 yrs!,0
(Worth it especially with xbx pc pass): It's my first laptop and it came with Xbox pc pass unlimited free for a month and the macafee anti-virus is ok but it gave me issue trying to subscribe because the laptop didn't meet certain encryption requirements so I got Norton which installed once I uninstalled macafee amd had no issues with it I use it mainly for games than as a pc i got skin for it I kept the sticker near the mouse amd put it on the bottom but the skin doesn't cover the inside so I made use of the scraps after cutting it to size and based on the settings the battery can last bit if your gaming it will go quickly and it will warn you before it turns off at 14 percent unless you plug it in but get an Xbox controller as it will work with it using Bluetooth I recommend it,0

(Really Nice Gaming Laptop): This is a pretty powerful gaming laptop. The laptop has an 8 core 16 thread i7 and an RTX 3060 Laptop GPU and will be great for gaming and productivity. The screen is an IPS screen so it is pretty color accurate so it should be decent for photo and video editing. The GPU is not the same as a standard desktop RTX 3060 and is weaker but should still be great for gaming at 1080p. Overall this is a really nice gaming laptop and is decent enough to be a main gaming rig for most people.,0
"(Traveler Panacea): This little laptop is just what I needed for travel. In addition the price was right! I was up & running in minutes. It took the usual time to setup with my APPs, mail, & login to my social sites... Good Buy! :)",0
the fit and finish of the laptop seems pretty nice.,0
"(Very good machine for gaming, compact): Super fast machine. Does not have a webcam, but that is actually perfect for my use. More USB ports would be ideal. Fans can be very noisy, and even the keyboard can start to get hot when it gets really going. I am using a KLIM cooling stand, which helps a lot.",0
"(Great for the price): I needed a laptop for database work plus some light gaming. The screen is very nice, high quality. It does get pretty hot when gaming, so I would recommend getting a cooling pad. This laptop worked great until the battery stopped charging. I had to send it to MSI for service, looks like it needs a new charger. Although, it might have been outlet shortage, so not the company's fault.",0
"(Amazing performance and value): Battery ? 10/10 especially for a gaming laptop. Avg 10-11hrs light-medium use.Performance? 10/10 Among the best for laptops, CPU & GPU.Cooling? 10/10 on manual mode 100% fans. Not as loud as you think. 100% use on CPU and GPU results in temps of around 70 degrees for both. Really good for a laptop. Gaming on turbo is quieter and results in good temps of 75 GPU and 80 CPU as well.Value? 9/10 these new laptops are fairly expensive but the performance is there.Pros: Mechanical keyboard is actually pretty nice IMO, it makes a decent amount of noise not recommended to use in a quiet room if others are bothered by noise but it feels really good and it's very nice to type on. Performance is out of this world, remember to buy a second SSD (if needed) and 16GB of ram as adding another stick of ram will enable Dual Channel memory thereby enhancing performance overall. Backlighting and LED control are good. Screen sharpness for a 15"" is more than adequate. Very impressed.Cons: The look of the smokey see-through keyboard and the mechanical keyboard itself isn't for everyone. The keystone is a super useless gimmick but I do like the spirit behind it. Somewhat redundant FN keys for fans etc. The palm rests/plastic parts are a huge smudge-fest. If you hands are clean and dry it isn't that bad but it could be better for sure. The 300hz is a little overkill as most people will never need/see frames that high.",0
(Unreliable my second Asus died young): This company has quality problems. My less than two year old computer out of warranty died today. A previous one had the plastic hinge break tearing the screen. Now my newer Asus computer is less than two years old and the screen is not working this morning. Has hash over half the screen. No damage just failed. My advice get a different brand. Asus is junk.,0
(Good value): I feel like i got the perfect chrome book for what we need at a good price and fast delivery.,0
(It's nice!): It's a great laptop for the price!,0
"(Incredible for the price): This is a remarkably good PC for the price. A full i7-10750 and a 2070 at $1400 is certainly nothing to shrug at. The steelseries keyboard is also a nice plus, as is the fact that it actually has a webcam, a feature that has suddenly become very useful. The laptop itself is also much lighter than I anticipated. The fans can run a bit loud, and removing the bottom plate in order to add an extra hard drive can be a bit hair-raising, but this rig is all around remarkable for the price.",0

"(Quick Setup, Quiet, Slim): My old laptop was really slow and clunky. When I ordered this I was shocked at how quickly and easily I got it set up and going.It is a nice slim size, and very lightweight. This makes it really easy and convenient for travel and daily use. The battery is really impressive when only using the internet and basic spreadsheets.The fingerprint lock works nicely. You can use a pin, or your fingerprint, and you can add multiple fingerprints once you verify your pin.The laptop has not run hot yet, and remains silent.The backlit keyboard is so nice to have when working in a dark room.My only wish is that it had a cat6 port. Yes, I was able to get an adapter, but I didn't even think about that and it can be helpful to connect to the internet that way, as well as printing directly to a printer.Overall, this laptop is a HUGE improvement over my old one.",0
"(Fast and light- but problems with connectivity): It's small (13"" screen) and light (@2 lbs) and very fast. The keypad is well lit and easy to type on. The screen is very clear and sharp. However, we had major internet connection problems. Kept dropping the connection, even though I turned off Windows power management for the network adapter. Tried moving it very close to the wireless router, but still kept losing the signal. Had to return it.",0
"(Cool computer): Kinda hard to move the touch pad at times while gaming, but I can get a mouse.",0
"(Great little machine): I ordered the Chromebook specifically because of the antivirus capabilities. I am comfortable doing bank business on the Chromebook because after my instagram account was hacked from Moscow on my desktop computer, I lost confidence in my own antivirus. So, I needed another method of handling finances other than my desktop. I am extremely happy with the Chromebook. It is every thing I expected and more. I highly recommend the Chromebook.",0
"(sucksss): This thing straight up sucks. It's slap full of bloatware and you can't uninstall half of it. It doesn't have the power to run any kind of browser other than Microsoft Edge, and that browser isn't exactly uhhhh useful. It legit can't handle more than one tab at a time, and even then it takes forever. It is 100% not my internet, either. Even tried a wired connection and still got the same. It's just a crappy piece of hardware, so I guess it is true that you get what you pay for.At least it's lightweight and basically never dies.",0

"(CRASHES ALL THE TIME): I REALLY REALLY wanted to like it. I was REALLY hoping for a good experience with transitioning from Macbook PRO to chromebook since most of my workflow would be on the internet but 400 bucks down a hole and full of regrets that I hoped the chromebook could ""handle"" more than web browsing.LIKES: light weight, decent battery life and snappy with chrome browser. Also reboots fast with the reliable and regular multiple-times-a-day crashes.DISLIKES: anything more than web-browsing is sluggish (not surprised, sure but I had high hopes) but really the only reliable aspect of it is how it unfailingly crashes multiple times a day, reliably crashes and reboots. At least reboots fast.- Has done the chromebook wash multiple times- Got rid of all the extensions one at a time- Has deleted then re-installed Apps (only a few)Gotten to the point where multiple crashes a day is now just part of the workflow until the new laptop comes after a period of denial and disappointment.",0
(My samsung phone is attached to my chromebook as well. I love it...): I find this chromebook very freindly to use. My grandson caught on real quickly on how to use it. I just love it. I got mine ater my 17 y old daughter got one and used it for school and she as well loves it. I would forsure recommend people to buy this for it is affordable as well.,0
"(Slow): With hardly any apps installed, this Chromebooks internet speeds get only 1/3 of every other device using our home's wifi. I expect a Chromebook to last a lot longer than this one does, which is still nice at 6 hrs. I had an Acer Chromebook previously, which I prefer. This is heavier, shorter battery, and slower than something that was purchased 5 years ago.",0
(I wish they would put a discount drive back in.): The tuch pad needs to be moved to the left or right why this hasn't been done all ready some one needs to think about that.,0
"(Final straw): This is the third and final time I let Asus get away with scamming me.first 2 laptops I got were DOA, this one might as well have been.After using it for over a year, I can say it's the single worst laptop I've ever owned.The fingerprint scanner only works 10% of the time.The 2-in-1 tablet mode doesn't play well on windows 10, and keeps getting stuck with the onscreen keyboard in laptop mode.It crashes whenever the screen shuts off, and has to be power cycled to come back on.It's lost all network devices twice, which I had to manually install from a usb.This will be the last Asus product I ever buy",0

"(Perfect for work!): I'm so glad I purchased this laptop. I first got the 17"" version from costco and it had issues from the start. I never got it to work properly. I found this one on amazon and decided to take a chance. Best decision ever. The smaller vesion is also more practical - it will fit the carryon luggage better and it's soooooo light. I love it. Also, I use it for business - quickbooks and some design software and it's super fast and can handle all my work without freezing on me. Even though it's so light the shell is super tough - I sat on it accidentally and there was no damage! If you're looking for a work laptop with large RAM, that's light weight this is the one. It also said it didn't have the touch screen but it does! Cherry on top!",0
"(Wouldnt buy again.): My number keys went out just when I hit the 1 yr warranty mark. Lenovo said they only offer 1 yr warranty on items sold through Amazon, so they wouldnt repair it. Its a common issue needing the hardware serviced. I was surprised to see so many similar complaints on a pricey electronic, that the manufacturer wouldnt resolve 1 day after the year mark. -There was also a different date they had registered in their system for the purchase date, but passing the actual 1 yr receipt, they were not going to assist with the repair.",0

"(Woww!!! - From a Die-hard MacBoy): This is my first non-Mac computer in 15 years, and all I can say is Apple lost my business for not making a 15"" MacBook Air. Hopefully some day in the near future. The Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro is a wow machine though!!To have a like for like comparison I bought a MacBook Air (13.3"") and The Galaxy Book2 Pro (15.6"") together ... and the 15.6"" Samsung is lighter than the 13.3"" MacBook Air!! Let that sink for a bit. The dog-eat-dog world has gotten so crazy that 15.6"" laptops have gotten lighter than 13.3"" Ultra-premium laptops!!! What a wonderful time to be alive :)About the Samsung Galaxy Book2Pro:The Pros:1. Great Display - Easily better than the MacBookAir (No, I don't mean that the blacks are better, or picture is sharper. Just that a 15.6"" inch AMOLED display will any day blow away a 13.3"" inch Retina display. Not because is AMOLED is better than Retina, but that 15.6"" vs 13.3"" is a hump that you can not cross.2. Insanely light weight: This is perhaps the lightest laptop that I have handled. The fact that it is 15.6"" laptop is insane!3. Noise: I believe that there is a fan, however I have never heard it. So far I use it to Code - AI/ML and consume media (Hi-Def movies/Series)4. Keyboard and track-pad - High-quality keyboard and trackpad. I don't click on the track-pad, but tap instead. That makes the experience ultra-premium and noiseless.5. Connections: While it is true that anyone plonking 4 figure $$ for a laptop, can also buy $20-$30 connectors, it does feel good to have a HDMI out built in along with 2 USB-Cs, 1 USB-A, and one micro-SD card. This an AHA moment - with the MicroSD card slot, you can expand your storage by orders of Terabytes as Micro-SD cards become increasingly cheaper.The meh:1. Battery life: - I am not one to drain my battery life entirely or reduce brightness to reduce recharge frequencies. As such I see that I have to recharge at the end of 8-9 hours. Not majorly complaining, but I would say that it will worsen with age.The Bad:1. The Stickers: It is down-right fugly when there are stickers on your laptop. I have one for energy star and one for Intel Evo. I wish these things would stop on Windows laptops.2. The speakers: I cant really hear a difference in loudness as compared to my MacBook Air, but these speakers are not very loud.3. The Hinge: The screen hinge wobbles (ever so slightly). It remains set once the angle screen angle is fixed, but I was disappointed to find screen-wobble, having come from the Mac-world.Overall - Is this a MacBook killer? - Depends. You can get a fully souped-up MacBook Air - 8 Core CPU and 8 Core GPU, 16GB Ram and 1 TB SSD for $1650 (at the time of writing). The Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro costed me about $1150. While the MacBook Air is fan-less, and will have more power and battery life - It will always be heavier than the Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro, and have a smaller screen, not to mention $500 more expensive. That is what it comes down to. I am going to keep this laptop, since as of now Apple has nothing to compete in the 15"" ultra-light, ultra-premium laptop space.",0
"(The real deal for the right specs): I'll save myself the time of echoing the praise that this model has gotten which I overall agree with and instead provide benchmarks I've taken. In Time Spy, the i7-10750H and RTX 2070 score around 6800 and 7850 with a 94.7 mV and 163 mV undervolt to reach 1920 MHz at 868 mV, in ThrottleStop and MSI Afterburner respectively. The RTX 2070 in this model has a higher core clock than standard spec, at 1260 - 1455 MHz vs. 1215 - 1440MHz, which could account for the graphics score being higher than the median on Notebookcheck of 7722 and for comparison is 100 - 200 more than for the desktop RTX 2060. The CPU temperature does get into the upper 90s °C with default settings, but this can be helped with adjusting the fan curve in Dragon Center so that it stays in the 80s at most, or disabling turbo boost, if the performance uplift isn't of concern, after which for mine the CPU and GPU idle at 41 and 40°C, and the fans whir quietly for a short duration between long intervals where they're not spinning and the entire machine is completely silent. (I haven't timed this, but it feels long enough to not remember when they were last spinning.) I haven't repasted as that'd void warranty, tho it'd help to lower temps further. The i7-10750H of course isn't the main draw here, but it's nice to have it fully configurable from the MSI BIOS, whereas that can't be said for those of other manufacturers.My only complaint is the speakers on mine, situated under the right palm rest, have a few times gotten misaligned, which owes to carrying it in a backpack, causing the touchpad and palm rest to make a rattling sound when tapped, and to a lesser extent even the keys when pressed, tho very faintly. This was easily and quickly fixed by opening the laptop with the aid of an opening pick and realigning the speakers. There are videos that show exactly how to disassemble the GL65 Leopard series.The per-key RGB is easily configurable in SteelSeries Engine 3 and to me easily worth any extra cost compared to similarly specced laptops by virtue of just how pleasing it is to look at, mesmerizing really, as someone who prior had never used a per-key RGB configurable keyboard.I rarely use this laptop without the power plugged in, hence why I can't say anything about the battery life, tho I'm well aware of how low it is from reviews. I haven't tested how long it lasts with turbo disabled, which I expect would help the most in extending battery life. One last thing - make sure to get the latest BIOS and EC firmware, and it's golden.",0

"(A big step up in performance!): I have owned the original Samsung Chromebook Plus for three years now, have generally been satisfied, especially as the maturation of the Chrome OS has progressed. A cracked screen that was only marginally annoying, and some mysterious problems with its WIFI capability caused me to consider a change, but the costs for the performance gains I wanted from a switch didn't seem worth the cost. I briefly tried a Samsung Pro and a Google Pixelbook, but neither pleased me enough to keep them. I now have a new Samsung Plus v2 with the M3 processor, and couldn't be happier. This thing reminds me of moving from a BMW 540i to a BMW M5...same basic shell, but a wholly different experience. I'm glad I waited until prices began to fall after CES 2020! We can be certain that chromebooks will continue to improve in performance, but I suspect that the barebones speediness and muscle of the truly efficient chromebooks will go through an extended period of flabbiness and useless adornment until the next truly great design emerges. My 2024 termination of OS improvements will doubtless keep me happy until then. Buy one of these beauties now; you'll be glad you did!",0
(Processor boot up very fast): I bought this 13.3 inch Asus Zenbook SSD to replace my old 15.6 inch Gateway HDD laptop. I must say this Asus Zenbook is one of the best laptop in terms of performance for under $1000.00 USD. Below are my findings:1. Processor boot up in less than 10 seconds2. Finger print sensor work perfect3. Battery life at 99% can give up to 10hrs4. Light weight less than 2.5lbsExcellent choice. I would recommend it.,0
"(Publicidad enga?osa): Pros: La computadora es buena, su pantalla es excelente con buen brillo, la velocidad es acorde y lo que se espera por lo adquirido, el teclado es suave, teclado iluminado con opción de apagar, la calidad y materiales se ven buenos o duraderos, agrada la facilidad ara actualizar o mejorar la laptop.La durabilidad de la batería es decente, aun escuchando audio.Contra: Indicaban que vendría por la compra del portátil el Game de Call Of Duty Modern of War lo cual nunca sucedió, también decía que llegaría con sticker y no fue así.me preocupa un poco la durabilidad del pad mouse.Los parlantes para ser 7.1 no tienen la calidad de volumen que uno esperaria.",0
(How do i get it to Work.): Nothing is coming up on the screen. The WI FI is good. Called the phone comp. They are saying its the Lap top.,0
(Extremely disappointing quality): This computer runs incredibly slow. If someone had told me that it was over 10 years old I would believe them. I am very disappointed and frustrated.,0
"(Decent strong gaming Laptop for current price/tech available): As with MSI, comes with 4 battery modes, each favoring a different performance costing different battery live-Extreme Performance (Fans go on full blast for resource intensive games, super loud, use headphones, try not to be around other or they will be annoyed by the fans)-Balanced (Good for average performance of lasting ~1 1/2 hr without a charger depending on the game to still get 70-100+ fps)-Silent (basically battery saver mode)-Super Battery (kind of laggy, battery lasts 6+ hrs)Speaker sound comes from the back of the board, and sounds kind of gone, so best to get Headphones with it.Didn't come with any dead pixels, blue screens, broken bits.TL:DR Good price for current tech, just get a pair of headphones with it (Fan can be super loud when playing games)",0
"(Completamente increíble!!!!!!): Una excelente laptop por parte de Samsung, es que la verdad no tiene ningún punto en contra, por que todo esta completamente bien elaborado, la pantalla, el touchpad, el teclado, la durabilidad de la batería, el tremendo procesador que tiene y adicionalmente una tarjeta grafica integrada decente, claro a mi gusto de la manera en que yo la utilizo (programas java, AutoCAD, creación de contenido y algunos juegos decentes).",0

"(LOVE my Predator. It’s a BEAST): TL:DR Well designed power user/gamer/VR laptop with decent hardware for the price! Works with Oculus Quest 2.I’m a power user: 3D CAD, 2D CAD, graphic design, video editing…all at the same time as I’ll use the same graphics between them all! I also use it with my Oculus Quest to play Steam games and it works flawlessly! Good hardware packed into the price. Great value. It's ready for Windows 11 too but I think I'll wait a few years for MS to finish it before upgrading haha. The build quality is great and if you are a gamer the TURBO button will overclock the machine without you having to do anything. Great gaming laptop for the price hands-down!",0
(Chromebooks are quick boot ups and perfect for web surfing): The best way to surf the web. Quick and easy.,0
"(Better off gaming on a used smartphone): The device thermal throttles 5 minutes into playing light games. No amount of googling can fix this and the warranty with asus is short and terrible. ASUS' customer service is very limited and resorts to mailing your computer in if plan A (bios reset) doesen't work.The fans are ramped up constantly due to unstable power usage or who know what.What we have here, is a loud, 20fps, crappy track padded computer. The point of switching to windows was to get a bit more for my money as opposed to picking up a MacBook pro, but your money is all wasted by this computer's failure to regulate its temperatures and workload.You're better off gaming on a used smartphone.",0

"(It's exactly as advertised.): This for my personal home use. I'm not a gamer so I can't comment on how it would preform gaming. It does, however, do everything I want it to do. It has a lot of storage and is very fast. It's a great replacement for my old HP laptop.",0
"(Amazing laptop): A great laptop overall, especially if you get it on sale.",0
"(Good Luck if you end up requiring warranty service): The Laptop was fine up until the end of first month from purchase, when the laptop got dead pixel. So, I called the Lenovo premium care to rectify the issue, they said they wanted me to take the machine to Best Buy to see/confirm the issue with Geek Squad before they could take action. I got the Geek Squads written report confirming what I said to Lenovo. So, I call the customer care again with this confirmation and the agent wanted to again see the issue via video and I agreed and then he issued an onsite warranty repair to replace the LCD Panel. The first technician came and replaced the LCD but he broke the Bezel in the process and then he arranged for a second repair to replace the bezel. (The second technician did not arrive in the said date and I had to call in to find out on when it would happen – no proper communication) A week later the second technician came and he in the process of replacing the bezel cracked the screen. Then the second technician arranged for a third service. A week later the third technician came to replace the screen but the screen did not match the laptop and so it would not work and also he did not put back the bezel back properly. The third technician arranged for a fourth service. The next day I called Lenovo premium care and I delayed the service for a week. After this deferred week I called Lenovo to know when they would arrive and they said it will a take a further week – there was no communication here again and I had to call in to find out. By now the Laptop was having issues for a month with multiple failed onsite repair and lack of communication for a Laptop that was past the two-month mark.So, I called Lenovo premium care for a refund, they said only the customer relationship agent (another department) can do it and that they will mail or call me about it. Later that day I get a mail saying that they will fix it in a week (which is nothing new and is not the communication expectation set). The next day I call the Lenovo number for return for a refund and I said the whole scenario and they asked me for the order number so they can refund. Since the order was through Amazon, they say they cannot process the refund. I called Amazon for the refund due to the scenario and they put me through Lenovo (not clear why) and this time the Lenovo agent said they cannot replace the machine or issue the refund and only do a warranty repair, going on and on about their policy in spite of repeated bad service for a new product. Again, I called Amazon customer service and they said they can take the Laptop back but for a 20% restocking fees as it is outside the 30 day period. I said I am asking for a refund for the issue of the manufacturer and because I purchased to through Amazon so the refund can be done through Amazon (as mentioned by Lenovo). Then the Amazon agent was repeating their policy and their internal process. I said the responsibility should stop somewhere and I cannot spend any more time going back and forth repeating this issue on each phone call and asked to get Lenovo also on the call as I cannot waste any more time due to this issue and the call wait took a long time to get a Lenovo representative online, after some time of hold the Amazon representative said they will contact me in an hour. Then the Amazon representative called me a said they will process the full refund. Relieved!If you happen to a get an issue with the laptop, good luck with customer service and resolution for an otherwise good laptop. Some of my cons for the laptop based on my experience:1. The UEFI screen cannot be accessed via external display if the laptop display is not working/available.2. The laptop has poor reparability if not then the repair service is bad.3. Web cam quality is bad4. CPU is not cooled well.Pros:1. Good port selection and placement2. The display in this model has good image quality3. Subjective: No RGB and not fancy looking and is functional4. Good Keyboard5. GPU is cooled wellP.S: When calling a Lenovo representative the call message till you get connected, touts you to take the onsite warranty so you have less downtime. Guess the word down time is very flexible as you see here.",0

"(Value for money.): This product is in superb Condition, no complaints.",0
"(CORRUPTED VERSION OF WINDOWS 10): The laptop itself is great... super fast! However, amazon loaded it with a corrupted version of Windows 10 that lead to severe issues a month after purchase and I had to pay to have a non corrupted version installed with all updates from Best Buy’s GeekSquad. Huge pain. In the future I will just buy a laptop from Best Buy and avoid the gamble. Pay the extra $150 to buy it local and avoid bootlegged/corrupted operating systems without warranties.",0
It is slim and lightweight.,0
"(Great laptop): Not a tech kinda person. I just wanted a laptop for uni that would be able to use word and PowerPoint and let me watch my lecture videos. Well, it’s fantastic. Nice and lightweight, thin, sleek and works really well. The best part is that the battery lasts for ages! I use my laptop every day for uni (~6 hours a day maybe more or less depending on the day) and I’ll charge it probably 4 times a week! Love this laptop, definitely recommend!",0
(For the price it’s ok): The mouse is very touchy. I had a hard time setting up any short cuts,0
"(This is the worst piece of garbage I've ever bought): This is the worst piece of garbage I've ever bought. If it wasn't such a hassle to send back, I would. So therefore I'm going to take a sledgehammer to it. Extremely dissatisfied!!!!",0
"(Best Value Bar None): To be clear I bought this laptop as a budget gaming pc for travel use. I did not expect the performance it gives and have been extremely impressed with the way it handles gaming. While some of the hardware may not be current gen, note the 9th gen I5, it still comes with USB type-c and 2 3.1 type A connections. Combine this with a 4gb discrete GPU and 8gb of DDR4 ram and you get an amazing gaming rig for $629. I currently use my tower for heavy lifting but love to curl up in the couch in the evenings with my Nitro 5.",0
(Compact and Everywhere Useable Laptop): Completely great product for price great performance and absolutely love the extreme cooling function,0
(Nice gaming laptop for the price): Looks sleek and nice. So far seems really good for the price. Wifi is fast and the screen quality is really nice. If you plan to use it for comp gaming buy a mouse.,0
"(Dead pixels on the screen): My laptop has dead pixels on the screen, and Amazon didn't replace it because I ship it on Freight Forwarder company address. I am very disappointed",0
(Great laptop for the price): This is a great little laptop. I bought one for me and my husband. I use it mainly for searching stuff on the internet for printing etc. Touch screen is awesome. My husband uses it for invoices and other work related tasks. Battery life is great. Easy to set up and get started. Very user friendly.,0
(FIVE STARS): A+,0
(Speaker broken in a year): The speaker has already stopped working on this device. It's only a year old.,0
"(Snappy with great battery life): I bought this to replace my Mid 2012 Macbook Pro, which was suffering from some dismal battery life and other general struggles. I'm not an Apple Fanboy, but have to give Apple side props for making a computer that was functional for 10 years.Getting behind the new M2 Air has been so satisfying. Incredibly snappy, and I've been working on the same charge for several days! Also, I love the new Midnight color.My wife has the previous M1 Air, which is similarly snappy. Honestly, the only reason I held out (and paid a few hundred more) was for the Magsafe charging. (We have a puppy and a baby, and one of the two will be tugging on cords).Overall, very happy with the purchase. Seems like the nice quality that people expect out of Apple.",0

"(great gaming laptop): Great gaming notebook, this is my most satisfying electronic product of the year",0
"(Screen is horrible, but not a bad little laptop): Runs fast, boots up almost immediately. My only issue is that the screen is really bad.The main issue with the screen is viewing angle. I think some other people have brought up that many of the positive reviews are of the previous model year (same model, a year prior) which had a much better screen. Viewed from below perpendicular it gets dark very quickly. Viewed from above perpendicular and it washes out almost immediately. View head on and the top will be dark while the bottom is bright and washed out. Using the home screen and bright apps it's not too bad, but trying to watch videos it's unbearable.",0
"(Very good gaming and content creation laptop at a fair price.): The Acer Predator Helios 300 is a mid-tier gaming laptop. The metal and plastic construction, makes a bit sturdy and it comes with very good hardware in this price point.The screen is bright enough, better than the advertised 300 nits. It was able to reach 300 nits at around 75% brightness, and at 100% brightness it went up to 371 nits...not to shabby for a gaming display.The display is fast at 144Hz @ just 3 ms and the color gamut was quite good 99% sRGB and 78% aRGB and just 83% DCI-P3. It should be able to handle photo and video editing and content creation like champ.There is a bit of light bleed on top right and top left of the display on the unit I have.The keyboard has a backlit 4-zone RGB and the it isn't bad, but the keys are a bit mushy to the touch. I just prefer a firmer keyboard keys...maybe I am bias because I use a mechanical keyboard. The Microsoft Precision Touchpad worked without issues and has been very responsive and accurate.The USB C 3.2 Gen 2 port comes with Thunderbolt 4 and USB Charging and next to those ports HDMI 2.1 with HDCP support and Mini DisplayPort 1.4. There are two USB A 3.2 Gen 1 ports and USB A 3.2 Gen 2 that supports Power-off Charging.The Thunderbolt port is might fast. I was able to reach 8.5 Gbit/s (1062 MB/s) speed copying files. You could transfer a 4k 25GB film in 20 secondsThe Predator Helios 300 comes with a full Gigabit Ethernet port so you won't lag for lack of reliable Internet connection.And if you happen to have a Wi-Fi 6 internet, the Killer Wi-Fi 6 is as fast as the Gigabit LAN.The sound is tiny, since the firing down speakers are tiny. The speaker area is 19mm thick and some laptop as thin as 13mm have been able to fit louder and better sounding speakers...of course they cost a lot more.A least Acer included Dolby DTS X software that works great with external surround speakers or headphones, and you will need them if you want real sound.There are 2 DDR4 RAM slots, each one with 8 GB DDR4 3200 MHz RAM for a 16GB DDR4 total, upgradeable to 64GB DDR4.Acer included 2 NVMe M.2 slots, one occupied by a lighting fast 512GB Samsung PCIe 4x4 NVMe capable of 6900 MB/s read and 5000 MB/s write speeds. Also there is a 2.5"" SATA bay available. Acer included the SATA cable and screws in the box. In case you have a 2.5"" HDD or SSD lying around and don't want part ways.During tests the Samsung NVMe went above rated speeds on both read and write performance.The battery is on the small size for a 15.6"" gaming laptop. I would have prefer a larger capacity battery, instead of a 2.5"" SATA bay. At least Acer came up front about the battery running time. They stated the 6 hours and how they achieved that results (Battery life was tested using video playback).So make sure you have the power adapter next to you while gaming, since the battery won't last much unless you dial down screen brightness and disable the dedicated graphics.The Predator Sense App have several settings to adjust lighting, fan speed and performance settings. There is 'Default', 'Extreme' and 'Turbo' options available. Setting the system to 'Turbo' increases system performance and consequently also increases fan speed exponentially. Of course, is necessary to keep the Intel Core i7 and the NVidia RTX 3060 cool and churning reducing throttling.The cooling system does a very good job keeping the airflow going and it does even better job at cooling if the laptop is raised a couple of millimeters.There isn't much to do in the BIOS, beside disabling the intro sound.Acer does a very good job with the Predator Helios 300 performance and excellent pricing. The laptop is very responsive and it can handle most games above 60 fps on high settings. It has good build quality and the screen is even better than described.It will be hard to find anything better at this price point and down the road you could upgrade RAM and M.2 SSD to keep up with never ending tech evolution.The screen felt a bit flimsy, since it has a flexes a bit more than I would have liked.

"(Great laptop for the price. But issues with the bezel/ frame): I received the laptop in perfect condition. So far I've had no issues with performance, and reliability. It's really a nice bang for the buck gaming laptop. Just watch out for potential issues with the screen's bezel/frame adhesive, as I found that in my case, it's not correctly holding the bezel to the screen, creating a noticeable gap that's not present in the rest of the bezel. If I continue to find simple quality issues like this, I'm afraid I won't be buying any more Lenovo products in the future.",0
"(Perfectly Suited for Casual Users): Acer continues to make a great product at a great price.

"(Received a used, very damaged computer even though the description said “New.”): Run, don’t walk, away from this product.

Immediately returned and 2 weeks later have not received a refund or even been told if they’ve received the computer.",0
(Fast): My son loves this computer. It has so much Room to add on. You can add a hard drive and you can add more memory and it is extremely fast and the processor will keep up with the additions.,0

"(Excellent machine.): I mostly play grand strategy games (heavy on CPU) and some Minecraft (256 packs with shaders). This machine easily handles those games.As for higher graphics games, they all handle quite well at medium to high graphic settings though I haven't done much testing. (Tested with multiple games but only for probably 10-20 minutes each for review purposes)If you are going to use this for work and play having a big screen and number pad is a huge plus. This computer does have a 'gaming' laptop look, so if you are not dual purposing the machine I would look elsewhere.Fit and finish was excellent, only issue being the enter key on the number pad being slightly sticky on arrival.As for overheating others mentioned, I have had absolutely 0 issues with this. I use a cooling pad at home but not when I visit friends (gaming) or at work (non-intensive use).One thing I can't rate is battery life as I run on battery pretty much 0% of the time, sorry about that. (Gaming on battery will suck the battery in 1-2 hours regardless of machine while also decreasing performance)",0
I don’t love that the power connection is on the side of the device.,0
(Screen resolution could be better but works well): I got this for my mother in law and she could not be happier with how it works. I was hoping the screen resolution would be better but I guess at this price you can only expect so much.,0
"(I would have given this 5-stars except Apple ID is causing me fits.): This the second Apple laptop I have used. Back in 2002, I rescued a powerbook 145 someone was going throw out. It was a sweet machine. This Air is super sweet, easy to use, fast, light and with good battery life. I would give it 5 stars, if getting Apple ID setup has turned into a nightmare. Get it. The computer is great. Apple ID ... not so much.",0
"(Great, but a Little Slow): Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. The audio is great in my opinion, and the laptop is sleek and a good weight and size. The screen is clear and bright as well. The battery life is also great; I have been using it on and off for a few days on a single charge. Since I needed a laptop for college, battery life was my priority. The only downside is that it does seem a tad bit slow consistently, especially if there are more than a few tabs open.",0
(It’s good but uses storage to fast): Uses storage tooooo fast,0

"(Don't buy acer, ports all go out instantly): My last laptop was a similar model, it was old and had a lot of problems including none of the ports working. I bought this one assuming the issues were due to the age of the computer. I have not even had this thing a year yet and the ports all don't work. Why can't they make computers where the ports actually work. Cant use a mouse anymore at all.",0
"(Great value and an excellent alternative to a MacBook if budget is limited.): Excellent value even with import tax, very fast, light and great quality. You will need a 2 to 3 pin adaptor for the UK and of course it’s got a US keyboard layout but that’s not really a problem.",0
(Eh not sure what to put here lol): This thing at 100% will maybe..... maybe last you 2 hours even with power save mode on atleast when I used it it did.Other then the battery life sucking majorly it wasn't that bad had pretty good quality and everything.,0
"(Looks as presented EXCEPT the HDD is 299GB instead of 500GB): Though the laptop is a steal at that price, there are compromises. The disk space is lower than what was advertised, there is no USB3.0 port, the battery seems to have been removed and replaced, and the general aesthetic does not exactly look new. Either way, it works. I guess you get what you pay for.",0
(Second one and it broke too): Purchased April of this year and it’s Sept it quit working last night. If I could give zero stars I would.,0

"(Plastic beveling peeling off): Within a month, the plastic beveling around the screen started to peel off/unattach. I called ASUS support who are the absolute worst. Albeit, all computer customer services are terrible except for Apple. ASUS wanted me to ship back my laptop, at my expense, and wait 4 weeks to get it back. No thanks. Fortunately amazon is letting me return this. Way too dangerous to keep this laptop for the long term and see what other issues arise. Wirecutter needs to update their reviews and remove this cheaply made laptop. Go for Dell XPS 13 insteadBUYER BEWARE",0
"(By Far Best 'Mid-Tier' gaming/production laptop): For reference I got 16gb RAM, RTX 3060, i7-12650h.About me:I am a programmer and gamer, who was very hesitant to switch from desktop to laptop given the amount of time I spend on a computer. Recently at work I got switched to a MacBook pro and a thunderbolt docking station and that has been revolutionary for me. Since this laptop can plug right into my dock I finally felt comfortable to take the leap. And I am very pleasantly surprised! Only a few weeks into ownership and I am not only growing fond of this little machine but I even was able to sell my desktop and JUST use this.Laptop itself:Fast. Great at multitasking. Never runs out of juice with 10 cores. I can game, and review code simultaneously.It does run a bit warm when gaming though. Especially the CPU. I personally found turning off turbo via throttle stop to be the best solution and it didn't hit my game quality at all, running 50-70°c during 6 hour game sessions. Otherwise, I'd still recommend a cooling pad and limit fps. Before turning boost off, and repasting, it was running 75-100°c (thermal throttle). After repaste it runs 70-90°c normally during gaming PCGaming:Pretty much any game on high to ultra settings, 1080 or 1440p and 60fps is a breeze for this thing. I play far cry 5, halo infinite, Forza horizon 5, etcWiFi is blazing fast. I'm pulling 340mbps download in steam which is what I got on my wired PC.Screen is decent. Looks good but could be Brighter. The big con of any laptop under $2-2500. But it's brighter than my previous msi laptop so I'm happyBattery is good for what it is. ~4-5 hours web browsing or YouTube, 1-1.5 gaming depending on settings but charges lighting fast.Overall very thin, very light, very good looking laptop and the build qaulity feels great. With a dock it truly becomes a portable workstation",0
(Unplayable input lag even with great internet connected by ethernet.): Big waste of money.,0
"(Frequently won't shutdown): This product is basically okay but has one major problem in you can't remove the battery easily to do a hard shutdown. In frequent occasions I haven't been able to shut it down. This seems to be a known Windows 11 problem. I have run the power troubleshoot several times to be informed there isn't a problem but it still won't shutdown. With Acer laptops in the past I simply have removed the battery to do a hard shutdown to resolve things. With this model that appears to require taking it apart. It's a toss up who to find at fault, Microsoft or Acer.",0
"(DO NOT BUY): It should have been a sign when I first bought it and the sound was quiet, the screen was naturally dark, and the battery life was seriously 2 hours. Couldn’t even make it through all my zoom classes without being plugged in.Here I am, 11 months later, and the mouse pad stopped working WHILE I WAS USING IT!! I didn’t think much about it and thought it would just go away, two months later, it still has not. Just today I noticed my touch to get in stopped working, so I finally called tech-support thinking they would help me and either offer a refund because I’m within a year, or tell me the location of a place I can bring my computer to get it fixed. Nope. It took over half an hour for them just to tell me that it’ll cost me $80 for them to try to do something that may not even work. Definitely not worth the money, go put it towards something more reliable. So disappointed.",0
I have a single pixel that is a bright green all the time,0
"(Trash due to Powershell and S-mode): Microsoft gets worse every year. S-mode is a massive problem and is a virus. Why do I say it is a virus? Well, because it doesn't count as a verified Microsoft App! The stupid thing started to run itself on startup, triggering S-mode, and then freezing on the warning window pop-up...rendering the laptop entirely useless. People shouldn't have to deal with this sort of absurd incompatibility issues right out of the damn box.",0

(good quality): it works really well! the screen quality is very good and clear. I’ve been doing schoolwork on mine and it allows me to do things my other computer will not. overall a very beautiful laptop and great purchase! would recommend!!,0
"(Very smart purchase for a student.): Was a bit of a hassle setting up a color profile to change the yellowness in the screen, but it ended up looking just fine. Really good at managing a large load of tasks at once. Battery life is a bit short.",0
"(Constant screen flickering): The laptop was faulty with constant screen flickering, despite updating to the latest drivers/Windows updates/BIOS, etc. There was no damage to the packaging or the laptop itself.",0
(Worst purchase ever.): Worst product I have ever bought off amazon. Couldn’t load a webpage. Do not buy.,0
(Terrible!): The keyboard broke with in a month and now the sound went out! I’ve it two months!,0
"(love): I love this laptop! If you're getting the gold - note that it still looks silver, depending on the light it looks gold. I was a little disappointed when I received it because I expected it to look a lot more gold. It's still cute though. It is extremely lightweight which is nice and the battery lasts pretty long!",0
"(Good quality laptop computer!): My laptop arrived quickly and in great condition! I mostly use it for work, but have used it for some older games and it works well. I do not think it is powerful enough for true gamers.",0
the screen hinge that raises the back for more air,0
"(Great little laptop!): This Macbook is definitely great for users who want lots of power and versatility, but don't want to break the bank. It is very lightweight and sleek.The color (gold) is also very pretty, but keep in mind that it is more of a pinkish gold than a yellow gold. However, the camera quality is not great for such an otherwise powerful laptop. Especially in this era of zooming and FaceTiming, a good camera is essential in a laptop. It's not terrible, but its not great either. Another thing - the front lid of the MacBook got a couple of scratches very easily. I was able to get them off, but I would suggest getting a good quality case to ensure that this doesn't happen. All in all I would rate this Macbook a 4.5/5! Definitely lived up to the hype!",0
(Don’t buy): Ass,0
"(Decent laptop): I deem it as a budgetary gaming laptop since it only has an Intel i3 CPU and 8GB ram. It is definitely not for big 3A games which will require higher configuration. But for normal business use and small games, it is good enough.",0
(Seller swore it had a Cardbus slot. It does NOT.): Good laptop overall. However seller lied about it having a CardBus slot. Which is the only reason I bought it.,0
(Muy buena): Excelente calidad buen rendimiento,0
(Excelente equipo): Pequeña y muy maniobrable,0
"(Great laptop): This gaming computer has everything I need. Was easy to set up out the box, plugged all my accessories in without an issue. Only downfall is battery does not last very long off wall charger but I don't intend to use it that long on battery level.",0
it has a beautiful black shell/casing that looks amazing,0
"(Backlight bleeding): Unfortunately my laptop's screen came with backlight bleeding, so I asked Amazon for a replacement unit.Other than than, the laptop is fantastic, very quiet and powerful with nice temperatures.As a negative point, the laptop does not have a mux switch so it is not possible to deactivate optimus. This point is no longer important if you are playing on a gaming monitor or an HDTV. You can play Doom Eternal at native 4K with all the graphic settings in ultra at 60 fps, or even more if your HDTV is 120hz. You can also play Cyberpunk 2077 in 4K using DLSS and a mix of medium and high settings.But playing at 1080p on the 240hz screen is overall the best gaming experience you will have.",0
(Worst laptop ever!!): Ever since I've had it and that's not long I've had nothing but problems with wifi connection and downloading anything and now I've reset it and can't get anything to download on it al all. I should have sent it back right after I got it and I guess it's too late now. I got totally ripped off and need another laptop now. I shouldn't have tried to go cheap. You get what you pay for.,0
"(Three Stars): nice little gaming laptop but the screen seems flat , washed out a bit for an ips.",0
"(Battery is 90 watt hours and I am impressed, amazing build quality!): Runs like a laptop with an RTX 3070 should run. Screen looks great and everything I’ve ran on it functions super well. The ability to change graphic profiles and turn the cooling system up or down on the fly is awesome. Thanks MSI for making another amazing product!",0
"(Great Chromebook): I'm very pleased with the quality of this Chromebook. Fortunately I haven't had any issues staying connected to wifi as others have had mentioned in their reviews. My biggest concern was going from a Windows OS to a Chrome OS, but it wasn't a difficult transition at all. I'm still able to use Microsoft Word through the Word Online app as I use Word for many things. I recommend this Chromebook to anyone who needs a simple laptop to search the internet, watch movies, listen to music or homework.",0
"(Chrome operating system): Nice little labtop for everyday use. Got it for my wife, I prefer something a little bigger (that delete button is important to me lol).Really efficient machine",0
(Bad battery): Great specs and well built but laptop life is around an hour with just google chrome running (writing an essay). If you don’t mind staying plugged it it’s fine.,0
(The network connection malfunctioned a week into owning it and I had to send it back.): Reasonable computer for a good deal.,0
(Laptop locked up on set up.): Laptop locked up while setting up.,0
The aesthetics of the laptop also make it very appealing.,0
(high quality and high performance): A powerful CPU and remarkable 16GB DDR5 RAM! You can expect all tasks to be well performed with this laptop. I really liked the design of the laptop and the big enough touchpad!for simple tasks the cpu speed is under 2.0GHz which leads to a better battery performance! Thanks to ASUS. and don't forget to leave a comment to receive your 90 day warranty extension!,0
"(Excelente producto): Tengo q admitir que al principio no estaba convencida del todo con esta laptop… pero a superado mis espectativas es súper rápida, la batería dura casi dos días. En tama?o pensé q se vería muy grande ya q tenía una de 14” pero la verdad es q casi no e sentido la diferencia el teclado retro iluminado funciona a la perfección cuando estamos en una área no muy clara… en fin creo q es una d ellas mejores compras q e realizado en Laptos 100% recomendada",0
"(It worked in my network,): Excellent product. Unpacked it, plugged it in and it worked perfectly. Battery charged quickly.",0
(Thé laptop is not good at all): I don’t like it my mouse does not working I can’t fixe it no capacity,0
"(Very good laptop): It works very well for gaming and browsing the web! The OLED screen looks great. I also like the fingerprint sensor, which isn't mentioned in the product description. Only slight issue I had is that the ""w"" key occasionally stops working.I am also recieving a 90 day warranty extension by doing this review from ASUS.",0
"(instructions): Would have preferred setup instructions in paper form also, so I could have been more prepared at set up.",0
"(prone to scratches:(): First off, I would like to say this product is amazing!! I love how fast it is and how synced it is with my iPhone. I recommend for college student because everything I need for school I can access on my laptop. The laptop itself and its speed is perfect. My only issue, and why I reviewed it for 4 stars, is in my first couple days of using it, it already scratched. I am very careful with it, so when I discovered a scratch that will not come off, I was very disappointed. I tried using toothpaste and water to get it off, but it has not done the trick. So please be careful when you buy this product, because like I said, it gets scratches very easily and they do not come off. Recommend getting a case before getting it or right after purchasing it!",0
(Three Stars): it works ok never got warranty,0
"(Awesome laptop for the price): This laptop is, to use the professional term, ""the tits"". Outstanding specs for the price point, and easily upgraded (extra m.2 slot and ram are easily accessible) been running everything I play at max settings without any issues.",0
(Quality is poor): Little less than 2 years and one of the hinges breaks causing the screen to crack.,0
"(Great buy.): I bought this to replace a 2015 MacBook Pro, and it’s worked out great. Better screen and better battery life. Much faster processor. Also much thinner and lighter yet I can use my existing laptop sleeve. Happy with this.",0
"(Does the job, battery sucks...): So far, this computer has been able to tackle everything I have needed it to. As an architecture student, I need a lot of processing power and a decent screen - this computer fills both needs well. I switched over from a 2011 Macbook Pro and although Windows is not my favorite the processing power is what I needed to use programs like Revit, AutoCAD, and Sketchup.A couple things which are just negligent on my part but good to reiterate - this laptop does NOT have a DVD drive, also the screen is not as nice as the Macbook pro.Also - the battery sucks a lot (after a few months of use, I'm regretting this purchase)",0
(Amazing fast international delivery): Trusted seller. Amazing product and I just love the laptop. I absolutely love it,0
(Nice product because it is very quiet):,0
(Perfecto): Perfecta,0
"(I like pc/laptops, I also really like gaming): I like pc/laptops, I also really like gaming, smash those together and it creates this. I really like this laptop, It gets the job done!",0
"(GREAT LAPTOP FOR HOME): I have been using this laptop for a month and some change which I tried video editing, graphic design, and gaming.Surprisingly performed well for games like Control, Alan Wake, Valorant, Gears 5, A Plagues Tale, & recently The Medium (side not The Medium was on High).I have not experience any lagging but the track pad sometime doesn't follow so I just got a mouse.The battery is about a few hours with little performance things but demanding things definitely require the charger.The keyboard has a backlit function which is a plusLimited on usb ports but you can get a hub to add more.The webcam is ok.There were times the laptop felt a little hot but to be on the safe side I got a cooling pad and only using full performance when doing demanding work.The final thing that is a drawback if your gaming/video editing and NEVER like to manage space, the storage is pretty small when you consider game sizes and video sizes. So I would recommend getting an External HDD with a few TB to save money but if you got money to spare and speed is a big thing to you....External SSD with at least 2 TB.Overall I highly recommend this laptop if your trying to get into mid- demanding work like video editing at 1080p (havent tried 4k). Look at reviews on YouTube, they go into further detail. I've attached a little video I edited of Alan Wake.At this moment in time, I have a gaming mouse, a gaming headset, a cooling pad, a usb hub, a drawing tablet, affinity designer, xbox gaming, steam, unity, and wondershare filmora, with a few games, and an external hdd....still no problems have occurred. It would be a full 5 star if the battery and storage were a bit more but still worth every penny.",0
(Nice.): Works great.,0
"(GreatComputer, but be warned ....): Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip. A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1. my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2. my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad). If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa. Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET. THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!",0
"(Bricked): I'm not giving a poor review for the laptop.I'm giving a poor review AmazonThe warehouse deal was legit though the previous user did not reset or restore the device. Password locked. Microsoft, Asus or Amazon could not help.This was an amazing verified product. Not the case.Please Amazon check before shipping out a produxt that's essentially bricked.",0
(So easy): Love it! Laptop/shmaptop. I wish I'd went Chromebook a long time ago!,0
"(llego en buen estado, funciona bien, i like it, chequen bien las especificaciones antes de comprar.): contratiempos por el envió, nunca me habían pedido una contrase?a de uso único (OTP), Aparte de eso no tiene puerto ethernet, error mío por no revisar bien las especificaciones, pero con un adaptador debería ir bien.",0
"(Good price-performance ratio): + I bought this product, because it was far better than any in my country in this price range. Even with taxes and shipping.+ The screen is exceptional compared to my previous Asus ROG. It's used for gaming with graphic intense game and so far it does it's job well. With a little tweak, I can keep the temperatures below 70°C.- The battery life could be better and the battery is not removable without taking the laptop apart.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and I want to spend lots of hours with this beauty.",0
"(Overall a great laptop (still using after 4 years)): I really use this laptop for personal use and for casual gaming (POE, Paladins, ex-Overwatch) and it holds up well in the graphics sector but the video card is soldered to the CPU so it’s impossible to upgrade graphics. It’s sporting a intel UHD 620 and that’s in the low average range compared to other laptops with similar specs. It’s an overall GREAT laptop for the price. I actually recommend Asus over Dell or HP as I’ve had no issues internally with the device so far. It’s light and the metal material makes it very sturdy/durable. You can be active and use it with one hand.The laptop is a bit small so I recommend getting a desk so you won’t feel so cramped. The keyboard is small but not everyone has hulk fingers, I like how close the keys are and it’s backlit too.",0
(Don’t do it): I had so many problems with this laptop. First of all the speakers are terrible but that wasn’t the worst thing. My laptop was so faulty. Keyboard wouldn’t work half the time & when it did work it would only type in reverse. It’s cheap for a reason. Pick a better laptop.,0
"(Great computer; only complaint is the touchpad): I got this computer for college, and it is perfect for me. The only problem is the touchpad is very touchy. Other than that I am very happy I made this purchase.",0
(Machine is not good): Cooling is terrible. Don’t let the aeroblade bs fool you. Don’t buy this unless you want an expensive way to cook an omelet. Build a pc,0
(Five Stars): This chrome book is very good everything works when you get it. I suggest people to get it.,0
(Love it): I love it. Exactly what I ordered. All my expectations were met and more.,0
(Good value): Good for my work,0
(Not as advertised): Not fully screen or open battery even... slow ssd... not impressed..,0
"(Screen display is crooked, otherwise solid laptop): I bought this ZenBook UX331UA-DS71 to replace my much-loved ZenBook UX330UA from late 2015, hoping for an upgraded version of the same laptop. Overall, there have been many improvements, but I'm returning it because the screen is noticeably crooked and uncentered relative to the edges of the display, and part of the screen actually goes off the display (see three attached photos). In the photo of the blue setup screen, the bottom right corner has a wide and angled offset from the screen edge, something that can't be seen at either of the top corners, where the blue goes all the way up to and beyond the screen edge. The slanted display orientation can be seen somewhat in the setup screen, but is much more noticeable with Microsoft Word (second picture), Chrome (third picture), or any application with context menus or tabs that extend to the top left corner of the screen, where they are clearly cut off by the edge of the display. The third picture also shows a screenshot of that screen pasted to MS Paint, where there is no slant.Pros:Great look and feel -- lightweight, and the icicle gold is actually more of a silver color with a slight golden tint that is barely noticeableGreat price for the hardware -- for a 256 GB SSD, latest Intel 8th gen quad core i7-8550U processor, and excellent battery life, this laptop is definitely a bargain, and unique in its niche price point/hardware combination compared to the Lenovo Yoga series, Dell XPS 13, Microsoft Surface series, and the latest MacBook Air. The computer boots in less than 10 seconds and runs very fast with this processor/SSD combination.Several improvements over the ZenBook UX330UA: speakers are louder, trackpad is less noisy and ""clacky"", and the keyboard is now elevated above the laptop surface rather than in a slightly depressed section that easily accumulates dust and debris. It also appears to have fixed the issue of occasional random crashes when the UX330UA tries to sleep, an issue that caused me to return and replace the UX330UA three times through Amazon before accepting that this was probably just an issue for every computer of this model (though at this point I haven't used this UX331UA enough to say for sure that it's fixed).Backlit keyboard and fingerprint reader are nice feature additionsCons:Display is crooked (see above). This is my main reason for returning this laptop.The top of the laptop is a shiny material that attracts and retains smudgesTrackpad has some issues. At times it seems to have a lag before the cursor moves, and this doesn't seem to correlate with CPU load.The laptop runs a little hot sometimes, even when I'm only doing medium-load tasks like editing graphics in Illustrator or doing spreadsheet work. With the UX330UA, I never felt much heat even when the fan was running at full speed.Overall: great laptop with a few very minor issues that won't be dealbreakers for the average user; great value for a portable machine that will last all day!",0
"(Reliable): Good battery,boots up fast,good product for the price.",0
"(Love it. It's great.): It's great. Ordered on 9/09 and arrived on 9/11. RTX 2070 is flawless. CPU is flawless. Cooling is sufficient but I haven't given it a hard push on everything with the highest settings. Screen is nice. Keyboard is pretty rad. Sound is better than expected. MSI registration was simple and setup up everything was a breeze. One thing to keep in mind is the power supply is big and heavy, but that's to be expected with a full RTX 2070 in here. So, this may affect portability a bit. Not an issue for me as this is now my main gaming rig and it handles everything.",0
"(Good Price, no frills, just what we needed): Perfect for my daughter in high school / college classes. Didn't break the bank and does its job.",0
the power button is a little bit too easy to press,0
(The Price Is Right): Bought this for my son for high school since they decided to have the students being their own device. He really likes it and it's lightweight. A good buy for the price on a short notice.,0
(Great speed and performance): I absolutely love my new Asus. I bought it for personal every day use. It's memory and processor alone were the key factors in making the decision to buy this laptop.,0
Super thin and light weight and plays all the games I play with ease.,0
"(DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!): Product did not come with the correct charger, product does not have windows 10 installed and ready to go.WASTE OF MONEY! Customer service will not ever answer your phone call or return the phone call!",0
(Good PC but annoying pop up from McAfee): so far I like this laptop except for McAfee's pop up that keeps coming up even though I didn't order their software. Very annoying and so far I haven't been able to delete it.,0
(Good laptop other than the constant freezing.): When it arrived it already had issues of freezing for no reason.,0
(Excellent value!): Perfect for my 10 year old. I find the keyboard hard to use because of its smaller size and my hands are large. We have had it for 3 months and it's excellent for researching. They use Google drive at school so this is perfect. Excellent value for what we need at home.,0
(Love it!): Shipping was fast and laptop doing my work faster. Highly recommend!,0
"(Disaster of a product): After 4 months the screen stopped working. Amazon told me over and again to reboot, despite me telling them what the problem is.They then passed me to Acer, who told me that somehow the screen is not covered by the warrantee, and that I was free to spend $154 to fix their junky $200 computer.I strongly advise not to buy this unless you want to be very frustrated and out $200.",0
"whenever you try to pick it up, there us a creaking sound of some kind",0
"(Handy for Internet usage): For faster internet usage this is the thing. It doesn't have a zillion apps included as a regular laptop does and doesn't have all the complex stuff needed to run those zillion apps. It has 2 usb ports so you can run a wireless mouse and have a device (phone, camera, etc) at the same time. I'm not tech savvy so I printed the user guide and it has helped me a lot. The most frustrating thing with this is getting it to print. I tried many different things and finally called Samsung, she was no help she told me to call my printer company. I kept looking around for help and finally go it going.",0
(Touchscreen doesn’t work): This computer is not compatible with windows 10. The touchscreen stopped working.,0
"(Too slow, almost entirely browser-based.): I bought this Chromebook as I thought it would be a helpful tool for taking notes and doing work away from my desktop computer, but I was exceedingly wrong. The Chromebook is more hassle than help, being incredibly slow and even occasionally freezing up for ~5 seconds when I am using Microsoft word from the browser.It also does not help that the Chromebook loses most of its convenience and utility without internet, not being able to access Google Drive and having limited use from installed apps.The only thing it does well is in having a small size, but even then the keyboard seems stretched horizontally and squished vertically so it can feel slightly off to type. That does not include the fact that the keys have to be pressed all the way down in order to type a character, so that makes typing lines of text a hassle with various misspellings of words throughout.",0
it didn't seem that the speaker volume was as loud as I have heard on some laptops in the past,0
"(Don't count on Amazon support team): Guy, Don't buy anything that is related to Apple product that past 30 days from Amazon cuz you cannot return nor exchange it. ie. If the item is required for Apple Tech Support or troubleshoot and For some reason Apple Tech cannot resolve the issue. You are dead in the water. Amazon will not support you what so ever. You have to pick your brain and try to figure it out yourself. I bought an MacBook Air and having an issue with activation and neither Apple Tech or Amazon support can resolve it. I've to google it and resolve it myself. Good Luck.",0
(Very nice): Nice laptop. Runs well after the updates. My only complaint is the win updates took over four hours. That's with a good internet connection.,0
Not only does it make it feel very well made and premium (especially for the cost!) but it also allows CHUWI to avoid using fans on this laptop,0
"(Me encantó, y llegó el mismo día):",0
(Problem computer): Much lower than an optimal gaming laptop in my opinion. I had nothing but issues with this from the moment I got it. Returned after two weeks. Bought a different machine and it worked perfectly out of the box. Definitely spend the extra money for something more reliable.,0
"(Drowning In A Sea Of Love Over My New CB5-571 Acer Chromebook 15): This CB5-571-C910 15 inch 4 gigs of ram is a dream to use. The speakers produce clear and quality sound waves and the volume is ample...loud really which is what I wanted. When I play some of my favorite songs, I go into a dream.The speed of the internet reception seems strong and the display is quite clear...I have had the computer for two weeks now and using it is a joy.I bought two 11 inch Acer Chromebooks 3 years ago and was more than pleased by their performance. The speed of the bootup and the speed on the internet converted me from windows in 15 minutes.One of the better decisions in my life was to buy this computer...I am in my 60s so have a lot to compare it with.",0
"(Great value for the money): Look, I'll update this if I start to have issues with the thing, but after all of the windows updates etc... This thing is a beast. I think it out games my Xbox Series X and dang, that thing is fast. If you're an Xbox enthusiast and you have game pass for PC or game pass ultimate make sure you go to windows update and get every single update. Check then recheck. My only criticism is that this thing runs hot (duh) when stressed, but if you get a quality laptop cooler to combat this it's no issue. Very satisfied with my purchase!",0
(Good price): Great for the price,0
There are stains on the keyboard that is fused into the plastic.,0
(No windows 10 supplied): I like the brand name dislike the size and no windows 10 or dvd player.,0
"(Which RAM stick could work on this laptop?): I tried two different types of DDR4 sticks to expand the memory and both failed. It can't boot after installed it, no any display even the logo... pls help advice.",0
"(Most horrible computer I've ever owned): The computer worked great for about 2 months, albeit loud and overheating...it still played the games well enough. However, the battery went out after that, and the computer wouldn't even work when plugged in. It would shut down in the middle of gaming. Acer was no help, and now the Turbo has stopped working.",0
(Box it comes in is basic): I only just opened the box. I am still using it. Key board is a bit different then I am used to and the box it comes in is surprisingly basic - expected something more along the lines of the graphics card boxes. Otherwise so good so far. It did freeze one me once already. But so far I am happy with it.,0
(Five Stars): I got this laptop for my wife and I got to say she loves it. Plays guild wars 2 nicely.,0
I was looking for a lightweight laptop that is good for gaming.,0
(I love it!): It came in perfect condition and it's a great laptop!,0
"(Great product for all users, but note the concerns for gaming and productivity.): Adding photos later, but here is my initial review.Unboxing, super easy and secure.Gaming runs smooth for low res since I mainly game on ps4, but for designing, these are the concerns.AutoCAD - efficient and no issues except large 3D architecture structures give some lag when rendering. Easy fix with larger SSD and 8gb more ram most likely for these issues.AutoDesk Maya - Rigs are smooth to place in Morrison Builder without lag, but the special effects of rain, snow, ice and such that I've coded and composed still gives lag. It doesn't freeze entirely like my old PC did. Turbo ran it efficiently for the testing that I needed at least.Photoshop - lags with brush sizes larger than 50pt. The display is purely impressive for me to customize 8K pictures. Very nice colour, tone and depth in the visual display. Also antiglare.Sony Soundforge - Does not have bass. Needs a sub or use bluetooth( not told in details about) to sync up a sub speaker or the aux port( mic port available too).Sony Vegas Pro - Converting Camtasia files and editing takes not too long for 1080p. A 4 hour stream I clipped to 12 minutes only took maybe 35 minutes to go to the highlights and editing and a 4-ten minute to finalize and convert.OBS - So, some of these may be because of the bandwidth for streaming. Currently the stream played flawless for my Intro, AFK Screen and Outro. During the stream, there was some latency issues with mic and video not syncing, but no issues with the black screen or pixelation.Gamers.Runescape and League of Legends run flawless on max settings.Perfect World, Forsaken world, Shaiya, Rusty Hearts, NeverWinter are at 60fps+ at 73% of settings maxed.Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft, EVE and Dead by Daylight Run 60fps+ at 45-53% Of settings maxed.Fortnite, Darwin Project, PubG, Paladins Battlegrounds, H1Z1 and Ark all ran at max settings at 30fps+ without dropping. If moving to 60fps, I'd recommend upgrading ram and install on SSD instead of HDD, Wired (LAN), increasing RAM. At that point it should run close to 60fps flawless. I would recommend running these at minimum except distance for best results of competitive play.Now for the Housing.Compact, medium weight, finger print prone, dust magnet-not, easy to clean, upgrade, downgrade, and integrated with the following.Rj45 port,3.5mm jacks(2), 1 HDMI port, 1 port that I think is a female type C?, USB 3.0(2) USB 2.0(1). With MSI motherboards you can overclock the CPU, GPU, HDD Data transfers and USB ports.",0
"(It's not a good computer): What I don't like is that every few months there's an update which crashes my computer. Up until now I fixed it with recover. At this point, 6 months in, it is totally crashed with a stop code. I'm trying to get support but the serial number are these tiny numbers on the motherboard which don't distinguish between 0 and 0. I am so disappointed in this product!",0
(Five Stars): Great product.,0
"(Keyboard takes a little getting used to.): The speed is great. It is light and does everything I need. The missing delete, home, end and other keys means that I have to work a little differently, but not much.",0
(Good Computer): Bought this for my husband. He really likes it. Much faster than his old computer and it doesn't freeze like the old one did. He is very pleased with it.,0
"(Excelente rendimiento en gráficos): Es un excelente equipo, cumplió totalmente las expectativas para el uso que se buscaba (modelado 3d, renderizado y animación), en cuanto a la entrega llegó incluso antes de lo esperado.Producto 100% recomendado.",0
"(some bloatware and issues with dragon center and keys wearing off fast but otherwise good): I've had this now for 9 months and a few months ago I noticed some key etching was wearing off. That's pretty sad. The MSI Dragon Center won't let you change profiles unless you update, but doesn't notify you of an update. They shouldn't restrict functionality of the program which is already installed unless you install an update to that program. That's ridiculous. If I want to turn on super battery I shouldn't have to figure out that an update is required, close the program, update it and restart the computer. I should be able to use this functionality at any time I choose.For the most part though, it's been a fine laptop. It was tough finding one which fit the needs that I have and I rarely even use this for gaming but I wanted something powerful enough that I wouldn't see it getting bogged down from more demanding video streams like 4k 60 fps, etc...And I wanted a really good screen and above average keyboard. I don't like 60 Hz refresh rate as it's noticeably slow eve non desktop use once you are so used to high refresh rate on your main system.The colors are very appealing on the screen as well.The only thing is, this being my first laptop I sometimes wish that I had gotten a lighter one with a larger screen and higher resolution because I often miss having all that space that I have on my 27"" 1440p screens.",0
"(Buena compra y buen servicio en genral, llego antes de lo se?alado y si alguna dificultad.): Precio excelente para un equipo de primera",0
(Professional laptop!! good good good!!): Very fast speed!! It's a great laptop for 3D designers!!! Love it!!,0
(APPLE MACBOOK): My first new Apple product. Very fast and now I am in learning mode. Buy this unit.,0
"The plug has bright blue light that never goes off. It is nice to be able to find the plug, but it never shuts off and it is so bright, not something I would want to keep in my bedroom. It is a mild annoyance.",0
(Laptop is OK but Speakers not good): The speakers came in messed up. Sound when playing music or movie is always cracked and this is not something that can easily be fixed without removing the case. 🤦‍♂️,0
"(Inadequate): I bought this computer after returning a cheaper HP laptop. But this low end laptop is still to low for me to recommend it. It appears to start up quickly, but it takes forever to be ready to display anything complicated (like a photo accompanying an email). It basically is very dim-witted. It responds slowly. It drops entire web pages. It does not reach the level of a sturdy simple computer, which is what I need. The battery life is much better than my old Dell laptop, and it is light weight. Those are the only reasons I ever carry this laptop. For anything serious, I use my ancient Dell.",0
(Not working out of the box. Used?): Not working as turned on. Returned for refund. Shipping was not refunded. Not happy !!,0
"(Great.): Great machine, arrive fast and easy. Never a problem with latest games. I love it.",0
(WHEA Hardware Uncorrectable Error One Week After Warranty): This was a great laptop until it started getting hardware blue screens literally the week after the support/warranty expired. Now it won't turn on at all. Narrowed down to either the processor or graphics card faulty. Such a shame because it did run well and I was recommending Acer to friends before it went belly up.,0
"(Good for a chrome box): Good price and decent support, but you need to be ready for the stripped down unit compared to your pc or mac you had before.",0
"I’m terms of fans, the laptop is the loudest I’ve heard",0
"(Recomendado): Exactamente igual a lo que se describe , ya la tengo 8 meses y no me ha dado problemas",0
(Beware of Asus): Try to call asus customer service before buying asus products. I waited like 3 hours and still couldn't connect. Their laptops are very bad. Mine broke in 13 months. They asked $2k for a motherboard replacement.,0
Armoury Crate software took a few minutes to get acclimated with to adjust the lighting effects and color for the RGB keyboard.,0
"(This is the actual Dell listing): Was trying to purchase this laptop but multiple listings appeared. FYI, the other listings are from third-party sellers or distributors. Nothing wrong with third-party sellers and if you want to purchase from a third-party seller that is up to you. If you try to go to other listings and go under the ""Buy Now"" buttons, third-party sellers will have a section that says ""ships from/sold by"". This listing does not, so it is sold by the actual Dell store. Also, if you can, buy this laptop when it has a discount. I bought it at an unfortunate time and the price dropped $200 after it shipped. I was able to return it and repurchase with the discount.",0
"(GOOD LAPTOP): A lot of these reviews talk about the low refresh rate and how it’s was advertised to be 144hz. The refresh Rate 60hz, but on valorant I had a solid 300 FPS on high graphic settings. I would read the other reviews before buying but so far the laptop is running great and is built very well, and is VERY PRETTY. This is also my first gaming laptop so I wouldn’t know the best, but if you are looking for a well-built medium price laptop, this is for you. The battery life is pretty bad if you pay on the high performance mode but you can easily change to battery mode or in between both on the MSI Dragon center, or/and from the windows control center.",0
(Great product.): Great product. Fast and easy to use.,0
"(Faulty Sleep Function): There are many great things about this machine. It's lightweight, with good battery life, and a super quick boot time. However, it has a regularly recurring sleep mode error which necessitates a force shutdown. This happens once every few days, and is a huge hassle for everyday functionality.",0
"(Great overall. Cons are battery(duh) and mine has mic jack static): A couple of months into use and this laptop is great overall. Other than some really minor issues with the software, the biggest cons I have experienced so far are with the hardware. First, the battery is pretty bad. It only lasts about 4 hours if you aren't pushing the laptop and it will last way less if you're doing anything like gaming or running more than 5 chrome tabs. Fortunately for me, I don't plan on moving this device around too much so I leave it near the charger. If you are expecting a better battery than this, good luck because either you pay way more money for a laptop with a better battery, or you buy this and deal with it because this is kind of the standard. Other than that expected fault, my unit came with some faulty ports. Specifically the USBs on the sides and the mic jack. The mic jack creates static noise through my headphones when plugged in and I know it's a hardware issue because having my hand on the chassis near the port silences the static meaning my hand is helping to ground the port. I haven't opened up the internals yet but I hope it's easily fixable. The USBs, especially the left one, are loose or something. Say I plug in a mouse-if I nudge the connector while in the port a bit, the mouse disconnects. The right USB does this less so I use that one. I haven't done any heavy gaming yet so I can't attest to its performance there yet, but so far the airflow during heavy usage seems good and the keyboard is very decent. Also, the webcam has a built-in manual slider to block/unblock it which was a cool bonus.",0
(SWEET TABLET PC): So overall have no complaints and this was replaceing a surface that had aged. Only complaints i have are the ram as someone else stated 16 gb is a little low would have much rather had 32gb ram and the ssd is not a common form factor which greatly limits what i can replace with other than those its not a deal breaker to me and love it,0
It is very snappy and the screen is great.,0
"(Great Laptop): My grandson uses this for school and gaming, it works nicely for his needs.",0
"(Good Quality): My Phone. My Car. My Acer Aspire 5. Those 3 things I use daily. I am a college student taking half of my classes online and this computer has yet to let me down. I have owned it for a little over 2 months and have seen more pros than cons. The ability to use zoom and microsoft word with it can be used extensively for schoolwork no matter the level.This is my first laptop of my own besides my high school providing us with chromebooks. They were Dell Intel Chromebook 3100 and all it did was get the job done which wasn’t in the most convenient ways. It was smaller and slower, and the difference between the two is impeccable. The quickness of the loading time and the fact it was very easy to get a hang of. As macbooks are seen as one of the best laptops in the market it is double the price at $1,000. It may not have all the specs of a macbook like connecting your iphone along to it, but it can definitely make up for it with the wireless connection being quick. This computer can also connect to an Xbox or a Samsung phone.This model is a slim build but is a little wider than a regular chromebook. If you are unsure what that could be relating to, think of a cutting board you may have in your kitchen. The elevated design of the computer for when you open it is very beneficial for when you are trying to relax and get schoolwork done without straining your neck when using it for a long time. As the elevation might not be a massive difference the half inch incline will come into effect when you least expect it and when you don’t even realize it.The battery runs a little quicker than I would like. To combat that I just have to remember to charge it overnight. Along with that sometimes the touchpad mouse drags a little bit. For example if I were clicking on a new tab sometimes it would drag the tab out and separate it from the others creating a new window. It gets really annoying when I’m trying to go back and forth between tabs for my classes and such. With a mouse I have found no problem in that area as it may be the touchpad being too sensitive. The laptop offers USB ports on each side so there won’t be an inconvenience with connecting a mouse.While this laptop is what I use for my schoolwork there have been no issues on that part. If you are looking to purchase a laptop for a reason other than school like gaming or something, this may not be the laptop for your needs. I have yet to do anything more extensive than schoolwork mainly using programs such as blackboard and launchpad. No issues there on my part.",0
"(DO NOT BUY A REFURB): Just buy the new one. I spent a total of 5 hours on the phone between Amazon's support like (they knew nothing), Microsoft (completely unhelpful) and HP (they knew a lot but couldn't fix the problem). Basically, the machine was convinced that the Windows software was illegitimate. It was a cascade of problems caused by how the software was downloaded onto the refurbished machine. I returned it and bought a new machine, and everything is working perfectly. Got it set up in 10 minutes. Do yourself a favor, and spend the few extra dollars.",0
"(Good value): A little slow at times but that may be my WiFi connection. For the price, it’s a pretty good laptop.",0
"(Trash): This computer is garbage. It's slow, it's cannot process. Cr2 photo files. It cannot process basic photoshop programs. It's slow, I have to restart it constantly, and the screen colors are off. Do not waste your money on this!",0
"(Arrived Broken, It Never Booted Up): We were never able to boot up the laptop. Customer support was frustrating. We returned the laptop.",0
(Love it's lightweight): Like,0
"(AMD wins again!): At the request of a relative, I decided to give the new AMD processors a try. Wow! This computer is so much faster than the Lenovo (with Intel) I just bought for my wife. May buy another one of these for the kids to play games and do homework on.",0
the battery life isn’t that great,0
"(Awesome deal no need to look any further!): For the money this is the best option available, I'll be useing it for gaming and video editing. The specs speak for themselves, there is power for days, I received this laptop early today And after about 6 hours of messing around playing a few games and different rendering softwares it's definitely proven itself to be an incredible asset. With the 6 core i7 alongside the 8gb ddr5 rtx 2070 there isn't much this isn't going to tackle!",0
"(Great for gaming and video editing!): Wow, this laptop after three months of use, is great and capable. Every game that ive installed on this, works at 1080p ultra and more than 60/144fps . I've used to make videos as well with 4K footage from a a6300 Sony camera, with da Vinci resolve, works amazing for this hard tasks. The keyboard is amazing, and even when you will encounter a plastic laptop, doesn't matter, because the construction seems sturdy enough. This one is for my girlfriend now, cus I've bought another msi, the pulse gl66 with a rtx3070. And overall they seems to be the same performance laptop!",0
(Came Quickly - Great Design - Super Fast - Lightweight - Great Price): I am really happy with my purchase and very impressed. To be fair I cant' rate battery life just yet as I just got it but by every other measure I don't expect to be disappointed. The keyboard feels great. The backlight isn't too obnoxious. The touchpad is appropriately responsive. It has good airflow... which is really important considering most age failures are a result of heat. If I had to say one bad thing it would be the process of registering the product through MSI because their server appears to be down. I'd really like to register this soon.,0
"(but i really like it know): Took a little time to get use to a smaller screen, but i really like it know!",0
The size and weight are great and the performance is excellent!,0
"(Almost perfect overall. Rating 9.5 @ 10 pt scale): No dislike so far, could be better if had touch screen.",0
(Excelente máquina): Excelente,0
"(Nice replacement for an Apple product.): I got this for my Daughter who is an Apple person, but was tired of dealing with all the quality and crashing issues associated with their machines. For what it's designed for and what it does, it does well. This is NOT a laptop, so don't expect it to perform like one, but if all you need is word processing, web browsing and other simple functions ( like many people ), this devise is perfect. Good price to performance ratio.",0
(Great laptop): I got this for $500 and it's really great! Fast and does everything I need for work. I love that the screen is so big,0

(Product works fine): But there are a few scratches at the bottom panel.,0
"(Worst Laptop I Ever Bought): I read the reviews and thought it would be good, but its really not worth the $500+ spent on it. It isn't good with multitasking and for a few months I gave up Sims 4 but while I was re-downloading everything for it, my computer froze so many times I thought it was going to have a short life. Wish I could sell it back but know I won't get close to the amount I paid. Sadly I can't afford another computer. Next time I'm just going to stick with a brand I'm familiar with and trust.",0
(Good product but bad seller!): I didn't like the laid back seller who didn't push on time delivery of the unit. MichaelElectronics Fast Shipping should put their feet where their mouth is. Good only in overprint quick delivery but under deluvers... Bad seller!,0
(Great battery life): Love it light weight it's just great . I use it for research battery life excellent,0

(Two Stars): Fine for what it is but cant put many programs on it all online only.,0
"(Good screen quality, bad sound.): Excellent screen quality. There's a little bug that prevents the back light from turning off when you start the computer with another screen plugged in. So you need to witch screens (CTR+P) back and forth once. Then the laptop screen will go fully black. Didn't happen with my other laptop (also Asus). Sound is awful. Zero bass whatsoever, not as loud as my Asus ROG from 6 years ago (similarly priced). So that was disappointing, but built-in sound quality is not a necessity.",0
(Good laptop): The battery life for this laptop is amazing. It lasts me all day. The big issue with this laptop is that the clicker sometimes lags or does not move for a few seconds. It also messes up occasionally when scrolling. These issues occurred very recently after buying the laptop.,0
"(Work nice): It’s okay. Good quality if you’re just using programming like blackboard. But , you can’t save anything and can’t work with word docs",0
It's super light weight for the amount of power it has,0
The upgraded 1080p screen is well worth buying this version for if you watch videos.,0
"(It plays games :)): This laptop is great and is super easy to upgrade memory and ram. Out the box I was playing starcraft 2 high setting, torch light 2, and final fantasy 14 in high setting. All play perfect. Great gaming laptop for the price.",0
"(BUY IT NOW): honestly the best laptop ive ever purchased extremely recommend!!! 2070 inside is a monster with the smooth 144hz refresh makes gaming even on the highest settings a breeze, besides the fan being a little on the louder end i have zero complaints about this pc. my benchmarks- GTA 5 Ultra 112 fps CODMW Ultra 139fps Destroy all humans Ultra 184fps Battlefield 1 Ultra 129 fps!! JUST BUY IT!",0
"(Kinda dim): I like the touch screen, and the 2-in-1 capability. However, the screen brightness is not great (maybe 300 to 350 nits). Also the super-glossy screen creates lots of specular glare, further reducing contrast. Had they used an anti-reflective coating, most of the problem would be gone. As it is, it works fine in a dark room with minimal reflections. In a vehicle in the daylight, forget it. This is a particular problem for me since I bought this device for vehicle navigation. Forget about it in the daytime. I might as well be staring into a mirror. At night I can turn the screen intensity down and set the theme to dark mode.The i7 processor seems fast, until it heats up. That takes about 2 seconds. Then it seems to throttle back. Keep it under 10% processor load, though, and it is great.In laptop mode I do appreciate the largish touchpad. I do not appreciate the lack of buttons below the trackpad. The tilt corner trackpad BS doas not work in the dark! They could help this by adding a lighted trail around the trackpad when the keyboard is lit. At least I could figure out where the corners are at. Otherwise I have to fumble around, then re-position the cursor, then fumble some more to find the correct spot to press, then put on a headlamp so that I can see what the hFll I am doing. Maybe they should include a headlamp to compensate for design oversights. The down side is that the headlamp will reflect off the display and blind the user at the wrong angles. Maybe just don't try to use it in the dark.I do like the keyboard. It is noisy, but users of mechanical keyboards will dig it.The pen seems to work. I tried it once, honest. However, since I have a keyboard that I can fold out, I really haven't found much use for it. That is saying a lot, because I am a hard core handwriting input type from way back. For now, I am not sure where the pen is actually at.Finally, mine came with windows 11 home. For me that means a few things: 1 - Windows 10 in a horifying clown suit, 2 - Loss of some important tactical features, 3 - No drive encryption using bitlocker. The last one is a ""Pro"" feature only. If I decide to ante up for Pro, I will install Windows 10.Oh, one last thing: the laptop will take a second NVMe drive, but installing it is not for the faint of heart. I do not know what the helz they were thinking on this, but adding and swapping hard drives are a given on ANY computer. Personally I would have designed it so that both drives could be ejected/swapped with a button. This little bit tells me that the manufacturer considers this a throw-away device in a couple of years. Maybe they are right.",0
(it was a gift): he loved it,0
"(Best for gaming): I already used this laptop for 2 years and it is still amazing. Very durable. Also its design, steelseries keyboard makes it more special. I recommend it to all.",0
"(Intel i5): Price is right, and pc run little slow",0
"(NOT running Windows 10!!): Despite the top line description listing ""Operating System Windows 10"" - this is in fact running Chrome OS.BE WARNED!",0
"(Fairly good quality): It’s been over nine months and works just fine for my day to day duties. Screen brightness isn’t the best but is ok if you’re not bothered by dim light.Love back light on keyboard, great to use at nights.Very compact and light weight, like the colour too.Battery lasts fairly long as I only need to charge it once per day.",0
"(Extremely Disappointed): I bought this in 2017 for my mom, I have a similar Acer of the same price, the difference is the SSD. I wanted more space, so I decided to just get a regular hard drive, monumental mistake. It runs at about 10% the speed as my other Acer, which once again is the same price, I still use and love. Also, it is 2020 now and as technology advances, things become outdated quickly. That's not to say the previous technology is bad, it's just that the new ones tend to be better and with identical pricing or cheaper. If you're looking for a laptop without breaking the bank let me save you a lot of time and recommend one. I have built quite a few PCs and am pursuing a master's in data science, so I know a bit about computers. Check out the HP 15-dy1036nr, its specifications are nothing short of phenomenal for the price of $599.99. Granted I haven't bought or used it, I'm purely speaking from a hardware standpoint, it comes with 8 GB DDR4-2666 SDRAM, Intel® Core i5-1035G1 which benchmarks twice as well as the CPU on this Acer, and 256 GB PCIe® NVMe M.2 SSD which by the way are the newer SSD's that read/write at 7 times the previous generation SSD's which were already blazing fast to begin with. The laptop has two downsides, it does not come with an optical drive, which is outdated but still could prove to be an inconvenience at one point, however, it's unlikely that'll you ever need it. The second downside is that the laptop comes with a virus by the name of McAfee, uninstall it as soon as you get it. If you need an antivirus, I recommend Malwarebytes, you can get a two-week trial on the premium version to test it, I had premium for around five years, but honestly, the free version should be more than enough.Also, if you're looking for a powerful computer and don't need the mobility of a laptop just build it yourself, you can build one for half the price you would get from a brand such as Alienware. It is also a neat and fun skill to have, watch a couple of YouTube videos, or read some articles to learn how. It really is not difficult; I can build one in about 20 minutes.I acknowledge that this review probably contains the use of poor grammar or incorrect punctuation. I have avoided English classes like the plague my whole life, with that being said it’s probably not the greatest analogy since it seems that people don't avoid the plague at all considering my experiences with Covid.-September 2020",0

"(Decent gaming laptop with ok performance.): Powerful gami laptop, expect to run almost everything at medium and up settings. But expect it heating on the right side of keyboard, cooling system is decent. Temperature never goes up more than 75°C.",0
"(I had forgotten how frustrating windows had become): Overall, its a great buy for the price. Windows 10, however, is a truly frustrating OS. It does everything in its power to keep you from running any application that is not made by them. it’s taken the entire afternoon trying to update and clear out the junk they preload that prevents loading simple apps like chrome. Next time I buy a PC, it won’t be windows.But the laptop is light, looks decent, has good wifi reception. Suits basic browsing needs.*****Update after a solid week of use****. The memory space is limiting. Don’t expect to be able to save anything on the pc directly or it willl cripple the speed of the computer to a snail’s pace. Everything willl have to be saved on a cloud platform, which then requires wifi to access in the future, so keep that in mind.This is my third or fourth ASUS and while you do get a good bang for the buck, they all seem to share a problem with their mousepads. The cursor either gets stuck, hops all over the screeen, or clicks/highlights everything when simply moving it. If you are going to purchase it, I would suggest picking up a decent mouse or you will find yourself quickly frustrated over the nonresponsiveness or hypersensitivity of the pad.I downgraded my review to 3 starts because of the memory and mousepad. Assuming you can work around those issues, then this is a good purchase for you",0
"(Great everyday laptop): As one user stated the screen resolution and hue not good. I find the screen sharpness and brightness great. It has good balanced color. This laptop works fast enough for my use, videos are smooth and downloads fast.",0
"(Hot item, Just not in the good way.): So Im going to start this review with the ups.-Its fast and plays games like Fallout 4 on ultra settings-looks beautiful-Would be great if not for its major flaws which i will now list.-there is really one flaw but its so big it give it a 1 star and gets to be sent back. Plus 1 that is a direct result of that 1 flaw.-it runs HOT. i mean 70° to 80 ° on a simple unity game, it runs hot with Fallout games, it even runs hot with old games like Fallout 3 or Skyrim without mods. That is the kind of BS i have had to deal with. I had issue that also happened when when leaving chrome or firefox open for too long. I even bought a cooling fan with it because i wanted one to help with any heating issues.-to show the extent my fear was with this product. Durring the initial windows installation i could feel the heat coming off the keyboard. It got to the point i feared it would burst into flames.-the initial sign that helped me realize this was when the fans kicked in. Those fans ran as loud as jet engines and did a S!$% job at cooling. I ran Fallout 4 for about 10 min it took about 7 min to dissipate the heat. The inicial heat was 82°C that was the point i gave up and sent it back.-IF YOUR SYSTEM IS DOING THIS SEND IT BACK. THIS IS NOT NORMAL. I LOOKED UP THIS ISSUE ELSEWERE ITS A KNOWN ISSUE.I plan to avoid buying this again and will likely look more closely at these issues beforehand purchasing of another laptop. If this issue is as wide spread as it looks this system needs to be recalled.",0

(Screen gone black after 8 months): Don't purchase this item without the warranty! Lesson learned for me as the screen went black last week and will not come back on. Before that it was working fine. I purchase it September 2019 and it gave out in April 2020! Looking for a way to return it or get it fixed.,0
(Garbage battery life.): I bought this specifically for travel. Battery barely lasts 3 hours. Absolute garbage.,0
"(Really Exceeded my Expectations): This laptop really exceeded my expectations. I am receiving a warranty extension from ASUS for giving my feedback however I genuinely recommend this product for anyone who is looking to do gaming and be mobile at the same time.

"(LOUD & Overheats but nice screen resolution): First thing you notice as you set up the laptop is how loud this thing is. The fans are real loud. So much so that it gets annoying and my wife closes my laptop when I leave the room.Also, it overheats. It is not uncommon for this laptop to do 85 degrees. And no, its not on my lap. I had it mounted on a stand and I even added little pegs to elevate it from the stand to promote air circulation. Didn't change anything.So this week I oprdered a 5 fan cooling pad. It still overheats. I run it around 76-78 degrees with the 5 fan cooling padThis is a major issue for the lonmgevity of the machine. I would not recommend this buy. If could I would return it but i,ve had it for 2.5 months now. I should have returned it immediately. DO NOT RECOMMEND!",0

"(Best value of any gaming laptop, A great upgrade from the GE62): My last gaming laptop was a MSI GE62 Apache Pro series which served me very well over 5 years but the build quality of the case to the hinge made me debate this purchase to another MSI model. I am glad I decided to go with MSI again.For the price I purchased this for I can't find a laptop that has even come close to the price. The RTX2070 has made such a huge difference. All the games I was previously playing on Medium settings I can now play in Ultra at 120+ FPS constantly and the fact that I have a portal unit that can play VR is amazing as well.The keyboard is a beautiful array of colors that is just memorizing effect like that of the high end RGB keyboards. The laptop does get loud when gaming but it disperses heat so much better than the GE62 I had and no longer cooks my twig and giggle berries while on my lap.The build quality has increased greatly and the side bezeling is greatly eliminated and over all the laptop is very light for a gaming laptop as well.I'd highly recommend if you are looking for a new gaming laptop but don't want to spend that $2,000 (US) mark but still get screaming performance.",0
(Great Laptop!): Great laptop computer. Fast and has good battery life. It is lightweight and has a good size screen. My only complaint would be the speakers but I’m sure most laptops aren’t that good. I just use a Bluetooth speaker and am happy with that. Acer is a very good brand and I’ve always been happy with their products. The price was amazing also.,0
(This was a great deal - looked and felt new): I got this for my son who needed a faster computer. It's got a nice i5 processor at a decent clock speed and solid graphics (no discreet card). But he is very happy with the performance. On the one we received the hard drive did crash outside the warranty period - I replaced it with a $50 SSD drive and now the laptop is faster than ever. Aside from the packaging - I could not tell that this was not a brand new computer - no scratches or dents or dead pixels. The battery was able to hold 100% charge. If you're looking fro a laptop for basic gaming and schoolwork - you cannot beat the price and performance of this one.,0
(Nope): Replacement same issue not charging,0
"(Fast, light and great battery life.): Great laptop for our kid going off to university. I used it for a few days and was impressed.Recommended!",0
(Work well while it lasted…): MacBook Air won’t power on after 2 months of minimal use (still transitioning from previous MacBook Air). Customer service not helpful.,0
"(Good device for school work and watching Youtube- bought for my daughter right before the pandemic): Overall, this was a good purchase. I bought it as a present for my daughter about 4 months before the pandemic actually hit for her birthday. She is 9 years old and asked for one. The laptop is simple enough to use, she mainly used it for watching Youtube and playing Roblox. However, when Covid hit, it became her main computer for school. Works well with Google Classroom, camera works well on Zoom as well as audio and connection. Plug in head phones work best. Holds it charge. My main dissatisfaction is that the Bluetooth headphones continuously disconnects when she switches from Zoom to Youtube or vice versa as well as when she is just on one or the other and not switching. The headphones will be fully charged and this still takes place. Definitely an annoyance when she is on a zoom with her teachers.I highly suggest buying a hardshell case as it definitely protects the chromebook from accidental falls, etc.",0
(Awesome): It is nice,0
I find the screen opens and closes very smooth with the right amount of tension and the hinges are very sturdy,0
"(Updates): Do not purchase this laptop.It is lightweight alright, but turns into a nightmare.I purchased it about a month ago, and during this period of time, Samsung has imposed 4 different firmware upgrades. I have had plenty of laptops and never had so frequent firmware updates.Each update ended up on a different issue, first the pin stop working, then accessing zoom and teams became almost impossible, and finally the worst, the internet connection stopped working. Research the internet there are plenty of people with the same problems.So after the last update in order to get connected to the internet I had three options, first to reset the internet network every single time to factory settings, and then if the internet works, zoom and teams don't. Second reset the operational system in full, or change the controller. In other words, the only thing is good is the lightweight.",0

"(Great Laptop, this company WILL NOT stand by their warranty with any reason given): Laptop works well, performs as expected, this review is for the Legion ""ultimate"" support. PLease do not do what i did, and purchase it and accidental damage protection in good faith.

Sent the laptop back to Amazon and waiting for refund.Warning, when I was ordering this product there was NO any indication that this is a previously used device. When I received it, it seems to me it was used before (refurbished) based on attached Amazon label.",0
(Amazing buy!): Love this laptop. Best laptop I've ever owned with zero issues,0
(It's not the best for high quality games.): If you were to play a high graphic game it's pretty laggy no matter what. The fans are super loud too. I have had this for months and now it's pretty much loud over everything I do. Even turning it on is loud. I would just like to say the fans get super loud not long after using. It plays just fine with other games that aren't high quality but it's still loud. The fans now are even loud when I am not playing anything. I could just be watching Youtube and there super loud. Over all its ok not the best. I would not call this a gaming laptop in my opinion it's just super loud over regular games.,0
"(Died in 2 Months, Lenovo Failed to Honor Warranty. Avoid at all costs.): Bought this rig in May 2021, worked great until September 2021 then died. Lenovo service people in Taipei offered endless apologies but still charged me to look at it. Motherboard was fried. Did some research it is a common problem with this model.Got ripped off, and feel cheated.Anyone considering this POS should consider other options. Lenovo is dragging the legacy of IBM through the mud. Avoid Avoid Avoid.",0
(Piece of you-know-what): First laptop ever to have to be returned to the factory for repair due to complete failure within warranty. This is my travel laptop very light use. IT folks put it on their bench and found it to be unresponsive sent it back to manufacturer under their warranty. Can't get them to respond even though we give them the RMA information. Unheard of. Will never buy this brand again.,0
(Worth the price): I needed a laptop that would handle the requirements of my engineering job and this one fills the bill. It's a little more expensive than the average laptop but I needed the capabilities of more than just the average laptop and this one meets and exceeds my expectations. It's definitely a top of the line product.,0

"(Awesome Laptop with Awesome Power): I really like this laptop. It has all the power anyone could really need for the low price point of many comparable systems. The keyboard feels nice and the RGB lighting effects are really cool with the ability to set it to any color you like with some amazing effects to play with. The Dragon Center software took me a little to get it to work right. I actually had to uninstall it and reinstall to get it to work properly but after that it works like a charm. Dragon Center also has a battery function to maintain the battery to your usages type, whether it be gaming, stationary play or mobile play. I thought that was really a cool feature to add. This product offered a free copy of Rainbow Six to download and play....really cool to try out an awesome game if you never played many PC games. Coming from a console to a PC takes a little getting use to but with the RGB lighting on the keyboard it was quick and enjoyable. The keyboard has a great response feel and the keys are nicely spaced for me. The number pad seems a little tight but not bad for a laptop. The screen nice and clear. Very night colors and look. I currently don't have any issues with the screen. The computer does come with some software bloat. Not bad for what could be on it. I have read reviews on the fan noise but to me it is not bad. Even with the extreme performance setting with the fans at high speed it was really not that noisy in my opinion. It is a gaming laptop and with the dual fans you would expect a little more noise. I have seen reviews about this being a large laptop. I was surprised to see it would not that bad in size. Not sure what those reviews are looking for but this is nice size for me. I do have some issues with the power pack that comes with this laptop. It is really large and weights about as much if not more than the laptop. The laptop shell will collect fingerprints and the slightest touch will leave a print. The construction seems to be solid and firm. MSI customer service as been great so far with me. I had an issue registering the product with the numbers from the laptop and they were quick to correct the issue. In closing, this is a wonderful laptop for multi-tasking and gaming, you should not be upset with this purchase or the MSI brand of laptops.",0
"(Just What You Expect From Apple / Mac): I have had my new MacAir not quite two weeks and it is even better than I expected. This one is with the new M1 chip and is an upgrade from my previous Mac....which I loved. Faster, better, more battery. What's not to like. And frankly the price for the machine is a bargain. I do not use my Mac for gaming, heavy downloads, large graphics so can't comment but is why the Air is a perfect choice over the Pro. Transferring files etc from my previous Mac was a snap and now I have my ""old"" Mac on the M1 so everything works better. I was a bit surprised everything is the same size and weight....but that's likely because I didn't look at those specs before purchase. One sweet thing about the Mac is it comes about 70% charged so just open and start. If you are considering a Mac or have one and are thinking about upgrade just do it. And Amazon made it easy....arrived in two days.",0

The finger print reader sometimes refuses to recognize my finger print and then I have to log in with a pin or password. It's not very loud on volume at all,0

"Touch screen is great, speed of turning on and off the laptop is super fast",0
"(The screen sux): Not sure if I got bad one, but the screen is so much crappier than my old acer cb311 IPS. I can't find an angle where the blacks don't turn to blues and there's a noticeable gradient (light at the bottom to negative black at the top).Everything else seems fine. It's all plastic and has a dumb glossy bezel and the screen is terrible and I like my old one better but it's an ok piece of equipment I guess.",0

(Five Stars): The perfect laptop.,0
"(Windows 10 S... or else): The screen is of nice quality. The touch screen is responsive. The battery life seems fine. But... did you know this is locked down so you can only use Microsoft products? Yes, you can revert to Windows Pro but then the speed and performance tanks. So, buyer beware. Basically, it is fine if just for low end school or business needs. If you use Chrome or run programs and apps that can not be found in the MS store, then run... run fast bc this is not the laptop for you.",0
(Impresionante calidad y desempe?o a un precio competitivo): Muy buen producto,0

"(Worth Buying If You Don't Abuse You're Stuff): I bought this laptop about 1 year ago and it works great, I have had no issues with it. That being said I would also like to point out that I am extremely careful with my thing, and I take care of them. I still have a Dell Inspiron N5110 with an Intel Core i5-2410M in it and it still works great. Bought that from Best buy back in 2011 for $700.",0
"(Exceeds expectation): This thing is a beast in addition to beauty. Very impressed with it's overall responsiveness, graphics and performance even at the highest settings. I will likely be adding an additional ssd and probably amp the ram up to 32 just because, but it's a great laptop out of the box. I've been wanting a true gaming laptop for a while and this was certainly the right choice.",0
(Great price on a very capable computer.): Gear fit and finish. Very well known brand that holds up to its name well.,0
"(Satisfied with the price and specifications): Amazing price at SGD$336 including shipping during Black Friday Sales. No GST charged. Good specifications such as i3. This laptop has extra Sata and Ram slots, easy to open casing for installation of HDD/SSD and Ram upgrades. Keyboard is not lighted. Casing a bit filmsy.",0
"(Decent Laptop): Construction feels solid. Lightweight but sturdy and thin profile. Not the world's best screen but manageable unless you're obsessed with HD. The number pad on the right of the keyboard is virtually useless, as it doesn't follow traditional keypad format. The rest of the keyboard is great and a joy to type on. Very responsive, and takes all of five seconds to remove the pre-installed Microsoft S for normal Windows 10. All and all, well worth the $400. It's not going to set any records but it will handle 90% of population's needs.",0
Steel Series keyboard lighting control is a bit glitching when swapping between games & desktop mode,0

"(Ordered 3 chromebooks but only two arrived): It is very rare that Amazon could miss an item in a shipment. Order 3 chromebooks but only two were delivered in the box, The shipping label was cut from another box and tapped to the shipping box. BTW Amazon's customer service is quite good. Got refund for the missing chromebook via on-line chat.However, the Chromebook itself is great.",0
(I would recommend to a friend): Everything works good. Haven't used it for gaming yet.,0
(Disappointing): I posted that too early. Laptop is working now. Evidently overheated so will check on if it needs a new fan. It is easy to use and convenient to travel with.,0
"(Not worth the money.): Dell's XPS 13 is a decent ultrabook, however, not for the price. For the price you can get a laptop that can run almost any game or program. Since there is no graphic card (rather it is built in), it cannot run high demanding games. The XPS 13 can run any basic program I need for school, but that is about it. Also, it gets incredibly hot and to the point where I cannot set my hand on it for more than a few seconds. Finally, there are several bugs that revolve around the Dell software. On the positive, it has a very nice screen and uses high quality build materials.",0
I like how Windows now gives access to an appstore.,0
"(Wonderful little machine): Tough to beat the value here - small, light, fast, reliable, cheaper than MAcbook Air",0
"(Very happy): I love this laptop. It replaced an Acer aspire 5 slim, which was quite heavy, and had a battery that lasted five hours. In power saver mode. It was only two years old and rarely used until I started a new job and school. I had my MacBook going from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. Because I have an iPhone, I can make calls and send texts with it. My iPad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. The mac doesn’t skip a beat- I can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. It’s not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. The Mac OS not supporting steam titles thing isn’t a huge deal- If I want a gaming machine, I have a desktop. For getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone. My one gripe is lack of USB-A ports, but I’ll buy an adapter and move on with my life. Overall, try a MacBook Air… You’ll like it. UPDATE: I found a program called Parsec and so long as my Mac has a stable WiFi connection, I can remote into my desktop and use steam along with everything else.",0
(Inaccurate description): Description of product said ‘touch screen’ which turned out to be a false statement. Had to return the computer,0
"(Five Stars): Great machine, amazon send the laptop ok",0
"(Solid Gaming Computer): I play games that demand a lot out of a computer and didn’t have any problems playing any games at medium to high graphics. Pretty nice download speedsSolid for the price, storage is low so I ended up getting an external drive and the fans can be loud but with a head set on you don’t even notice it. I’d recommend this laptop",0
(Performs as described): Purchased this for my mother. She loves it! Screen is clear and easy for her to use.,0
(Short life span): Purchased in March and it stopped working by October.,0
"(Fantastic Laptop; Thinking of getting another for my nephew): Great power and performance for the price. It's get's a little warm, but the cooling pad I have underneath keeps things in check. It's plays Overwatch and my other favorites on full settings without any flaws. Love this thing!",0
"(great for the price): Met most of my expectations, great for the price. The only negative is the screen at different viewing angles.",0
"It's lightweight, fast & the graphics are good quality.",0
(Not impressed.): Hard drive had problems. After 3 days of owning the screen went out.,0
"(Still Reliable): I purchased this as a replacement for my daughter's older Samsung Chromebook and it works just as good as the former one. My son also has one and prefers it over his 15 inch laptop for his frequent travels to other countries. Every household should have a Chromebook, if not as a main computer, at least as a reliable backup.",0
I'm currently using it for video editing and gaming video capture for my Youtube channel and so far so good.,0
(Great laptop): I don’t use my laptop for games. I really like the 14 inch laptop because it is lightweight.,0
"(Low quality, barely lasted one year): Very disappointed in this product. I only use my computer to access the internet and use Microsoft Office products. No gaming or graphic design work and not storing a lot of photos. I've had the laptop just over once year. It now freezes regularly or the screen goes blank. I can't reboot out so I have to wait for the battery to die to restart it. Again, there's no major computing going on here. It doesn't have any virus or malware problems. I tried contacting HP customer service before my warranty expired with no luck. The only live person I got in touch with was through chat and they kept getting disconnected. I never ended up being able to work through these issues. Couldn't get someone on the phone and my recent outreach after my warranty expired was an automated response sending me in circles. Best to go with a reliable brand and product. Pay a little extra if you need to. The product and service quality are not worth the cost.",0
"(Too Many Shortcomings for Me): Loved many aspects of this laptop, but key shortcomings made it a deal-breaker for me. I returned it after a long trial.I currently use my 14” Lenovo X1 Carbon as my only computer. I travel extensively with it nationally and internationally. I use my laptop for heavy writing and editing, financial work, and photo editing. I almost always use it on my lap, versus on a table-top.The Gram 17” caught my attention due to the screen, weight, and battery life. I sometimes edit with two documents open side-by-side and the larger screen seemed ideal.What I liked: Screen size and sharpness, weight (although same as my X1), battery life, and much cooler running than my X1 (also the exhaust out of the hinge area moves the head away from my lap).What I didn’t like:Keyboard: The keyboard is critical for me. This was is substandard. Many keyboard shortcuts that involve one or two simultaneous button pushes on the X1 require three on the Gram. Why they consolidated keys on a computer with this much real estate is a mystery. The touchpad is centered on the entire keypad, rather than over the letters. I found myself regularly touching the touchpad and inadvertently moving things around by accident. Very frustrating. The idea of a dedicated number pad (as on this unit) seems absurd to me for general use, but definitely doesn’t work for a writer/editor. Bottom line: The biggest problem for me was the keyboard layout.Screen: The screen is highly reflective. I mostly work in natural light with a mirrored wall behind me. In strong daylight the screen can be very hard to use.Proprietary charger: My X1 has a USB C charger, which I can also use for my phone. The Gram has a proprietary charger. Complete wasted of an input.Size: For travel, this computer is just a little too big. Hard to get into a standard laptop sleeve and on airplanes would be hard to open with a seat in front of me. I sometimes work for hours on a plane and even my smaller X1 is cramped in some cases.Wobbliness: Because of the size of the screen, when using on a lap, the screen tends to waggle a bit. Not a huge deal, but it’s the nature of a light laptop and large screen.What would change my mind: If they were to redesign the keyboard to center it on the letter keys, perhaps dropping the right side number pad altogether, the greatest impediment to use would disappear. They could also spread out the keypad and reduce/eliminate the need for multiple key presses. The screen needs to be non-reflective. I would prefer a version with a 15 or 16 inch screen to reduce the overall size. They should dump the proprietary charger.",0
(Laptop works for me!): The laptop is great for me since I use it for my college projects and to complete homework. The battery life is great because I can literally be in school for 6 to 8 hours and still come home with at least 30% battery. The finger print scanner works just fine for me the one thing I don’t like which I wish was better is the volume. If your in a quiet room with no notice you’ll be able to hear just fine but it does lack. If you plug in some headphones you should be fine. Backlit keyboard is great comes in handy. I will say I wish it was touchscreen could be so much better. Something else that kinda bugs me I feel like I have to keep wiping it down all around since you can see real quick all the fingerprint marks. Besides that it works for me.,0
An eye-tracking system that allows the customer to scroll and select items on the screen without having to use their hands,1
"(A great laptop for the price): This laptop is everything I was hoping it to be. Not many complaints besides the batter life being kinda short but it doesn't matter since I always use it when plugged in anyway, I also don't have a real use for the rgb keyboard but it's pretty to have. Overall a great gaming laptop for the price.",0
"(Good computer): I loved the computer; however, I was disappointed it didn't come with a pen. I also was disappointed because no pen was compatible with the computer. With that, I had to return it get something else that would be what I was looking for and what I could use for my business.",0
(The screen went blank after 7 months): Since this was sold by Amazon I thought it would be a good product. The screen went blank today and I just gave it to my granddaughter in August....terrible,0
The screen is very pixelated (outdated) for normal everyday laptop use,0
"(Samsung does not honor their warranties): Samsung does not honor their warranty. The right outer hinge stopped working, so when I lifted the lid the screen cracked. I called Samsung and they had me send the device in. I received a call about a week later, they claimed that there had been water damage and would not repair. I don't remember spilling any water on the device, and what would that have to do with a frozen hinge?I will not be buying anymore Samsung products.",0
"(A sharp knife for productivity): Lightweight, a keyboard with good touching feeling, heat distribution is good, and the fan is not noisy with a fast CPU and ssd, making it an excellent productive machine.",0
"(Tal como fue solicitado.): Recibi el articulo con la misma calidad que el de una tienda. Sin problemas hasta el momento. Inicialmente pensé que el equipo tendría 8 GPU sin embargo he recibido la versión de 7 GPU aunque para mí esta bien hubiese querido 8, creo que parte de la descripción del producto eran 8 GPU.En cuanto a la temperatura un poco preocupado porque en ciertos momentos del día presenta un indice alto para mi, sin embargo consultando con Apple vía soporte me han comentado que se encuentra dentro de los rangos.",0
"(Quality , Light and easy to carry): This laptop I'm already using more than 5 months, i didst encounter a single issue with it. Works really fast and its especially good for those who are traveling a lot. Battery life is more than 2 hours",0
"(Great value for your money): I think what surprised me the most about this laptop wasn't it's performance and specs, but the value for your money considering the performance and specs. The IPS screen looks great, the keyboard lights up in different patterns, the battery life is OK, not great, but considering it's a gaming laptop, it does fine. I see another reviewer showed some specs so no use in repeating that. I guess the only thing I would like to see in these ""GAMING"" labeled laptops is higher capacity M.2 drives.. A 1Tb option would have made this a perfect value but I won't deduct a star. The reason I say that, is any more, many games consume alot of space, and if you have a huge collection, well.. you run out pretty quick. 512gb on this one is actually within reason and expected.. I guess I'm just griping that I'd like to see large quantity, fast storage, also become a standard when one claims to have a ""GAMING"" laptop. But anyways, WHERE CAN I GET AN RTX 3050Ti FOR MY DESKTOP??? I love this thing!! Seriously, no need to spend money on something spec'd with a 3080 on a laptop, this thing rocks!! And the fan sound doesn't ramp up too loud at all. A nicely done laptop all around if you don't count my nit pics. Gonna have to 5 star this one.",0
"(Powerhouse in a small package): This machine is a beast! As one who has a limited budget and looks to get a laptop that will last for a handful of years, this was the perfect fit. The price was great at the time of the purchase, and it comes with a FULL RTX 2070 (non-max Q)! This laptop benches a little higher than a desktop RTX 2060, and in some functions on par with a desktop RTX 2060 super. This means that in a few years I won't find myself wishing I had more power for gaming and video editing. While in the latter I would have loved to see this unit with a 4800H Ryzen 7, the 10th gen i7 is no slouch and is a strong upgrade from my old dated 7700HQ i7 where I was beginning to have issues when editing videos for YouTube.The laptop appearance is very nice as well with per key RGB, thin bezels, a fast 144 hz IPS like screen with around a 3 ms response time which means crystal clear and very responsive FPS. It was so crazy good that I had to learn to adjust to the response times being used to an older 60 HZ screen on my old laptop.So, the bottom line is that I strongly recommend this laptop. It is plenty powerful to run all triple A titles at max settings and have good to great frame rates.",0
(This will not work with regular printers): Has to be all cloud based printing and is a MAJOR HASSLE. I never did get it to work.,0
"(Great!): Love this chrome book - perfect for everyday stuff like browsing web and general home computing activities. My first chrome book and can’t believe I never had one before, like much better than my laptop, and fraction of the cost.",0
"(Reliability in question after heavy use): REVISED REVIEW after continued use. If you get this machine, definitely invest in a multi-yeared service. It's been less than a year and machine now disconnects randomly, overheats and is rather unreliable for regular (not gaming) use! BUYER BEWAREThe speed, extra features - like the cooling fan, multi-colored light-up keys, etc. made this a very, very well received gift for my young gamer. It is sturdy, well-constructed and reliable piece of technology. Two thumbs up",0
"(It would be great if the laptop would actually work.): 7 months ago, there was an issue where the laptop glitched into oblivion. It would not turn on. After contacting Lenovo support, they sent a guy in for onsite repair, and all was fine. However, within a day, a similar but new issue sprang up: The laptop would not turn on, but the fans would be spinning at full blast. A power drain seemed to fix the issue, and everything was fine until mid-late April. Now, whenever the laptop goes to sleep or shuts down, there is a chance that it won't be able to turn back on. Everything will be off, but the fans will be spinning. Each time this occurs, I have to open up the laptop to disconnect the battery from the motherboard just so I can do a power drain. Sometimes this takes 20 seconds, other 90+, and the two times it took over 30 minutes. Support is slow and isn't helpful. I no longer care for a replacement when the issue could come right again around the corner, but without a warranty. I'm done. Learn from my mistake. Avoid laptops, or avoid Lenovo Laptops, and go build a PC.",0

(Great laptop): Great size. Good quality! easy to set up and use.,0
"(Chromebook): I'm a teacher and it's all about Google Classroom. All of the students and staff were issued the smaller chromebooks. They've seen a lot of use and the mouse pad and keys aren't working well, so I purchased this larger Acer Chromebook. I'm glad I did. It's easier on my eyes and everything works well.",0
"(Solid laptop): This seems to be a very solid machine with great specs.Physical is very good for a 15.6"" laptop.The only cons so far is that the build is not all metal as I was lead to think by the Q&A section, only the display cover is made out of metal.And it seems to get hot quite fast, which means fans are on.All in all, great machine for the money!",0
"(DOA): Laptop wouldn’t turn on right out of the box which I found strange. I’ve owned tons of laptops and they come with enough of a charge to get ya going. So I let this piece of junk charge for 2 hours came back n it turned on. I used it for a day. Let it sit idle, came back the next day and it’s turned off. Fully charged, blue light on the side. Won’t turn back on. Getting sent back and won’t make the same mistake twice. Garbage",0
"(Holy Bloatware): Always wanted a sleek and light, relatively powerful (i7) laptop. The new Galaxy Book2 delivers on the former but is seriously lacking in the latter. The laptop has performed no better than my previous one, an Asus Vivobook, which has a now three-year-old i5 processor. Moreover, the TouchPad is glitchy and confuses two-finger commands for three-finger ones, although that may be a Windows 11 issue.Overall, I am disappointed and would not recommend this laptop at its current price point of $1,150. If thinness is not a priority, one can find a similarly performing machine for 30% less, I figure.EDIT: Between Samsung and Microsoft, this computer comes with about 80 apps running in the background. After uninstalling all the ones I'd never use, as well as disallowing almost any from running in the background, the computer is performing much more as expected.Edit 2: I'm now getting random black screens, and there are numerous other little bugs like the cursor appearing random places on the page while I'm in the middle of typing something.",0
"(Fantastic Gaming Laptop for the price): I have been running strictly off a Chromebook for 6 years. It was fine for my needs. I run D&D and other TTRPGs online, and it never missed a beat in all that time. However, more and more the tools for online gaming are vastly improved. I want to be able to use the map building, and other VTT tools that require I download and run software.So I finally broke down and bought a windows device again. The added benefit of being able to play PC games again was a bonus, and omg, this thing is fantastic. I run on max settings and it just flies. Every game I play is beautiful and fast. No temperature issues at all, and yet it is quiet as a mouse. Even the keyboard is soft and quiet.If I have any issue at all, it is the battery life. I am thinking about replacing it, as I can barely get 3-4 hours of usage off power. And that is just running web pages like Roll20 and Discord. Not heavy gaming. I only use the proper charger, but the battery life sucks, even when I am not using it. Just carrying it in my bag, I will lose 10-15% battery. I am used to my chromebook that goes for 8-10 hours, so maybe I am spoiled.If you want an affordable gaming rig, this is it.",0
"(I love this laptop): I love this laptop. it is really fast and looks awesome. Great Deal. Everything that I was looking for.I bought this laptop to use primarily for coding and making websites and software development which I know you don't really need a PC of this caliber for but I tend to go a little over board and wanted something nice that would last a long time and be really fast. Originally I was looking at the MacBook Pro but for $2800 for the 15 inch screen I couldn't justify spending that much. This Laptop PC IS WAY MORE POWERFUL at a fraction of the price! Windows defended is actually pretty good antivirus although I ended up downloading AVAST free antivirus which is a little better. What would you rather spend? 3000 after tax on a smaller screen macbook pro with shitty keyboard or 1500 for a way more powerful faster PC?Also I bought the game PUBG and play it from time to time and this Laptop handles the game really well.PRO'S:super fastGreat hardware for the price, see specs...keyboard is a joy to type on and I really like how it lights up and you can customize the colorsplenty of usb ports and HDMI etc...Doesn't come loaded with too much junk software. I only had to uninstall a few programs ie.(mcafee antivirus, clash of clans, and a couple other apps I wasn't using)THIS LAPTOP IS A BEASTCONS:This laptop does tend to get fairly hot. You will definitely need to buy a cooling fan. ( i bought the Tree New Bee cooling pad for $20 (the blue one with four fans))The battery life on this thing kind of sucks. You can adjust the battery performance usage but doesn't make a huge difference. Only lasts 2 -3 hours however I always have the charging cable with me so that's not really a problem for me.At the end of the day. For $1460, you won't find another laptop with a 17.3” screen 120Hz , GTX 1060 6GB, Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB PCIe SSD + 1TB SSHD, RGB KeyboardGreat deal and really sleek.This may not be the right laptop for you, but for me it is Awesome. Just wish the battery lasted longer and that it didn't get so hot but those are minor issues for me.",0
"(Great Laptop!!): This is a great laptop, I first ordered an ASUS Tuf and returned it due to it not starting up. After further research, I decided to spend the extra few hundred dollars on this laptop. Out of the box, downloaded games such as Call of Duty, Fortnite, Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege and all work excellent. I bought a hard wire for the internet thinking I would need it to prevent lag for gaming, but have not once needed to connect the cable and the cable is still in its box....................ONE THING: I do want to point out is that this laptop will get HOT fast for gaming. It does have the turbo fan, which is much needed, and the turbo helps cool down the laptop, but the turbo feature is loud. I just recently ordered a fan pad and still waiting for that to come in. The only suggestion is if you order this laptop (GREAT LAPTOP AND FAST) I would suggest ordering a cooling pad also. This way you can have it cooled down maybe more quietly without having to run the Turbo fan on the laptop. I have no regrets ordering this laptop. VERY, VERY PLEASED with its performance and would recommend to anyone looking to game. I bought the 512Gb for the extra space. I hope this laptop lasts me a while cause it is AWESOME!!!",0
(Love it!): Love the thin design! Beautiful screen. Great features. Fast shipping. So far so good!,0
"(Faulty software makes the devices do not work.): I tried to update my mobile computer hardware to the latest generation of ASUS products. However, ASUS products have proven to be COMPLETELY USELESS as their control software, ""Armory Crate"" for the LED lighting, keybinding, and mouse polling rate does not work simply because it won't detect the devices. Avoid any ASUS ROG product that uses that software. I eventually had to return every piece (computer, mouse, headset) back to Amazon (which they were able to do so successfully and got me set up with a better computer from a different manufacturer).",0
"(Awesome laptop for what is intended for.): This laptop is for everyday users, attending most classes, researching stuff online, watching YouTube, paying bills etc. This laptop is not intended for hardcore gamers and ultra high quality content creators. It is capable for learning content creation but you will outgrow this machine, that is why a MacBook Pro exists.",0
(I have trouble seeing the writing on the keys and am sorry i didn't get a touch screen): If I could have figured out how to clear what we already put on the laptop I would have returned it,0
(Excelente producto): Me gusto la rapidez y lo ligero del equipo,0
"(Technoogy doesn't work): Yu need a strong cell connection to get the service to work. It won't work in marginal areas.Plus even though it is a 64 bit processor, When you install software, the computer reads only 32 bit. I couldn't load Adobe Lightroom.",0
"(Five stars all day, any day): The only thing I mildly dislike is the battery life. It could probably last longer. I should also say that I use it in the high performance mode which drains the battery faster.This computer has been perfect for my needs (hobby gamer) at a price that won’t break the bank. Five stars all day.",0
"(Lemon.): I got a lemon. It didn't work, overheated as soon as I turned it on. Complete trash. And then after calling for over a month, and waiting for 2 months after I received confirmation that I returned the item and it was delivered by ups, I finally got a refund. Huge waste of time, get it somewhere else.",0
(Awesome@): Love the touch screen@,0
"(So light and fast..READ UPDATE !!): So far so good.I had a Lenovo Idea laptop for 6 years .It was fanatastic ,never broke down ,but is running slow now.And is so heavy.The Asus is so light 2.6lbs versus 4.7lbs.It boots in seconds,is fast,great picture on screen.If it holds up im going to really like it.Some reviews scared me .Noisy fan ,can't hear the fan at all.So do I have any complaints ? Well yes ,not serious ones .Too few USB's only 2 ,I always had 3 and miss the extra one.The keys are ok ,only ok ,not excited about them.Also I thought the keyboard was backlit,well ttheyr'e not..Despite those negatives ,I think I will really love this computer .I think you will too.I'm glad I waited for the 8th generation ,it's great.1/14/2018 :After using this for a couple of weeks ,I have simmered down a bit.First I wish the screen was a little sharper and being a small screen it gets a little hard to read the lettering.I also notice that the sound while ok ,is not too great.I'm comparing this Zen to a Lenovo ideapad which is 6 or 7 years old,much sharper, better sound ,but almost twice as heavy.I notice it is (kinda) backlit ,again not as well backlit as the Lenovo .I will say the Lenovo cost $200 more than the Zen.What I appreciate most is the 7 second boot time and the long battery life.2/2/2018An update.I got a scare a week ago.I got a black screen ,it wouldn't boot.I kept trying turning of and on for an hour.Eventually it started to work again.I did a restore point.The only problem with buying a computer online is ,it's not easy to return.Prices are better on Amazon but unlike Best Buy you can't drive and return it.Food for thought.7/6/2018AN UPDATE: After more than 6 months ,I want to alert you about this computers shortcomings.There are two big ones.The sound system is bad ,I cant hear hardly anything the sound is so low at full settings.Tech support put in new drivers which did nothing ,very disappointed .I would advise not buying this computer on this alone.The second issue ,the keyboard is crap and was crap from the day I took delivery .It has what is called sticky keys .Meaning when typing you have to go back to enter missing letters.NOT GOOD.",0
(Buen articulo): Buena compra,0
"(It more than meets my needs): I purchased this Chromebook to use as a travel computer instead of my 15-inch laptop. It meets those needs very nicely. I use Chrome as my browser, so the transition was virtually seamless. The most significant adjustment is the smaller keyboard size that makes touch-typing difficult, but I am adapting. For the price, a great deal.",0
I found the keyboard very uncomfortable for gaming,0
"(spoiled user experience, asus tech support was useless.): seemed like a cool little unit. i liked the look and build-feel of it. the ""screenpad"" seems like a novelty at first but actually showed a bit of potential for use as a desktop extension when using an application full-screen on the regular LCD. call me picky, but unfortunately being one of those people who doesn't like the clutter and eventual ragged worn look of stickers, the ""zen"" only lasted long enough for me to de-sticker it. i believe there were SEVEN ""marketing"" type stickers on this unit. all came off easily *except* the large screenpad ""feel the magic"" one that sits under one's right hand while typing. in that case, multiple attempts from different edges all produced the same result: sticker peeled clean, adhesive FIRMLY attached to laptop. perhaps the pressure sensitive adhesive was mistakenly put on this sticker with the ""agressive"" side the wrong way. certainly there are multiple ways to get this off, but not wanting to experiment and possibly damage the finish (or nearby screen-pad, or fingerprint sensor) i figured i'd contact ASUS for their input. well, their input was that they do not recommend removing the stickers and if a customer chooses to do so, that's the customers responsibility and problem. and of course they would not be held accountable for any finish damage that might occur. no useful recommendations whatsoever on such a simple thing left me with a bad customer ""support"" taste. the retailer i purchased this from (BB) was similarly unhelpful. after wasting a couple of hours on this project, i concluded i was done ""touching their magic"" and returned it. i now own a similarly spec'd dell that came with exactly one easily removed i7 sticker.",0
(Bad performance): Computer runs great when hooked up to an external monitor. But if you’re running on the Laptop screen itself the performance is horrible,0
(Hopeful. Too soon to tell.): In the middle of trying to resolve an issue with the laptop frequently losing WiFi internet connection whereas our other devices stay connected. Hopeful that we don’t have a lemon. Love the slim lightweight design.,0
"(Good laptop, totally recommended!): A laptop with good performance, very light! I liked it!",0
"(Lives Up To Hype): I purchased the MacBook Air to replace a 4th Gen Surface Pro that was down to about 30 minutes of battery life. I purchased an Intel Mac Mini about six months ago and was intrigued by recent news articles regarding the M1 chip. I'm thrilled with the added battery life on the new device and amazed by the speed difference between my Intel-based mini vs. the M1. Out of the box, adding a full charge, the new Mac estimates 19+ hours of battery life. I've been using the computer for three hours, four open apps, and have bumped the battery gauge to 98%. Think I've eliminated battery anxiety. App launches are two to three times faster on the Air vs. my Mini. The new laptop is zippy! I'm thrilled with my new laptop and look forward to many years together.",0
(I like this laptop): everything as described,0
(Fantastic value - powerful laptop): You get a big bang for your buck on this one. I have a $2500 acer and this one is almost as good. It has good video and audio quality. It is sleek and has a nice look and feel The battery life could be better but this is not a big deal to me. This laptop this is just a great buy and should be not missed. Highly recomended!!.,0
(Great For School Work): Bought this for my son (who is 8). It is exactly like the one they have at school. He loves it! It's a great chromebook and he loves logging into his class link account from home! Considering a second one for his younger sister.,0
(Great unit.): This is a great chromebook. I bought one for my wife and soon after I went and got one for myself. Everything is same as my wife's except mine is 1080 the picture is sharper don't tell her that!,0
The screen is clear and crisp,0
144hz refresh rate is awesome for portable gaming,0
"(Ram upgrade for Acer Nitro 5 (Model: AN515-54-5812)): The following ram works perfectly to upgrade from 8 to 16GB:Kingston 8GB DDR4 2666MHZ SODIMM KCP426SS8/8This is for the Core i5-9300H version, but should be just fine for any AN515-54-58XX model.Computer is great, by the way.",0
(Huge waste of money!!!!!): This is the biggest piece of garbage ever made. I had one and it crashed within a month of using it. Got a replacement and that crashed in less than 2 weeks. I don't know how this has 4 stars. It is a pile of trash!,0
"(Awesome): Good choice, great purchase.",0
"(Muy buena calidad): Si por diversas razones uno decide no comprar la Macbook Air, esta es la mejor alternativa que conozco. Lo único que noto como de inferior calidad es el pad. Lo demás, muy bueno.",0
"(Awesome!): Best laptop I have had, the i7 10th gen preforms well under heavy load (I'm a software developer) and the graphics are top of the line. I like the anti reflective screen and light up keyboard as well. A little loud, but that is expected to cool down the internals with the open mesh bottom. Overall it's a great laptop and I think it future proofs me for while.",0
"(Streaming, Video edit, Casting, Gaming all possible): Shifting from a gaming Asus ROG laptop to this has been surprisingly wonderful/all around positive experience. Only upgrades I did were the installation of a 2TB nvme Samsung 970, and doubled the ram. However I did these upgrades well after already performing the tasks below. However the ram and storage has made editing 4k recordings with no delays. I also was able to get those components on a very good sale which justified the impulse as it was a nice to have not a need to have upgrade.Laptop is used daily interacting with the following pieces of software routinely.GAMES // - Call of Duty // - Fortnite - //Halo Infinite //- DigitalPaintball (digitalpaint.org)SOFTWARE : Adobe Cloud (After Effects, Photoshop, Premier)HypervisorVMWare WorkstationDeployment toolkitAudacityOBS Open Broadcast studio",0
"(Buena bonita y barata): Cumple con lo que ofrece la única queja es que la pintura de las teclas se le cae muy muy rápido, a solo un mes de uso ya hay teclas que pierden la capa de pintura. Si se quiere usar para gaming hay que considerar comprar RAM extra, por lo demás funciona muy bien y por el precio con el monitor de 144hz que tiene vale la pena",0
"(Excelente rendimiento): Es un excelente computador al menos para programas de ingeniería civil y arquitectura además de liviana y buena resolución de pantalla, las desventajas por mencionar es la batería que dura menos que otros computadores de la misma gama y también que se debe tener mucho cuidado para poder instalarle un disco sólido adicional ya que es difícil extraer la tapa.",0
"(A solid laptop): I've owned a few Acer's in my life, my previous laptop was a different brand but the one before that was also an Acer so I decided to go back to it when I needed an upgrade. This is such a solid laptop. Boots up quickly and easily. It's relatively lightweight and the screen looks great. I honestly don't have any complaints. I was able to install Chrome and the other programs I like very easily and it was working for me instantly once I plugged it in. This is not a power horse machine, but for regular non-gaming computer work, it's pretty perfect. We use this one for the kids homework, emails and just general home use, and it's exactly what we need. The price is great too so we don't worry about the younger kids using it because it's not a huge investment.",0
"(Excelente servicio, rapidez y eficiencia): El producto es lo que esperaba solo que el teclado no es para el idioma espa?ol y no recuerdo haber leído esa diferencia en la descripción del producto.",0
"(Great product, unreliable seller): This is a really solid starter gaming laptop, it really fits all my needs. Only thing worth mentioning is the RAM is only 8GB, I’d definitely recommend getting a 16GB upgrade, but it does come with instructions on how to upgrade with the laptop. Still, it’s a very solid choice.",0
"(Basic, good laptop. Lightweight.): This was a perfect fill in when my other laptop quit during the school closure. Very basic to operate. Good screen quality.",0
(Sold broken laptop): I didn't want to complain about it but I got sold a broken laptop and I didn't pay it to much mind cause I just need a new more capable laptop but now I look at it and it cause me more and more problems when I open it I just wish I would have gotten a brand new not broken laptop that was pawned off on me,0
I like the backlit feature that only lights up when in use.,0
"(Blue Screen Crashes): I received a laptop that experiences frequent blue screen crashes resulting in lost work/productivity. This laptop is an egregious waste of money, I do not recommend buying acer.",0
(Five Stars): Working good so far,0
"(Plays all modern games at high settings. Looks great, runs great!): Great gaming laptop. Runs latest titles in have on epic settings. It's a tad loud but it's a gaming laptop and expected, same with battery life. Screen looks great, runs very smoothly.",0
(This laptop is op): It’s op,0
"(Decent): Pretty good, a bit loud and the soft screen makes it difficult to see sometimes",0
"(Computer Had Hardware Problem But Dell Stepped Up And Fixed It.): [Update 12/20/2018] I worked with Dell on this issue and finally had to send the computer back to Dell for service. They replaced the main board and the computer seems to be working fine. Credit here to Dell for standing behind their product.But going through the diagnosis and repair is a pain. The technical support people wanted to eliminate all the software possibilities so we kept trying things including a clean re-install of Windows - which wiped my machine.After we eliminated all the software possibilities, Dell sent me a box and I shipped it back to them on a Tuesday. I received the unit back on the following Wednesday.But this is all things that shouldn't have happened. The computer should have operated properly when I received it. Perhaps it was defective and was not refurbished properly. It would have been worth a few extra dollars to avoid all of this service headache.Note that this is not a ding on Dell but on the company who claimed to refurbish the computer. Dell stepped up and fixed the unit.+++++++++++++++++++[Update] I'm experiencing a problem with this computer in that it gives a Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD) occasionally. It recovers from the BSOD and goes back to normal operation. I'm working with Dell now to find a solution. They believe it's a software problem but if that were correct, it seems that everyone would be having the BSOD problem. I'll post a follow-up after I work with Dell some more. Really disappointing. I've never had a computer that was this unreliable.++++++++++++++I've only had the computer for a couple of days - it's a refurb unit. The computer was clean and unmarked - looked like new. Setup was normal and the unit functions like I'd expect a new computer to function.It was packed well and was shipped quickly. Not much else to say - I'll have to wait until I have more time with it to see if any problems crop up. I thought the price was fair considering it has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. I'll probably have to upgrade it to a 1TB SSD at some point in the future - I checked the maintenance manual and an upgrade looks pretty easy.",0
(Five Stars): Very happy with this chromebook.,0
"(Fits my need, can't complain much): My only complaint is the audio quality is not as good as my old acer laptop, but I understand such thin laptop cannot be perfect for everything. My ZOOM meeting pals ""seemed"" to have a hard time hearing me, but when I asked, they all said they can hear me okay, I wasn't sure if there's any issue.I just need a medium screen size, light weight, mid-high functional laptop, so I don't have to travel with a heavy one, and this one fits all what I need. Just need to buy extra headset and speaker if I want to enjoy better sound. It was not too bad, so I still give 5 stars.",0
"(Legion is the best!): I’m almost certain that the Legion is the best cost to performance ratio out there currently. Get one while you can, you will not regret it.",0
It is nice that you can help reduce the internal temperature when you are in some really intense games.,0
(Not worth the money): Very unhappy with this computer. The keyboard doesn’t work properly. The keys are completely mixed up and there is actually no hashtag button. We are going to return it.,0
"(Powerfull and cheap): Great for proce, feel really durable and premium",0
(Gaming computer): My son loves his computer he can play his game whenever we go,0
"(Virgin -> Chad): I spent about 1 month comparing every gaming laptop to try and get the best bang/buck and this was it. I've had it for about ~2 months and have abused it. 12+ hours of straight gaming and right after watching movies, this thing had no problems. If you are reading reviews because you are on edge scroll back up and buy this, don't be a loser. Keyboard + Numpad + Screen + Sleek Design, since I have purchased this I have had sex about 3 times a day, before this laptop I was a virgin.",0
"(Five Stars): Works great, and cheaper than my last laptop! Definitely recommend it!",0
(Bien): Trabaja como esperaba,0
(Excelente compra): Funciona bien es rápido cumple con todo,0
"(Not enough power for even common tasks.): The track pad is placed just so that every time my hand goes up to type or brushes and the text cursor jumps. Not to mention how google docs needs time to load.It needs to be wider with more ram. Perhaps years ago this would have been a good product, but it’s just underpowered for virtually anything now.",0
"when you turn the volume above 35%, the left speaker will be very noisy such as a broken sound",0
"It runs hot, like you'd expect a thin gaming laptop to, and so expect loud fan noises while gaming",0
"(Good computer for the price.): I was worried about the battery life because of the reviews. However, I haven't had any disappoint with the battery.",0
"(Economical): I'm not very tech savvy so I just like to open the thing and have it work and then don't do too much more than check accounts and social media and shopping. So I bought something from Target for like $200 and just could not get it to work or connect with a network and returned it the next day. This is a pricier unit obviously, but you still need to spend a certain amount to get anything more than a typewriter. I've always had success with Dell and there's nothing to figure out after you turn it on. Sure I'd love to spend a few thousand to be in the Jobs cult, but that seems like overkill to write a couple of book reviews and order a new pair of boots for work.",0
(Exactly what I ordered.): Arrived perfect! Exactly what I expected.,0
"(Excelente compra!!): Compré esta laptop para jugar y trabajar, tengo poco mas de un mes usándola y la pantalla es super buena, todos los juegos que he probado van super bien, jugando a 1080p con los graficos en muy alto, cuando jueguen les recomiendo activar el modo turbo de los ventiladores, hacen ruido en este modo pero ayuda mucho con la temperatura, eso con respecto a juegos, con el trabajo yo trabajo como animador 2D para TV y uso After Effect y es un programa muy exigente, para proyectos simples no hay problema, pero para proyectos grandes a máxima calidad en en el programa la memoria RAM se queda corta, pero le compraré más, pero para cualquier otro tipo de trabajo funciona excelentemente, En verdad se las recomiendo, y si la quieres principalmente para jugar es una muy buena compra. :D",0
(Good): This was easy to set up and it is easy to use. It has been reliable and I am happy with it.,0
"(It's amazing for its price.): Slightly hard to find recommended upgrades (e.g. better battery / SSD or ram)When plugged to power, it is possible to play Cyberpunk 2077, Doom Eternal and other games on beautiful graphics and nice framerate.Generally I am very pleased.Only problem I discovered recently is something with the screen itself. It kinda shows only when the screen is black.small red and blue dots show... slightly noticeable but at least not too much",0
"(Excited at first but that quickly changed!): Not great for streaming, ok for internet browsing. Only had this for about a month and it's freezing up quite a bit. Ctrl Alt delete doesn't seem to work well at all.",0
It is blazing fast with the intel 720p 512GB and a 2tb for mass storage.,0

(Great deal.): Good quality and fast.,0
(not good...): NOT GOOD,0
(UPDATE....bought new and it won't turn on or charge after 5 months...now it does..see my method of fixing below): I really liked this product until just now...I bought it only 5 months ago and it suddenly won't charge or turn on...I was shocked to see I had only purchase it 5 months ago. I will let it sit for a week and see if it'll start later..if it does I will update this review. I have had a different chromebook for at least 3 years and it's still working. I did like the HP because it had a touchscreen which made it nice for my young daughter to do school lessonsUPDATE...so it wouldn't charge or do anything..backscreen..but I still saw a red light near charging spot..so I just put it in my closet for a few weeks or so..let it totally drain until I saw no light at the charing hole...I plugged it in and sure enough it turned on..good as new...I gues this is an old fashined reboot..luckily i had my old good chromebook of another brand that is sill going strong strong...but I'm happy it's working again..I've had several other devices through the years that I've fixed the same way :) hope this helps some people cuz I see many others with the same issue,0
(Get the upgraded version): The chrome book is very basic. Can not play simple kids games like Roblox etc,0
"(Touchpad is VERY GLITCHY; Screen is glitchy; all else is great.): In my recent quest to find a good laptop for my work, I have tried about 8 different ones (I have tried 5 different Asus laptops - Vivobooks and Zenbooks) ad found every Asus laptop to be glitchy.Seriously, I wonder why the hell can Asus not build a laptop that is not so glitchy. Feels like an amateur built them. Touchpad glitches are very common with Asus laptops and on this laptop, the screen also flashes red/blue suddenly and then disappears.So why did I try so many Asus laptops if they're super glitchy? Because everything else about them is perfect - the screen size, the SSD, the matte finish, speakers, and the super quiet fan noise... I was hoping that I'd find one without a glitch, but that hasn't happened yet... each one of the Asus laptops glitched in some way.",0

"It is also surprisingly easy to write on, the pen has a feel almost like writing on paper with a little bit of grab so the pen is not just sliding.",0
"(but if you want to keep the space of SSD to yourself and not to crap windows installs): I installed Ubuntu 16 LTS on it and worked well. I decided to stick with Linux Elementary OS based on Ubuntu 16 LTS. So, hardware on it works well with Linux.It comes with windows, but if you want to keep the space of SSD to yourself and not to crap windows installs, then Linux would work well.I don't even have swap file defined, because 8GB of RAM is plenty for basic work.

"(Overall, a pretty good laptop): I've been using this laptop for almost a year now. I am pretty happy with it, overall. The touchpad is really finicky, some days it works great and some days it shudders constantly. The power supply is big and bulky. What good is a portable laptop with a non-portable power supply.Otherwise, it is fast, stays cool, and has a nice screen ( I did not want a touch screen, so I had to get the only non-touch option). Battery life is pretty good, even when running heavy-duty engineering software.",0
(Great condition): Great condition!,0
(Great for kids): Great for kids in school,0

"(Very Good PC): Runs like a dream, I bought it for portability, My Acer 17 inch i7 is great but too big to move. what shoked me is this seems faster than the Acer, exept for real heavy work you could not do better than buy this PC, as always though Microsoft ruck you for anoter 100 dollers to get Pro without which you cannot use the Bitlocker.",0
(Touch screen!): This little HP Pavilion works wonderful. The size is a touch smaller than my previous laptop and I actually like it much better. Very convenient and working great!,0
"(Superior Laptop): Of all the laptops I have had over the years, the Mac Air 2022 is far superior to all of them. I wouldn’t expect anything less from Apple, a highly respected name. The touch of the keypad is perfect. Everything about this laptop makes it well worth the price.",0
the keyboard lighting doesn’t work properly,0
(Good value for performance): Great value to performance cost compared to other laptops. Has plenty of room to expand storage. Only dislike is the cover shows every fingerprint but you can live with that.,0
(as expected): i used this to drive a digical sign,0
"(Terrible trackpad): It's a great laptop but for one major issue. The trackpad will work fine for a while, then it will stop responding, or get slow, or move the cursor back and forth by itself. I hope they come out with an update. This is a really bad problem.",0
(Poor quality): I bought this laptop a year ago and its been very frustrating. The USB doesn’t work and it keeps logging off the internet. I tried resetting it multiple times and it goes back to the same issues,0
"I had instances where the laptop overheated while playing ""Overwatch"" and I checked the temperature via Armoury Crate and it was at 94% and the laptop itself was very hot when I touched it.",0
(Four Stars): so far so good,0
"(So far it's just ""okay.""): I have a laptop already, but I want to be able to game, edit videos and photography, etc on it. So I got this one here. I think this laptop is pretty good as I like Lenovo, but I might return it. But wait, it's good but you are going to return it? Read on...So I realize now that the screen is a bit small for gaming and the keyboard just doesn't feel very good on my fingers. In addition to that it has blue screened on me a few times when adding my n52te gaming keypad which I happen to use exclusively for playing FPS. Simply plugging it in, blue-screen of death right away. Once it restarts its fine though. The fan got pretty loud while playing CSGO and TF2, which I don't think are even some of the newer games, so it is worth noting that. If its grinding on those, image Fortnite!I'm not sure what to go with I return this one as Lenovo (IBM Thinkpad historically) were always my favorite and most reliable machines. But I do want at a minimum a larger screen. Note that you can add an external screen, but I haven't done that as my gaming station is not yet complete. It is currently on the dining table. LOL. But still, I want the laptop to be able to stand on its own as a gaming system independent of any peripherals such as an external monitor.In summary, I think its okay, but I also think I can do better.",0
"(Good for everything else, battery life not so great.): Just like most other people are saying, the battery life is not the greatest. Plugged in, everything else is good. Remember to put the GPU in eco mode or use integrated graphics if you're not gaming on battery.",0
(Great Laptop): Does every thing i wanted once i took it to windows 10 home,0
"(It's OK for what it costs.): I bought this, and a few spares, for a 'don't care what happens to it' laptop for road trips, gifts, etc.I want it to surf, play netflix, and update my social status while travelling.It does this. Much better than the Dell Crap-top I tried first (Inspiron 14"" something).Sure you gotta navigate the Android enviro... but it seems to be much faster and stable than Win10.If you want a GOOD laptop, get a Dell XPS13 when on sale.If you need a crap-top, this is fine.",0
"(2022 Apple MacBook Air Laptop with M2 chip: 13.6-inc): Real to it image. Performance appears to excellent. Being a first time user , it’s not a complicated to navigate as I thought. It’s just different. You can get use to it quickly and easily just practice.",0

"(Don’t waste your money!!!): We decided to buy this chrome book for my daughter when school closed and she had to do virtual learning.Here we are only a year and a half later, and the computer is completely dead. No power can be put in to it. I have taken it to a computer repair place and they said the computer can not be fixed. Only a year and a half old!! Do not waste you money!!!",0

LOOK NO FURTHER...,0
"(The slowest computer I've ever owned.): This is the worst new computer I've ever purchased. I gave it 2 stars because I guess I need to leave room at the bottom for a computer that doesn't even power up. When on the internet I literally type a sentence then watch as it slowly appears, letter by letter on my screen. If I reboot it goes away for a while. I reboot about 3 times a day.",0
"(Get what you pay for, Good PC): Great laptop for the money. Some licensed items have to be purchased separately, due to user need. Processor is slower than expected, but still good PC.",0
"(To start off with, let me tell you… “WHAT A MACHINE”): Absolutely impressed so far.I got this laptop 10 days ago. Been testing and running every app I require for gaming and doing my work. And it has been flawless. **RTX 2070 graphics at this price is a great deal**Pros:? Screen: For those of you who haven’t used a 144hz screen, you will not be disappointed.? Graphics: RTX 2070 and i7 … WOW? Design & build quality: o RGB Keyboard, the lighting has different modes. The keys are really smooth and I like the font of the letters on the keyboard. It has a number pad too (really wanted that). o The screen is bright enough. o The aluminum finish looks and feels nice. It’s strong and well made. o The track pad works well. o NO HEATING UP ISSUES (MAJOR PRO).Incase it heats up, the ‘cooler boost’ does its job well.? Weight: Not heavy compared to other gaming laptop. Makes it much easier to take it around.? Gaming: I mostly use this laptop to play Steam games like Counter Strike, Rust etc and it is super smooth.? Work: I also get my graphic design and video editing works done and the super-fast response whilerendering my work is amazingly helpful.. saves a lot of time to be honest.Cons ( but not so bad ):? Battery: Battery life is not great. It last only for 2 – 3 hours, but I always use it while its plugged in.? Charger Port: The charger port is placed in a weird spot. Like its right in the middle , gets in the way of the mouse sometimes.? Speakers: The integrated speaker sound is barely audible, but since I use a headset it’s not much of an issue.? Fans: The fans get loud while playing games, ( headset solves the issue for me , AGAIN ).? Aluminium finish: The aluminum finish gets fingerprints easily, so got to keep cleaning with a fiber cloth.Overall:Pretty Impressed and quite happy with my purchase so far. Since I tend to use my laptops for both work and personal use, I use the laptop for almost the entire day and so far I’m loving everything about the MSI GL65 Leopard.At this price I don't think you can get a better machine than this gem. This is by far the best choice for a mid-range gaming laptop.Thank you MSI/Amazon for this amazing deal!",0

"(Do NOT buy this laptop, or Any Asus laptops! The company is ripping off consumers!): 3/17/2018: Update after sending my notebook to Asus under RMA. Asus has refused to repair my notebook and tried to bill me a for a new unit. A technician at Asus damaged my notebook and they are blaming it on me. I escalated to top management and was told they would provide me a 20% discount to buy another one! Unbelievable, but this tells me the current Asus management is out to rip off people! do NOT buy their products!2/25/2019: After using this laptop for a few weeks, the laptop has failed to power on, just out if the blue. I was recovering Windows, it hung, I pressed the power button for 4 seconds (to force power off). The laptop shut down, but will not restart no matter what I do. It is going back to Asus for RMA.After reviewing many, many laptops, I decided in the SCAR 2 updated with RTX. Keyboard is a real one, not a super flat rediclous, plastic chicklet you get on other notebooks.However, unlike the last generation, this units came with a single 16 GB DIMM (not dual channel config) and a super slow Intel 660 SSD! Unbelievelable! A super fast gaming rig and Asus went cheap on the SSD! Buy expecting to fix this.",0
"(looks good and it is blazing fast.. takes 3 seconds to boot up.. it is incredible..): Just got this computer 3 days ago.. it's blazing fast, feels solid and looks good.. the aluminum body gives it a premium feel and I love it..so far everything is working as it should.. battery seems to last a lot, but probably because i'm comparing to my 6 years old laptop that had only like an hour o so.. anyway, I'm very happy with my purchase and recommends to anyone looking for a new ultrabook..",0

I'm currently using it in a nursing program, where I take exams online. It hasn't lagged or frozen during my exams, yet. Hopefully it'll stay like this for the next 2 years. I don't do anything else on it except for school related stuff, and it is runs good enough for my needs.",0

"(Rolling Back to Windows 10 Isn't Quite Easy): This laptop usually comes stock with Windows 10 but it seems someone decided to ""upgrade"" these to Windows 11. This means that you can't roll it back to 10 by the time you get it (because obviously the 10 days have expired) and if you try to do a clean install of Windows 11, the touchpad will stop working. What fixed this for me was going into optional updates and something being there that said to download if you're experiencing certain issues with devices and such. I hate what they did as the customer should have got to choose whether or not to do the free ""upgrade"" and not have this preinstalled.",0
"(Affordable, excellent gaming laptop): This lap top is a replacement for an older alien ware desktop- and it is fantastic. On a game like DRG or DOOM, frame rates run about 170 fps, it has a cooling boost, so it does not have the heat issues that many are reporting with gaming laptops. I added a cooling pad just in case, but it runs fine without it. Colors are beautiful and even the web cam is tolerable. I think the sound is quite adequate, with headphones I am shocked how much more of the sound score I can hear. This unit is a fantastic value and highly recommended!",0
(Good value just not for me): Not good for gaming would not play space engineers stream,0
(Good Buy): Fast start up and good speakers.,0
"(Decent budget laptop): Overall this is a good laptop, I use it as my daily driver + some light gaming, and everything is smooth. You can feel very little warm above the keyboard area when watching live stream or gaming in auto mode and the fan noise is low, I would say the thermal is good. Battery life is about 4 hours when watching live stream.Pros:1. Nice build quality and clean look.2. Has a num pad.3. Screen is decent.4. RAM & SSD are easily upgradable + secondary SSD slot is available.5. Fast CPU, decent thermal, and low fan noise.6. Power & most of I/O ports are at the back, and there is one USB port at both sides.Cons:1. Need some time to get used to the keyboard. I kept hitting the num pad when trying to hit the back space.2. Location of e-support sticker at the left palm resting area can be annoying.3. Could be heavy for some people.4. GPU is not the latest & greatest if you are looking for RTX.",0
(Happy with the purchase): Happy with the purchase and would make a recommendation to anyone.,0
"(Great laptop, just three items could have made it 5 star.): This is a great little laptop with lots of power for the price. Gen 11 i7, an RTX 3060, Thunderport 4, and a very bright 144 Hz display. But there are plenty of reviews that will list out all the wonderful specs. Here are my only complaints. I do have some light bleed around the top and bottom edges of the screen which is disappointing. It is hard to find the battery specs on this laptop but I think it is something like 59 MAH. You you pack this much horse power in a chasey I wish it contained a max 99 MAH battery. There is an extra 2.5"" drive bay next to the battery, it would be awesome to offer a bigger battery option at the sacrifice of the drive bay. Lastly, a MUX switch would have been great. I understand this would add to the cost but I would pay extra for those options and a MUX switch it relatively cheap to build into a laptop. Other than that, I researched close to 30 laptops before settling on this one and it did not disappoint.",0
(TRUE): The laptop is pretty laptop. For the specs you pay for you get a good deal and it is a pretty good slick desgin. I want to put it out there I just got it. But from using it it's pretty nice. If you got the money do it and like to play games I guess I will edit it once I play a game. The game I will be playing is rust.,0
"(It's grown on me): I wasn't too thrilled at first but after getting used to it I've come to like it. It's really too big and heavy to be considered a tablet, and the somewhat condensed keyboard takes some getting used to, but it's been reliable",0

(For student): It seems enough for the secondary student ‘s daily usage. If add the Ram up to 8 or 12GB will be much more better.,0
"(Not for photo editing): This is a high functioning little laptop. However, in researching this model it stated this was a great model for photo editing. That is not true at all!!!! I am extremely disappointed in this computer. I shot photos in RAW and you can't even get the entire Photoshop display in the window. Nor can you easily move it back and forth. I thought I was having issues with Photoshop because I couldn't get all of the functions to show up. Today (after 4 months of playing with it) I discovered that it wasn't Photoshop but my computer that didn't show all the panels of photoshop. There aren't enough ports on the computer for downloading photos are working with the photos. I called Dell and asked which monitor and docking station was recommended for this computer. You can't use the monitor without the docking station. The docking station they recommended only makes the computer jam. So basically the only reason for my purchase is a complete bust. I have a $1700 dust collector. I thought Dell was the best, this frustrating experience has proven otherwise.",0

I will keep learning because there are so many good things about Apple, I've just scratched the surface. No matter how long you've used a PC, if you choose a Mac, you'll never go back!",0
"(Really?): So this is what happen to my purchase. The first day I received it the box look like it seen hell, but I ignore it and give Amazon and Acer a second change. The third day, the blue screen of death pop up. Needless to said I will never buy anything from Acer again.",0
(Great Laptop): This laptop is amazing and well worth the buy. Its great for everything from casual everyday stuff to high end gaming.,0
(GReat): Does everything a laptop needs too and for 1/5 price,0
"(Affordable, refurbished, as ordered.): Arrived in perfect (refurbished) condition. No scratches dents or dings,brand new charger. Charges fast. I get about 5 1/2 hours battery on it (without power saving mode). I didn't need anything fancy. I just do a lot of work on my computers. It works as expected.",0
"(great! fast, responsive, and intuitive (this is coming from a Mac person)): First and foremost- we mainly use Macs/Apple but a few of our family members game frequently (which is definitely not something Apple's are known for being any good at) and my husband is an Android/Windows developer, so we have several Windows machines around, including one he built specifically for gaming last year. So while I'm an Apple expert of sorts, Windows boxes are still a bit foreign to me.However, this laptop make me feel like I'm very adept at both systems. This laptop is mainly used for gaming and development, and it's great. Beautiful display (a bit small- if you are expecting some giant screen, this is not it), very fast response, and the machine and system itself if intuitive and not hard to ""pick up on"" if this might be your first Windows machine.I'm going to be honest- I'm not an expert by any means on Windows laptops so the specs don't mean much coming from me. All I know is that I have played a lot of Steam games (stuff like No Man's Sky, Subnautica, etc.) on our other Windows box which was built and designed specifically for gaming and this laptop is comparable, at the very least. I am super impressed. The speed, the display, the response... it definitely has created an immersive experience for me, and I LOVE that I am not tethered to the TV and the giant PC on the floor anymore when it comes to gaming.I have to admit, I have been hesitant to invest in VR beyond what we have for the Playstation, but now with this laptop I am all set to do that because I have absolutely no doubt whatever VR we invest in will work GREAT with this machine and it makes the VR useable in any part of the house.Totally recommend, even if you've never had a Windows machine before and/or are looking for something to buy specifically for gaming (and probably graphic design, as well since that requires a lot of resources and power...) and need to make the switch.",0
"(Solid, general-purpose laptop with decent battery life. Inferior, dull screen): I have been in the professional IT industry for over 18 years and tinker with technology all the time for both work and fun. I am an enthusiast through-and-through who likes to explore the latest in the industry. For this particular review of the Acer Aspire 5 (2021), my extensive experience with Android, Apple iOS, and Windows phones and tablets will lend a helping hand in understanding what this laptop may or may not be suitable for. I had also recently reviewed a HP Chromebook 14 and will provide some comparisons for those of you considering Google’s ChromeOS laptops.IN A NUTSHELLThis 2021 Acer laptop (A515-56-36UT/ NX.AASAA.001) with Intel’s latest Core i3-1115G4 processor is a solid, general-purpose laptop with a decent battery life of about 6-8 hours, depending on what you do with it. It handled office type work and internet browsing very well (as expected in today’s computing), but struggled with heavy photo or video editing with long delays. Intel’s Core i3 processor is not meant for performance but makes up for it with great battery life.HARDWARE DESIGNIts exterior design is very minimalist, slim (0.7″) and light enough (4 lbs) to hold one handed, but unlike the Microsoft Surface Pro, your arms will eventually tire out. The lid can be opened with one hand with very little flex, but the screen itself has a disappointing viewing angle. You must be at a precise height to see most of the 15.6″ display well enough, but the top and bottom edges were fading towards the darker side with washed-out colors no matter where I positioned my eyes. Expect no vibrant screen even at its brightest setting. Mind you, I am used to much more expensive laptops and external monitors with amazing viewing angles, and for an Acer laptop in this price range, I should not hold it to the same standard. Furthermore, the Acer’s body is essentially plastic all around (with the lid being made of aluminum) and certainly will not scream “premium”.PERFORMANCEThe memory and storage can both be upgraded thanks to an extra RAM and 2.5″ SATA drive slots. You can achieve significantly more performance by upgrading the included 4GB memory with an additional 4GB (up to 16GB) stick (for a total of 8-20GB). I suggest you get one from Crucial, Kingston, Samsung, Micron, or Hynix by searching for “DDR4 SODIMM” (either 2666 or faster 3200). Upgrading is a simple matter of powering off the laptop, removing the battery, touching a grounded metal to remove static from your body, then opening the screws at the bottom of the laptop, and carefully inserting the new part(s) without any force.Intel’s Core i3-1115G4 processor is dual-core to allow for multiple applications to run more efficiently (and it does so significantly faster than its predecessors), and the built-in Intel UHD G4 graphics processor is capable of light, casual gaming, including Grand Theft Auto 5 at 1920×1080, 30-50 FPS, and Normal detail settings. That’s pretty impressive for a budget processor! This means that gaming was possible with League of Legends, Fortnite, NBA 2K21, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Minecraft, and even Battlefield 1.Wireless performance was in line with expectations, and if you have a WiFi 6 capable router, this machine zips along a tad faster than with older routers. Its 128GB NVMe SSD flash drive (made by Samsung in my unit) ensures fast retrieval and writing of data to long-term storage and scoffs at lower-priced laptops that still use the really slow eMMC drives.Speaker volume and output is as expected for a laptop of this class: tinny and just loud enough to comfortably watch a movie with in a small, quiet room. Typing and using the touchpad felt natural, though some extended keys were not where standard-sized keyboards would have them — a common problem for more compact laptops. I was disappointed to see Acer ship the laptop with a proprietary barrel plug instead of using USB-C.OPERATING SYSTEMWindows S is included — a version of Microsoft’s operating system that promised more secure, faster, reliable computing in its bid to compete against Chromebooks. Microsoft had previously tried with the ill-received Windows RT, and like that one, Windows S had also become a failure in that the market still is not ready to give up the compatibility to run legacy applications that Windows had been known for. Thankfully, there is an easy, one-way to upgrade to the full Windows 10 Home experience for free.Compared to a Chromebook, I much prefer this Acer because it comes with full computing functionality. Chromebook had been doing very well in the education sector, but nothing compares to having the flexibility to run and do anything with your laptop that runs a full version of Windows. So, although Chromebook excels in all-day battery life (10+ hours), I would pick this Acer over it despite the slightly higher price.I am a huge supporter of the Microsoft Surface Pro, Surface 3, and Surface Go type form factor. However, one of their biggest disadvantages is that they are not entirely comfortable to use on your lap as their kickstands dig into your skin. That is where laptops excel: sitting comfortably on your lap — that is, if you can withstand the heat that some powerhouse computers put out. Thankfully, this Acer does not create too high of a heat due to its use of Intel’s lower-powered Core i3 processor.Alexa worked fine out of the box and is more preferred over Microsoft’s own Cortana voice assistant. I turned it off, though, since Alexa annoys my family and I at times with its wildly inaccurate results to our questions when compared to Google’s Assistant. Still, Alexa is a good option over Cortana.A brief guide was included in the package, and the full manual can be found online on Acer’s website.OVERALL IMPRESSIONThis Acer Aspire 5 makes for a great, day-to-day, no-frills computer for casual work, web browsing, media consumption, gaming, and Windows Store app usage. I just wished the display was much better, but what can you expect at this price? It makes for a great, inexpensive travel laptop that I would not shed a tear for if it broke or got stolen — just make sure you enable drive encryption so thieves cannot get to your data.PROS- Good, general-purpose performance- Great battery life- Inexpensive- Slim and lightweight- Upgradeable memory and storageCONS- Washed-out, dull display- Low performance (not suitable for heavy photo, video editing)- Proprietary AC wall charger- Plastic body- Tinny speakersREFERENCESRead on to learn more about what CPUs, WiFi 6, and Chromebooks are.WHAT IS AN INTEL PROCESSOR?The CPU (processor), the “brain” of a computer, is an important piece to gauge performance. It is responsible for processing all the general calculations and instructions to carry out everything an electronic device can do. The faster it can “think”, the faster things will get done.Intel has maintained a significant lead in the computer industry with only AMD having been its noteworthy rival for decades. AMD had actually made a significant comeback with its Ryzen product line to compete against Intel’s flagship “Core”. The numbering scheme for Intel goes like this (from lowest to highest performance): i3, i5, i7, and i9. AMD’s Ryzen series mirrors that. Essentially Intel’s Core i3 is the least expensive and targets consumers wanting a basic computer to do basic things like web browsing, office work, media consumption, and casual gaming with better battery life than the higher models. Core i7 and i9 target hardcore users who want top-notch performance.WHAT IS WIFI 6?The new WiFi standard is not just about speed. It can more efficiently send data to multiple devices at once (like a delivery driver stopping by multiple clients on the way to the final customer), improve battery life, and security. However, the router and devices must all support the new 802.11ax standard for the benefits to be realized.WiFi 6 is 100% backwards compatible with WiFi 5 and older devices and as such is more future proof.WHAT IS A CHROMEBOOK?It is important to first and foremost understand that Chromebook is precisely that — a laptop (notebook) based on Google’s Chrome operating system (OS), software that allows you to use and interact with the hardware. It offers a minimalistic, web browser experience that is far different from Windows and MacOS, but may appear familiar to Android users.Newer Chromebooks offer the Google Play Store from which you can download apps, games, and consume books, music, and movies — just like a Samsung smartphone or Google TV device. It also offers apps from the Google Chrome Web Store that are very limited in functionality but can enhance the web browsing experience with extensions (plugins).Chrome OS is today’s dominant computing system used within the Education market, an area that Microsoft had been trying to challenge with its failed Windows RT and Windows S-Mode efforts. Apple, too, trails behind Google’s Chromebook platform. Unlike Windows and MacOS native programs, however, most web apps within Chrome OS cannot be used without having internet access. A subset and many Google Play Store apps can, such as Netflix and Gmail.In Short: Chrome OS, which was launched in 2011, very much feels like an Android tablet slapped onto a laptop form factor. It does not offer a full PC/Mac experience and essentially is a (usually) low-cost/low-powered computer whose main interface is the Google Chrome web browser.I much prefer a Windows laptop over Chrome OS for everyday computing (like this Acer Aspire 5 or Microsoft Surface Go 2), even if I had to pay a bit more for that flexibility. However, the education sector does prefer the latter like the one that powers the HP Chromebook 14.",0
(Hardware is solid): So when I received the computer I got started downloading everything playing some games and stuff. I noticed the screen acting weird and next day the screen is going in and out of working. It took 2 days for my screen to not work. The hardware in this laptop is great. But the quality of the build is why the price is good for this laptop. Screen is really flimsy and if you want to carry this in my backpack. I wouldn’t do it because it’s gonna flex. I ended up returning this because I just don’t want to deal with this issue at all in the future.,0
"(Bang for your buck): Best bang for your buck. Unit boots up in SECONDS. Screen is really nice, very pleasant for gaming and editing media. Battery life is approximately 3 hours IF you’re just browsing the internet, using light apps, streaming video, etc. My only gripe is that I assumed the 8750H would be more powerful (it’s not bad by any means, just expected better) but i can run most games at high-ultra and get some serious frames as this is the full 1060 6gb and not the max Q version. No frame-drop issues so far but i usually use the fan controller program that’s preinstalled and keep it on max as this unit does get pretty warm (it’s a gaming laptop, duh?). Acer hit the mark with this one. if you have $1100 laying around and want to get a solid gaming laptop, I highly recommend it.",0
"(Great little laptop!): Love this little laptop! I was looking for a lightweight, travel friendly, fast, and intuitive little laptop to use during an extended 7-month backpacking trip across New Zealand. The Samsung Chromebook 3 is exactly that, without compromising battery life, functionality, or overall quality of hardware/materials. It’s a solid little computer and weighs so little it’s impressive. Fantastic internet connectivity, breezy user interface. Very simple but does its job very well. As always, Samsung makes another fantastic product (and I’ve been an Apple fan for as long as I can remember). Overall, at this price point, you can’t find a better little laptop. Inexpensive, efficient, super portable, and works like a charm. Very happy with my purchase.",0

"(Great value): I got this for my son who is really into gaming. His previous gaming laptop was a much more expensive one by Alienware. However it’s about 4 years old and he has been having some issues with it lately. Obviously it wouldn’t be fair to compare this Levovo Legion 5 at just over a grand to a nearly 3 grand Alienware laptop though, so I’ll keep the comparisons to a minimum.As far as picture quality, it’s pretty good, though not amazing either. You can definitely get by with it alone though and it’s pretty much what I would expect from a gaming laptop in this price range. Though my son hooks his up to a really nice gaming monitor so it’s not an issue for us either.Now forewarning, Im sort of repeating what my son is telling me about this as I don’t know a ton about gaming laptops. My son did say that it works fine for almost all of the games he plays, and really that there were only very small differences in how well the games played compared to this laptop and the Alienware one. He said he was surprised as he expected worse from this. He also said that this lacked a lot of the customizing you can do on the higher end laptops, smaller things that are more personal preference really.The keyboard has a ton of customization in terms of colors and what not, though most gaming laptops have this these days, so nothing special. He rated the keyboard a 4/5. He says the keys are a bit less clicky than he usually likes, but it’s still smooth and he can feel when the key is pressed.Size wise it’s not as heavy as his previous Alienware, but it still feels solid and well built. And even after an hours long gaming session he doesn’t feel the laptop gets to hot, and that he actually feels it’s cooling system is better than his Alienware.Overall, for the price point this is a solid gaming laptop. It’s the best you can get right now for under $1,500. And it’s probably the best you can get that actually performs well with most games without paying significantly more money.",0
"(Not a high performance laptop.): I'm not sure I can even keep this computer. I'm an architect, and need to run high performance programs like Revit. Do NOT recommend. The computer won't even open Revit sometimes, and it keeps crashing even though it says the graphics drivers are completely up to date.The keyboard is off-center because of an unnecessary number key pad, and the track pad gets in the way of typing.Also design is cheezy with chamfered corners.",0
"(Yep - it's fast): Coming from a desktop rig I built in 2019 (ryzen 7 3700x, rtx 2070 super, 32gb ram) this thing annihilates it in gaming. Some initial thoughts after playing with it for a few hours tonight:- Build quality is good. It's no Macbook but feels premium for a Windows laptop. Not a fan of all the RGB lighting, though I'm just using this plugged in as a desktop replacement. Luckily nobody will witness me lit up like a Christmas tree.- The included ROG software is easy to use. Some useful physical hot-keys allow you to quickly switch between the different power modes (Silent? No way, give me Turbo!) Enabling the MUX switch is simple through the ROG software (and does require a restart)- Tested Battlefield 5 and Halo Infinite. Laptop handled both like it was nothing (consistent 100+ FPS in both with mixture of med/high settings, didn't try to push it as I prefer performance over fidelity.) I'll have to test some more demanding games, but between those too I see significantly better performance than I did on my old desktop.- FHD screen not a big deal personally, picture looks good and buttery smooth with that high refresh rate.- In turbo mode the fan does get really loud, and I can definitely feel a decent amount of hot air blowing out onto my mouse hand. Will be nice in the winter.Thing is a beast for the price. The fact that it can outperform desktop gaming rigs of respectable calibre is stunning for a laptop. Excited to put it through more rigor, which I feel confident it will be able to handle very well",0
"(Wifi connectivity sucks!): Without Wifi connectivity it's not worth it. The Wifi keeps on disconnecting, and it's super frustrating. I don't even use it so heavily. I have it for a little over a year. It's not worth the money for such a short time plus it wasn't working properly after a few months!",0
(Get What you pay for..): Not happy with it. Spend the extra money and get the touchscreen. Feels too boxy and simple for 2020 but you get what you pay for.,0

Low amount of storage that is eaten up in no time by Microsoft Windows updates and various other Microsoft bloatware, can't seem to install anything because it has such low storage, if you do happen to install an application, good luck getting it to run properly. Terrible! Do not buy!",0
"(Great PC): 17"" screen looks biggerWorks great",0
"(Best Value Ultrabook): This laptop is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I needed something that was light, sturdy, portable, fast, and good on battery life.Build:This laptop is sturdy with hardly any flex to be found. The exterior of the laptop is metal and looks quite nice. The inside is a premium grade plastic. The laptop is extremely solid when closes and I have no worries throwing it into my backpack. It is extremely light and hardly noticeable on my back. The keyboard is surprisingly nice to use (I had expected it to be bad, but boy was I wrong).Screen: The 13 inch ultrabook screen size is perfect. I used to have a 17 inch display but I do not miss it after having the portability of the 13. I do not have any trouble reading the display. The display gets plenty bright for me in nearly every condition. It is sharp and just all around good looking.Battery: This batter lasts far longer than I ever expected it to. Even on the highest performance settings, I can expect it to last about 4 hours. By turning down the brightness of the keyboard and screen, I can get easily over 9 hours of continuous use of of this thing.Speed: Make sure to get the Intel 8th gen chip. Do not settle for the 7th gen or anything less. The 8th is at least a 40% improvement over the 7 and it shows. This thing is lightning fast. It holds many chrome tabs and programs with ease. I have absolutely no problems with the speed of this device (and I am very picky).Price: Anything cheaper than this will have a significant drop in reliability and build quality. You can get other laptops for cheaper, but I wouldn't. After examining many of its competitors (Dell XPS 13, HP Envy, etc.), I can truly say that this is the best value. Other well known ultrabooks do a fantastic job and may improve slightly over this device, but it will come at a much greater cost.Gaming: Extremely light gaming is doable on this laptop but that is definitely not it's intended purpose. If you expect this to be your main computer as a gamer, you should look elsewhere. Ultrabooks just aren't made for that. You will still need to invest in something with a dedicated graphics card and an i7. I use this laptop when I am away from my gaming desktop.",0
"(Awful speakers): I'm shocked at how bad the speakers are. As the laptop is idling, we cannot hear *anything* from the speakers until the volume is at about 31% and during gaming the audio is barely audible at 100%. The speakers are so weak, I'm wondering if I have a lemon...",0
"(Is a good gaming laptop. But the QC is bad): It is a beast for gaming. With i9 12gen CPU. And 3070Ti.Note that it is a i9 inside a laptop. This laptop run with 70degree C just 2min after turn on the laptop without doing anything.And when gaming the fan is loud. able to keep the CPU to NOT thermal throttle. So I recommend to have a headphone while playing game.My laptop ship with bit defects, the rubber on the base is not balance. Wubbling a lot.If I ship it back for inspection and then wait for refund it need 2months to process, can't wait that long without a laptop, so I have to deal with it.But other then this I am happy with the laptop.",0
"(Good, but I'm changing my rating): Update:The high pitched coil noise the fans make is super annoying. I don't know if mine is special, but it's ridiculous. I really should have sent this back and gotten a prebuilt desktop. Acer. Fix your fans!Original second review:My previous review got deleted somehow. It was very thorough on the pros and cons of this laptop. Short version.CPU gets too hot. Thermal throttles when gaming. It's not constant throttling but periodically the temperature peaks for a second then returns to a more normal range. The new Acer 1.06 bios helped a little. Instead of reaching 212 or more degrees F, it mostly reaches 203 degrees F.The Acer customer service link they give you on a card in the box does not actually work.The fans make a very slight coil whine like noise. Most people probably won't notice, But I do.I got this because of the graphics card drought.",0

"(Excellent Laptop for Live Stream): Due to Covid-19 our church had to start live streaming services. We had never done anything like this so there was a lot to learn. Tried different equipment and methods. Our current setup uses two Mevo Start cameras on NDI going to OBS. The laptop we had was not adequate and had difficulty streaming and with multiple video sources. I got this MSI GL65 Leopard for its 6 CPU cores and RTX2070 graphics. It was also reasonably priced. This laptop handles the streaming nice and smooth. No difficulties working with OBS and various video sources (combinations of NDI streams, HDMI capture, and USB). It just works great. The laptop feels very well built and has very adequate cooling. The fans can get a little loud under heavy load but that does not concern me. Cooling and performance are the top priorities.It has enough USB ports (3 USB 3.2 type-A, 1 USB 3.1 type-C) for my needs, an Ethernet port (so I don't need an adapter) and HDMI for second screen. Also has a power plug, which I prefer over USB-PD.It has actual mouse buttons which I prefer over pressing on the touchpad. It has been running well for almost 6 months now without any issues.",0
"(Slow(er) performance than expected, low(er) volume compared to other units, okay for basic browsing): Purchased this unit because of dissatisfaction with Lenovo Flex 11 which was purchased first. I will post a separate review for the Lenovo Flex. Unfortunately the main positives of this Samsung unit compared to the Lenovo Flex is its 64GB eMMC hard drive (the Flex only has 32GB capacity) and the micro SDHC card slot works (I have a 128GB card inserted which does not stick out but is flush against the side of this unit) whereas I could not successfully insert any SD card into the card reader of the Flex. Also, for the Flex it appeared that any SD card inserted would still have one third to half of the card sticking out which would make it less than ideal as a permanent way to expand it onboard 32GB eMMC memory. The screen on this unit is passable but not as sharp or vivid as the screen on the Flex. The onboard speakers is extremely disappointing. With volume set to 50%, the sound from the Flex is robust and sufficiently loud to watch videos or listen to music without resorting to earphones. However on this Samsung unit, when volume is set at 50%, the sound is faint(er) and less clear. In order to achieve the same audio experience of the Flex, I had to increase the volume to over 80% if I wanted to listen to sounds coming from the speakers. Can’t speak to whether the same problem exists when using earphones as I have not plugged in and used earphones on either units. Overall I am disappointed with the performance of this unit even though it technically “works” and does everything one would expect from a Chromebook. Only reason why I even bothered to buy this unit (and the Lenovo Flex 11 from a different online retailer, the one which ends in egg) is because my Toshiba Chromebook is getting old (but actually performs better than either of these two newer units) and my Google Chromebook Pixel (2013 model) is no longer able to receive the newest Chrome OS updates but also still performs better than either of these two units. Ending on a positive note, the Google Play Store works fine for both this Samsung unit and the Lenovo Flex. Had no problem installing my go-to Android apps onto either unit (e-readers, Chinese dictionary, video players with more features than what Chromebooks can normally do/play). On side note, did have to purchase a cover (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GNE4QMO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) because this Samsung unit felt too flimsy to carry around in my backpack without something to protect it from scratches and nicks. The iPearl mCover hard shell case fits well (even if I do think it’s somewhat pricey for what it is).",0
"(Verys good): Bought it for a cousin of mine and he's on it bout 8-10 hours a day playing games and it does incredible no glitches and it keeps itself cooled off, very good computer highly suggested",0
(Excelente relación precio/calidad): Excelente producto. Muy actualizado con hermoso dise?o y peso muy ligero,0
(Nice laptop): Very nice laptop perfect for what I need and a great value,0
"(Not awful for gaming, good battery): Battery life has been good for me, and overall performance thanks to the 5800H has been great. Advertising it as a ""gaming"" laptop is a bit of a stretch to me though. It can handle most games...at very low settings. Some ""eSports"" titles like CSGO or some MOBAs it can run decently, but for general ""gaming"" it falls on its face a bit. If gaming is something you do on the side and just need a well built all-arounder for a decent price, this is a good option. But if you are looking for a dedicated device for gaming, unless you have low standards I would not bet on this unit. the mobile 3050ti is pretty unpowerful. Probably around 40% slower than its desktop version if I had to guess.",0
"(Great Laptop for uni): Got this laptop for computer science courseWas skeptical about this laptop but im so glad i got it!Zero problems like coil whine etc, for some reason i love the look including the bezel, and actually think it looks much better than the ux430 (my friend has it), performance is great with the 8th gen cpu. I was concernced with the slow ssd but its perfectly adequate!Overall great laptop at a great price",0
"(HP Laptop): HP laptops are always reliable, price at Amazon was good.",0
"(A Good Basic Laptop but Maybe a Bit Over-priced): The Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-36UT Slim Laptop has a pretty plastic casing and feels a little flimsy but it looks sleek and slim and attractive when it shines. This laptop comes with built-in RAM (4 gigs) and a 128 gigs of NVMe SSD but you can upgrade it. I added 16 gigs for a total of 20. There's only one slot for this upgrade but I'm sure you can probably go higher. I also tried to upgrade the storage but it's tricky to move onto a bigger stick and I want to do that, as well as, add a 2tb regular SSD drive along with the NVme SSD. The camera quality is acceptable though not great as is the audio too. This laptop has enough ports for regular usage. What all this says is that this machine can be pimped out with parts that cost much higher than its own value. I've never had issues like this concerning other PC computers outside of Acer but I did resolve this once but never took notes on how I had done it before. All in all it can be a little cheaper for what you get, considering the screen is not the best and a tad dark and dull compared to an HP model I have that is similar. This is not a device that's designed for major gaming though games that don't require major resources can still be used on it. Battery power is reasonable. The bottom line is that this is a good choice for if you're looking for basic computing power and capabilities. I'd particularly recommend it for those with children at home who want a work-horse device for homework and such. While I think that this computer is fine for such purposes I also believe that its price-point is just a bit high for its particular specs for which I'm withholding a star that I'd otherwise give it if it were seventy-five or a hundred dollars cheaper.",0
"(Great for normal uses, poor for gaming and also Sticky keys.): After a month of using this laptop for normal college uses, the keys get stuck which creates the backlight look poor. The keys are still pressable, just the backlight looks horrible.Battery life is okay, lasts about 4 to 5 hours for normal uses and some photo editing. Gaming on this laptop isn't recommended unless you want to always be plugged in. The battery life can range from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours before it states you need to charge",0

"(Great laptop so far, yet battery life if not accurate.): Been using this for college work, regular googling, and a little gaming here and there. The keyboard is nice and I love the look of rgb lights shining underneath. Visuals look good when watching videos or playing a game. My actual only issue with the laptop is the lack of battery life it has. The laptop is listed for up to 5 hours, yet when i checked the hours it has left it always has a max time of 2 hours which is really poor. I could just have a faulty power supply or may not but 2 hours of battery life is really hard to deal with incase you want to use the laptop on the go. Other than battery life the laptop still looks great and works great as well.",0
"(Good computer, but rather heavy): I'm a Mac guy, but I needed a Windows machine with good graphics capabilities. This fits the bill. It's an excellent computer - fast and responsive, and with ample drive space, memory and ports. The primary negative is that it's heavy, and I need to use it as a laptop and travel with it. If it mostly sits on your desk or you just move it at home from one surface to another, then it works very well as a desktop substitute.",0

The fans keep it cool and definitely move some heat - yeah, they are a little loud when they kick on, but it's nothing really bad for what they are doing! I've had MUCH louder laptops!

Primero que nada es una gran frustración haber comprado un producto de este precio para obtener algo defectuoso, sin importar cuán mínima o grande sea la falla. Las únicas opciones que uno tiene al verse en esta situación implican una pérdida de tiempo y son: Devolver el producto o intentar hacer válida la garantía con Asus.

"(Best bank for the buck!): This laptop will shred through any game with the highest settings, though, you won't unlock the full potential of this beast until you plug an external monitor to it, due to Optimus (it bottlenecks the performance from 4% to 50% fps depending on the game title).Here are some benchmarks for some games I played:VALORANT: 220+fps internal monitor/320+ external monitor.CSGO: 250-300+fps internal/400+ external.PUBG: 110-170 fps internal.COD WARZONE: 90-140 fps internal.KILLING FLOOR 2: 120+ highest settings.RESIDENT EVIL 2 REMAKE: 60+ Almost everything Ultra(this game is no joke, it is VRAM hungry as a mf, but very visually stunning)",0
"(Chrome is Golden!): I like my new HP Chromebook 14-ak050nr quite a lot. Yes, it has all the limitations of chromebooks with respect to its own unique operating system, but those limitations are well known. What it does have is a beautiful display with a matt finish, an attractively-styled exterior appearance, good internals, pleasant-sounding speakers, an array of well-positioned ports, and a nice keyboard and trackpad. Taking into account what it offers compared to the competition and its price on Amazon, I think that it is an excellent choice for anyone in the market for a new chromebook. It is the first chromebook that I have ever owned, so I don't have another to compare it with, but I am pleased with my choice and enjoy using the machine. I have never yet called Tech Support at HP, so I can't be of much guidance there as to how helpful they may be in the future in the event of issues that may arise. I am hoping that they are there for us when we need them.",0
"(Terrible everything that could go wrong did battery defective, hardware defective): Terrible",0
it would be nice if the screen could fold back or rotate so it could be used more like a tablet,0

DOES NOT COME WITH THE LIGHT UP NUMBERPAD ON THE TRACKPAD,0
(Good purchase): Great computer… came packaged very nicely. Good purchase.,0
"(What an awesome, light and powerful laptop!): I got this laptop to replace my squeaky HP which became noisy within a relatively short time after I bought it.This laptop is very light and very powerful, just as advertised.It does not have touchscreen capabilities; I guess that would have made it heavier?In any case, I really like the laptop and highly recommend it.",0
"(Some Good, Some Bad, Some Meh.): I've had this laptop for a week now, and while there is much to like, there is also a few things that make me wish I had bought a different machine.PROS: Display is GORGEOUS, and the dedicated graphics handle my current favorite game--FFXIV--at ultra high settings. Boot time is non-existent due to the SSD. The keyboard is a real pleasure to use. It's QUIET and gives good feedback. It's also intelligently laid out. I love that there's a num-pad. Also, aesthetically, the lighting is a lot of fun. I don't usually buy gaming laptops for the bling, but hey ... I'll take bling when it comes my way. It has plenty of ports, and feels solid. I don't feel like it's going to fall apart on me.CONS: The CPU runs HOT. And while this is to be expected when processing a high-graphics, high-input game, the fans are NOISY. The chassis grows hot in the upper margins above the top row of keys (I suspect this is where the CPU is housed), and if you want to keep it cooler, you have to crank the fans waaaay up. The GPU is fine. This pertains only to the CPU. This feeds into the next complaint: The audio for this machine truly sucks. The speakers are located on the bottom of the machine, so with the fan noise and the speaker location all the audio is either inaudible or very muddy. I had to lift the laptop up to make out what someone was saying in a Youtube vid--and the speakers were on high. This is purportedly a gaming laptop, and games have soundtracks that people want to hear. This just feels like they tried to cut corners. Lastly, I had to disable the camera driver. It would switch the camera on and off randomly and in quick succession whenever I'd start up a game.So ... yeah. If you want it for high-end gaming, maybe find a different machine that won't bring you annoyances. If you are playing videos, or listening to music only, or using it for writing, etc, you'll be fine.Five stars for the screen. Three stars for the gaming due to the sound issues, and lack of sluggish cooling for the CPU. I only use it plugged in, so I can't attest to the battery life ... hence four stars.The picture is an example of how high the resolution is in a gaming environment. Sweet stuff.",0
(good battery):,0
"(What a downgrade of SSD): Con: The SSD speed is only 50% of the older M1 MacBook Air. The processor is not sensibly faster than the old one...Pro: New design, light weighted, great screen.",0
(Great Computer): So far it's great! Google Chromebook - that's what it is! Great value.,0
"(Good Laptop/Notebook for the value/but had to wait from distributer): I had to get a new Laptop, after my DELL XPS crapped out on me only after 18 months. Here are the specs of the HP Pavilion 15.6"" laptop 15.6"" HD diagonal HD SVA BrightView micro-edge WLED-backlit touchscreen (1366 x 768)8th Generation Intel Core i5-8250U Processor (1.6GHz, up to 2.7GHz)8GB DDR4-2400 SDRAM, 1TB HDD + 16GB Intel OPtane MemoryHDMI, HD Webcam, B&O PLAY with dual speakers, Intel HD Graphics 620-The reason why I will not give this laptop 5 stars is because HP will charge over $200 for a 16 GB ram upgrade and install and any upgrades are expensive. Now I am basing these ratings off of the entry to mid level basic laptops, you can't compare this to a $2000-3000 gaming laptop like Dell Alienware or MSI or a professional business laptop like an HP Envy DELL XPS or a MACBOOK pro.I recommend that YOU upgrade the slow HD drive and replace it with an SSD drive. I picked up a Samsung 480 GB SSD Drive for $125 with shipping included from Amazon prime and I paid another $70 for 2 8GB DDR 4 ram. The ram can be installed easily, just unscrew the laptop, place the ram in the slot and it should latch on. If you are not tech saavy, take the SSD drive to a PC repair shop and they should do it for around $100.Caveat, if anyone told you the upgraded the CPU or graphics card, they are lying because there are two types of motherboards, the ones that the graphic card and CPU can be replaced and the ones where it is attached, like in this mode. As for the speakers, I like the innovative wavy design, next to the monitor and the speakers are excellent. They are on par with some top of the line models, that can cost $2-3000. The batterylife is solid, I have not fully tested it yet on gaming and movies but seems like on power saver mode or the 20%/80% option, you will get minimum about 5-6 hours of battery life and a bit more, if you are not watching movies or videos.I only had the laptop for less than a month and I have upgraded the ram to 16 gb and replaced the 1TB HD drive with a 480 GB SSD drive. You sacrifice some hard drive space but your notebook will be lightening fast and this smokes my Dell XPS. Other than upgrading the HD drive to SSD drive and get 16 GB of ram, caveat the most this laptop will take is 16 GB and get DDR 4 and switch the drive to a 480 GB SSD drive You can get an SSD drive wieth more memory but then you are spending more money and it does not justify the cost. Overall, this laptop will get the job done for your work and school projects. The added bonus is for under $600, you get an I 5 processor, along with a touch screen and 15.6"".I have two major issues and the first being that the seller is charging $87 for a book, that is not even a hard cover, max this book should be sold is $50. I ordered this for a college class and it arrived late. I would like a refund because i tried calling and nobody answered my # 702-888-0768 my email razmy.s@yahoo.com. I will leave this review until the issue get's resolved to warn others.",0
(On point): Everything on point. Hope it stays that way,0
"(Worst purchase of my life): This computer is easily the worst purchase I have made in my life. Within weeks the cheap quality becomes apparent as the trackpad will start being unresponsive, the screen becomes flimsy, the battery drains, and so much more. To boot, the customer service is horrendous.I sent my computer (under warranty) to be fixed by Acer for the many issues that arise within a year. Be warned of the following:- They will not pay for shipping to their repair center (about $70).- They will likely void your warranty. In my case they stated my computer had ""physical damage"". This physical damage was a small scratch and bend on back cover of the screen (and has nothing to do with the repairs needed).- They will charge you a $386 fee to repair your computer (more than half the price of the computer) and offer no option for refund instead.- The customer service phone line will hang up on you, put you on endless hold, and redirect you in circles to different departments.Do yourself a favor and buy from a better company. I tried finding a cheaper option from my previous Apple and this was the biggest mistake and downgrade I have ever made with a laptop.",0

(It comes with a charger): It's a fast working laptop. Sets itself up when you enter your email. Charges fast. Well organized.,0
"(No keypad or touch screen but my mistake): My bad for ordering. No touch screen, no number keypad but keeping it as a back up",0
the internal 64G EMMC is too limited,0
the keyboard is a little flimsy,0
(Five Stars): Love this computer already! it performs fast and professional for video editing and documentation editing.,0
(Broken): I bought this laptop to upgrade from a desktop Ryzen 5 and 1660 to a Ryzen 9 and 3080. It was a great deal for the money and was great at first. Then it came time to upgrade to Windows 11 and had to restart. As you can see in the video it’s been restarting nonstop and basically broken on Day 1. If someone could help or knows what’s wrong with it or Asus reach out it would be greatly appreciated.,0
(Nice computer): Fast internet connection. Large 15 inch screen. Getting familiar with windows 11. I think I got a good deal for black Friday specials on this computer.,0
"(A.W.E.S.O.M.E.!!): After much research...I'm sooo glad I purchased this Dell chromebook for my 6th grade daughter!! Its the same one they use in her class and she can now research and work/catch up on her school apps, essays, slides etc. It's A.W.E.S.O.M.E. not only the price! ;) Highly recommend!",0

The 144HZ frame rate is butter smooth and totally worth sacrificing a 4K display for.,0
"(6 months and DOA): After 6 month, the unit would not turn on. Batter shows good. Called Dell and they say it is out of warranty and I only had in 5 -1/2 months. Dell will not honor its warranty.",0
"(Was good untill its start crashing): The laptop was great for a year I was loving it, great performance in gaming and overall great performance, but it was getting really hot will playing games, temp around 90-100 temp.After 1 year the lasting start crashing more often during games more than normal. When I tried to talk with MSI support for the item they said the 1 year warranty already passed and beside that we don't have a warranty for your country.So I got stuck with with a laptop that crash a lot in gaming after only 1 year of use.After I speak with amazon the amazing support of amazon decide to give me refund for most of the cost of the laptop, which was really great for them since the amazon warranty is only for 30 days .pros : good gaming exp,cons : getting hot during games , and after 1 year of gaming start crashing will playing games .",0
I love how lightweight it is and it all-around is a very sleek looking laptop.,0
The glass touchpad is the best i ever experianced in Windows operating system,0
"(Worth the money): I bought it because I wanted a very fast laptop for work and everyday activities... that I could take on vacations and play games if I wanted. It handles Sea of Thieves on Mythical graphics no problem. Love the laptop, worth the money...Only issue, I had to get a replacement the first week or so. Because it wouldn’t let me install games from the Microsoft Store to my hard drive. It acted like it didn’t exist. I even reinstalled the OS.So I just sent it back and got a replacement (within 30 days) so I highly recommend making sure it can download games and do everything you want while in your Amazon return window.Side note- will definitely buy more high valued items on Amazon due to their quick shipment of my new laptop.",0

"(Keeping your expectations grounded): This laptop does just fine. My needs are work and gaming. Runs escap form tarkov, insurgency sandstorm on max settings. Although this will run Warzone at an acceptable FPS. If you are looking to play higher demanding games get a desktop. Don't plan on playing games on the battery for to long. I like the numpad, the keyboard is good. The screen looks good. Over all, the was the best choice for me and my needs",0
(Won't disappoint!): This is my third msi gaming laptop over the years and I have absolutely loved each laptop. Every game I have played has looked great and was very smooth. Not to mention it boots up and is ready to use in about 10 seconds.,0
(GreT work): Vreat job,0
"(I love it!!!): Perfect: lovely design, so comfortable in one’s hand. Long, long lasting battery; comfy, responsive keyboard. Apple added the mag safe charging cable which is very welcome. Of all the Macs I’ve owned the MacBook Air with the M2 chip is the best. Super, super light, too.",0
(Worth the price): I was a little scared by the previous reviews on this laptop. But I ordered it anyway. Turns out the product is worth every penny! I am a software developer and I have been able to run all my IDEs with no glitch. I'll definitely recommend this laptop to anyone,0
"(Handles big Triple A games just fine): Great laptop, handles big Triple A games like Call of Duty, New World, Fallout 4, etc. I bought a full sized keyboard, mouse, and a 24 inch monitor to game on with the laptop powering the setup and providing a second monitor for me to watch media.",0
"(Great computer, mold smell): The computer works fine and Im happy with my purchase. The box does smell like mold? I saw other reviewers post prior to purchasing - just thought I’d mention it’s def a thing. No issues with the computer itself so far. I haven’t had it long though.",0
"(Fast and Easy): Fell in love with the chromebook. Was a little skeptical about the CLOUD thing, but there's no question that it gets online quicker. Operating System being designed around the browser or vice-versa is an excellent idea.",0
"(A bit of a sour taste): The computer has excellent hardware. Battery life is one of the downsides as it is surprisingly short. You can't relly on this computer if you plan to use it away from a power source for longer times (3+ hours).The other disappointment for me is the lack of GNU/Linux support. ASUS is considerably behind other companies on that matter. If you live exclusively on GNU/Linux world I would suggest looking into somewhere else (System76 or Purism perhaps). If you must dual boot with Windows, look for Dell or Lenovo.This computer works with Linux. The problem is that some features, such as keyboard shortcuts to control screen brightness and keyboard backlight doesn't work. Actually, the volume control is the only shortcut that works.I've bought this computer because of a deal offer with a very good price. Otherwise, I would probably buy a Dell, for the Linux support.",0
"(Worst Operating System Software Ever!!!! Great hardware though...): The Hardware is great, but the chrome software is horrible. Thought this might be a good fit for any kind of work on the go, but if you learned on a mac or windows based software, then good luck learning how the new chrome software functions (it doesn't!). And they make it next to impossible to use any other program/app/service other than their own awful services, like the hoops you need to go through to add dropbox or any other cloud service that isn't googles service. Totally disregarding the users intentions and needs to promote their own service. No Thanks. This just became an expensive Video streamer!",0
(Do not purchase): Laptop stopped working two months after receiving it. It has power but will not boot up. I didn't buy an extended warranty so I'm out of pocket for the full price.Update 05/28/20. Now laptop will not power. Tested supplied power cable. It's good. Got another compatible power cable. Laptop will still not power on. I would give it no stars if possible.,0
(Fast and Capable!!): This purchase was to replace a 4 yr old HP laptop that is a main system for the home. This computer is fast and has fast capacity storage as files are transferred. I am impressed with this laptop. The RAM and Video is stacked! The fingerprint login saves time and energy with no password fail. There is a PIN but my print speaks volumes!! All I can say is sleek and futuristic this laptop is tops!,0
"(I’m sure it’s good for some): I’m sure it’s good for some, just not me. Pretty slow on a very fast connection. Can not use iTunes without first dropping into Google Play from a PC or Mac. MS Office Online version pretty much not useable for lite business even. It’s a nice looking package but lacks basic use ability. Charger fitting very tiny and was obvious it would not last. Returned for full refund. Seller was great!",0

"(I've been a Dell customer for years. This computer was a dud. I'm sorry I bought it.): I bought my XPS 13 in late 2018. This is my fifth Dell computer. I'm a full-time writer, so in the spirit of full disclosure, I should say that I'm on my computer at least five to six hours a day. The battery lasted a year and a half. I was going to replace it, but shortly thereafter one of the screws that held the monitor hinge together broke (a quick Google search told me this was a common issue), and the keyboard lifted off. I had a computer repair person glue the housing/hinge back together, and that fix lasted for about six months. Now the keyboard around the on/off switch is completely loose and raised up about a quarter inch. I once again took it to a computer repair place, and he suggested that I not spend money on fixing it as any repair wouldn't hold. I truly believe the problem with his computer is that it's just too small. It's a shame because the operating system and keyboard work just as well as all the other Dell computers I've purchased. I expect to get three years out of my computers. All my previous Dells have held their own for at least six years at a time. This one started to mess up after the warranty expired. Take away: No more 13"" laptops for this writer.",0
"(Recomendado): Cosmetically impecable, sin fallas, óptima funcionalidad hasta este momento de uso",0
(High resolution is very good.): This laptop is a great product. It replaced a 11 year old HP pavilion. The screen and the backlit keyboard are my favorite features.,0
(Does not Charge): I received this product and was very excited. It looked nice and seemed like it would do the job. But it just would not charge. I tried every outlet in my house. Kept unplugging and replugging. It would charge for 5 seconds and then stop or not even pick up the charge at all. This was so disappointing. I called amazon and they were great with sending me a replacement item two days later. This is the worst part. the replacement came. AND IT HAS THE SAME problem!!!!! It held the charge for 5 minutes max and then stopped working. I am retuning the replacement and just getting a refund. Maybe this is why the product was so cheap.,0
(Five Stars): Best laptop I’ve ever purchased!,0
"(The laptop is gorgeous. A bit smaller than expected ...): The laptop is gorgeous. A bit smaller than expected. This is a dim computer, so if you are looking for a bright display, this is not it. Also, the video pixelates and are blurry. I am returning it for these reasons.",0
"(So far, so good): This computer met all my expectations. Came well packaged and shrink-wrapped and is definitely new and in perfect condition. I love the color and the screen quality is wonderful.",0
"(A great laptop for a great price): I have been building my own PC's for gaming since the late 80's. Granted in the last 10-12 years my system builds have become a bit more budget minded due to having a family and other responsibilities. This laptop has everything I would want in a new desktop build and probably more than my normal budget would allow. The screen is amazing, the RGB keyboard is hypnotizing (according to my wife and kids) the power of the CPU&GPU is extremely good. Everything I have thrown at it has run great 100+ FPS. I also really like the MSI tool for adjusting gaming mode, I was able to run it on silent playing Assassins Creed Odyssey with barely a hitch in the graphics and not a peep from the fans so my family could watch TV and not hear fans all night. Even in normal mode with the fans allowed to adjust automatically my son's comment regarding the fans was ""This laptop sounds like it's talking where your old laptop was screaming"" lol My only critique is the screen has a bit of light bleed at the edges when it's at max brightness but this might just be mine. I haven't contacted MSI support yet to find out if this is normal. Overall I am very satisfied with my choice, I looked at several other gaming laptops in this price range and kept hearing how good the MSI was and knowing MSI has had a very good reputation for a very long time it was't hard to make the leap.",0
(Great budget laptop): The laptop is great for the price point. Just think of the laptops before touch screen and 2-in-1. Very pleased with this purchase.,0
"(Love this laptop): What a great value. This laptop performs exactly as you'd expect a gaming laptop to perform.Pros: Keyboard Feel. Performance overall Value for the money.Cons: Typical gaming performance battery wise. Gaming PC's and Batteries do not mix well. This is no exception. Runs slightly hotter than is ideal which in turn keeps those fans spinning, which of course isn't as quiet as you might prefer. 70C+ is typical even with a cooling pad. I should add it is summertime in FL so consider ambient temps in mid 70's F.Overall, I am very pleased. I may decide to add a higher quality Thermal paste and I would expect cooler temps. I would also like to add a SSD as 500GB is a little light for a gaming PC. For the $$$ you can't go wrong. It's a beast.",0
I bought this laptop because it looks professional,0
"(Good Value; Limited Battery Life): I got this computer during the big holiday sales season, and have used it quite a bit since then. Overall, I'd say it meets just about all my needs: fast, sufficient memory and storage, and being thin and light is very nice. It has two USB ports, which is adequate.The two quibbles are, first, that the screen resolution could be (a lot) better; not great for videos, but okay for office work. The second consideration is that, while the battery charges quickly, it only lasts about three hours on battery charge...so I carry around an extension cord for when I'm in meetings and such. Overall, I'd recommend it for people wanting a primarily business laptop, not one for gaming or movie watching.",0
"(Bad choice): we will so disappointed with this laptop, respond very slow, it is not like a i7 cpu. we had ask for a return, but 4 days passed, nobody contact me. So disappointed with Canada Computer and Amazon.",0
"(Apple MacBook Air 2020): Love the Apple MacBook Air affordable price than paying $1,000 for any computer",0

The screen is fabulous and the overspeed fan keeps it cool under pressure.,0
"(I really like it.): I needed a laptop to plug into my worksation (in which I also game at ultra wide 1440p) and after comparing laptops for weeks I found that this one has the best performace to price relation (I bought it for $2,049~).Cons:- It doesn't have an sd memory card reader.- It doesn't have an integrated webcam.- I kind of miss the numpad (but I suppose I'll get used to the support one)- That's it.Pros:- Has a support numpad- Cooling is awesome, no thermal throttling so far.- Even though it's made of plastic it feels high quality.- I'm impressed with the display, it doesn't feel like 1080p.- You can dominate starbucks with the RGB lights or you can turn them all off, no problem.- It's easily upgradeable (for a future 32gb and 2tb).- The MUX switch to plug your external monitors directly to the GPU.Finally, let me cite ultrabookreview:""Compared to the 2021 Scar 15, the 2022 model implements a higher-power GPU, a MUX, and an improved thermal compound on the CPU. All these lead to a 7-15% increase in framerates when comparing this 3070Ti 2022 model to the higher-tier 3080 variant of the 2021 Scar 15.This Scar 15 also ends up scoring slightly higher framerates than the Scar 17 previously tested, once again most likely because of the more mature software implemented on this unit.""I'll keep updating this review as time passes but I hope it helps for now.",0

"(Great for the price, design is elegant): This is an excellent budget lap top. The build quality is good for the price, the color options and design are really nice given the price. It is lighter than other laptops that have the same sized screen, which is important when your wife is small. The laptop is not the quickest on the market, but if you know how to set up your laptop correctly after getting it out of the box, the lag is not noticeable. I bought this as a basic laptop companion, so we basically use it for internet, email and streaming videos. Those functions run smoothly on the device. We do not do anything heavy on the laptop. The keys are responsive and the screen appears sharp.",0
(Laptop doesn't load up.): I just got this laptop on Saturday and it doesn't load up when I type my password in. This product isnt even worth $168.,0
"(Decent): Not the fastest, not the most perfect, screen quality seems to be on the lower end, some RGB is off, speaker also not the best, but happy with it so far for it's price. Totally ok for doing some light work on google drive. Battery life is good, best thing is I can use the quik app for gopro control.",0
"(Great performance for games and beautiful screen): I needed an upgrade from my dud HP Omen laptop, and the MSI quality shows. The keyboard, screen quality and refresh rate, and performance while gaming are all superb. The fans can get loud, but they get the job done and keep the computer from getting too hot. Things were great but my F12 key fell off soon after I got it - all the other keys are fine, so I'm not sure why this one was defective. Everything else has been better quality than other laptops I've had, but I have to take points off for that.",0
I think the interesting LCD hinge design of Zenbook 14 actually helps with cooling (more than ergonomics as advertised) by elevating the air intake grill at the bottom for better air flow.,0

"(avoid at all costs. ships w. defective bios!): i bought this laptop thinking it would be perfect. i looked at a lot of other models and this one seemed the best and it was cheap. i found out first hand why that is when it arrived. first of all please avoid this laptop at all costs. it looks like a great cheap laptop. its defective from the factory. please research this for yourself. it ships with a firmware that will prevent the battery from charging. that’s right. from the factory it will brick itself and not charge. if your install takes too long or if you buy it and you don’t have over 40% battery charge to install the newest bios from acer, which voids your windows home s right off the bat, you are stuck with a brick. there’s no way to charge the battery. i got to go through the forced microsoft startup experience which took about 30 minutes to complete due to the computer deciding to get online and completely update windows with no way to bypass it first thing and then i wondered why it wasn’t charging. i found out at 15% battery remaining that it was a critical bios issue but if it dropped below 40% i would no longer be able to charge it. and that’s what happened. as i frantically sat with my brand new computer i tried to force the bios update, the machine hit 10% battery life, auto power saving hibernation mode instantly, i tried to reboot into windows and it’s bricked with a red battery logo now.acer should be down right ashamed for selling these and putting them on the market. read the other reviews. it’s likely you will buy one of these machines direct from amazon like i did sept 10 2022. i used it for a grand total of 45 minutes between opening the box, updating windows and critically updating bios only for it to brick. buy a better machine or don’t get one at all. my other machine broke down and i needed something quick and now. this would’ve done the job. it ended up letting me down right off the bat and cost me the time and effort plus my business lost revenue. unacceptable.

"(Good gaming laptop): It is nice gaming laptop with nice configuration . Ryzen 7 5800H + 16GB RAM dual channel and NVIDIA 3050Ti is enough to play really good games . Value for this configuration I would say is exceptional.Unfortunately there is only 1 SSD slot, so in order to upgrade the memory need original SSD to be replaced with new memory . For gaming laptop SSD 512GB is not enough . Its not very noisy laptop, I would say it's very quiet and I love it because of that .Battery should last more . Lasted 6 hours without playing or doing anything on the laptop . From 100% battery to 0 it took 6 hours .Sound quality is amazing !It's lightweight and powerful !Will be recommended !",0
"(Wifi Drivers Barely Work): Barely two weeks after having received the laptop, the wifi drivers are barely working. The laptop consistently acts as though wifi does not exist and I am constantly forced to restart the laptop just to get it to recognize local wifi connections.Yesterday, no amount of restarts worked, and the wifi hub in the lower right completely vanished. I ended up having to completely factory reset the computer just to get the wifi drivers back working. Do NOT bother buying this piece of broken machinery. Sending mines back.",0
(works excellent): everything is fine,0
"(Powerful laptop): Wow! Great laptop. Amazing speed, lit keyboard and 10 hour battery. Slim and lightweight. Fingerprint access, which works MOST of the time. Rest of the time, use a PIN or your password. Very pleased with this laptop.",0
"(Fabulous !): It was like new, 100% satisfied and so is my daughter who uses it for school.",0
(My computer knows me): I love this Google Chrome book I always use Google Chrome so this is great the computer knows everything it’s all hooked up in one I love it,0
"(The best non-Mac laptop!): As much as I would have loved an Apple laptop .. so not in my budget! This Asus laptop is awesome - lightweight, huge 15.6 screen, nice long-lasting battery, and fast! Now I have my office computer and my personal laptop -- I'm really happy. You will be too!",0
(Four Stars): Great Chromebook for high school and college student.,0
"(Muy buena laptop, rápida y se actualiza a Windows 11.): Una Laptop económica que cumple muy bien las expectativas, tiene las características de computadoras más costosas a menor precio. Se pueden andar juegos muy bien. No tiene ? pero ese no es problema al configurar el teclado en Espa?ol.",0
"(PRETTY MUCH THE BEST ONE): I hope this is the last laptop I'll ever own honestly. Even if my current one breaks I'll buy it again. I have it hooked up to a 29"" ultra wide curved monitor and it runs that fine even while streaming. You may need to dumb some in game settings down just a tad. But if you're coming from a toaster like me, it's a HUGE upgrade and I'm totally ok with it.",0
(Great product and Great Company!!): Overall I love the computer. I purchased it for work and personal use and it works great. The only issue I have experienced is a hardware issue that affected one of my speakers. When I contacted customer service they set up an in home technician appointment and the issue was resolved within 2 business days at no cost to myself. The only thing it doesn't have that I wish it did is a touch screen; not a deal breaker but a learning curve as my last one had one.,0
"(A great laptop for daily use): I don't use laptops very frequently; for some reason, I just can't seem to put my phone or iPad down to grab my laptop. It's not necessarily because laptops aren't great, I'm just lazy. I recently gave my wife my MacBook Air because I just didn't use it much, but seeing this Acer with the EVO i7 badge and 8 GB of ram was too hard to pass up, as it was what I was looking for when I ultimately decided on the unneeded 16GB ram MacBook Air: the 8GB of ram is MORE than enough for my daily tasks, and is typically good for random gaming (take the horror game Visage: it requires 6, prefers 8, so this is right in the wheelhouse).The laptop feels efficient, programs open really quick, the keyboard is highly responsive and, though there's a bit of a click, it's the perfect amount for someone that doesn't like those loud programming keyboards but also doesn't like those whisper quiet ones that some tablets come with.The appearance is basic on the outside but sharp on the inside; the white/silver keyboard is just plain nice to look at, and having white as the backlight color is especially nice at night.As for the battery, that's an easy 5* for me. I constantly put my computer in sleep and come back like 24-48 hours later. Doing that repeatedly for a week, I still opened this thing up to have over 2.5 hours of battery life left. I had this computer for at least 2 weeks and have plugged it in literally ONE time, at the very beginning. Wow. I'm still at 2hr and 3min battery left, and that's 22%.Overall, I don't know if someone that uses and abuses their laptops, like I used to in College, will gravitate towards this Acer, because I'm not terribly familiar with what they're looking for. If you're a developer, you probably need double the ram. If you're a hardcore gamer, you'll probably need double the ram AND a better graphics card.BUT:If you're a fairly regular laptop user who likes lightweight units, doesn't need a touch screen, still likes multiple USB ports, and likes a hefty battery life, along with half a TB of space, sure, you might find something cheaper if you research, but from my recent experience with no research into comparable units, and just the testing I've had with this, I would recommend the Acer for sure. As someone who bought a MacBook Air with the M1 Chip and 16GB of ram, but just didn't use it that frequently, this Acer has more than taken it's place. I didn't need that much ram. This one does everything I need.",0
(Great product): I am satisfied with this product was for my daughter but I would certainly get one for myself,0
"(Highly recommend.): Great value for $250 (after tax and delivery). Very smooth transitions, loads apps within 1 second. Even runs CS:GO at 60 frames per second (which is smooth performance. I have had this laptop for 2 weeks and I have used 300 gigabytes of the hard drive already, and this slows the performance of the computer. I went ahead and replaced the hard drive with a solid state drive, which made this computer load everything INSTANTLY. Runs faster and smoother than my brothers $900 desktop that he built. This is not a gaming rig, but it runs very fast for CS:GO which is the other reason I bought this PC besides for schoolwork. I highly recommend this PC, have not had any problems with it besides that I have to purchase a windows 10 product key, but this is optional.",0
(Terrible!): A little over a month having this and it’s not working right! Would not recommend.,0
"(Not worth the money I spent): Can't see video on my directv app, can't use my cbs all access or netlix. Games are ok. I should have just bought a tablet. Would have been happier",0
s pen is awesome compared with my surface pen pro 6,0
(Must buy!): I've had this laptop for over 2 1/2 years now and it is still going strong ! It is an awesome / affordable laptop!,0
(The Processor): The processor (Intel Core i3-1005G1) on the website says that it get up to 3.4GHz but the CPU only actually runs at 1.20 to 1.19 GHz. that's a pretty big deal considering that the main reason I bought this laptop was because of the CPU power and the amount of RAM. Everything else about this machine is good.,0
"(The worst computer I have ever owned!): I have the 2019 version and it is the worst (no hyperbole actually the worst) computer I have ever owned! Bad customer service experiences, poor reliability, never lived up to its specs. A fantastic disappointment in nearly every regard. The screen is nice though. I mean it hasn't run correctly for more than a month. I am on my second one after they had to replace the first one, and the second one is with HP as it is also failing.It won't run Adobe software, even the wimpy stuff. It overheats and freezes constantly. In the end, both computers could barely handle simple tasks without slowing significantly. If it was one lemon fine. But two terrible computers tell me something is wrong with QC or design.If you want a really expensive computer for checking email get this. If you want a computer for anything else, buy something else.I should add I bought this directly from HP not through Amazon.This is the last HP I will ever purchase.",0
(Good laptop): It functions just fine as a computer. But as soon as I got it and updated the drivers the touchpad stopped working. I've tried all sorts of solutions I've found on the internet to fix the situation. I've been given a couple different links to drivers directly on the Lenovo website but they don't fix the issue. Had to buy a usb wireless mouse.,0
"(It’s what you get for the price, it very good.): It’s the best budget gaming computer",0
(Buy with confidence.): Prompt shipping. Well packaged. Works as expected. No issues from seller.,0
(Hp 14 inches): It just suitable for my kind of work. Easy carriage due to it size,0
(Amazing): Got this for my granddaughter for Christmas had to try it out to make sure it worked. Enjoying it so much might have to keep it for myself lol Very glad I purchased !!!,0
(Lap top was easy to set up): Granddaughter was please with easy set up,0
"(Great for the kids!): We got 2 of these for the kids schooling. They work great, great battery life. We only use them for their school work, google classroom and etc. Kids use them for Roadblocks and Minecraft also.",0
"(Time wasted it took getting to destination.): Product got to Fairfield, Ohio 3:31 AM on 5/13. Only left facility 4:07 5/14. That's a day and a half just sitting there. One would think a box arrived at 3:31 AM would leave some time that day. It had to go several miles down the road to Hamilton, Ohio.Haven't opened box yet; if it works the way it should , will increase the stars.",0
(Amazing Speed!): Excellent machine!,0
"(Great laptop but needs to be upgraded to run smoothly): If you don’t upgrade the ram from 32 to 64 your fans will be running nonstop and the laptop will get hot and run slow. But once updated all that won’t happen anymore. Also it only comes with a 512 gig hard drive that you will need to upgrade to at least a terabyte hardrive, which takes a lot of time and money. Otherwise I am happy with the laptop.",0
motherboard it isn't an easy task for new or inexperienced owners,0
"(Great little chromebook): We bought 18 of those. Easy to use, easy to connect to g suite, great picture quality and fast delivery",0
(Great): I gave this to my husband since his old laptop died. He really loves it!,0
(Trouble with sounds.): After 2 months. The sounds on my Acer laptop does not work anymore.,0
"(Good fetures): computer was delivered on time and was in good condition but after signing in first time uploaded my info. and after signing off when I signed on again the screen went blank, tried several attempts but no luck. Same day we returned the laptop.",0
The machine will get hot and loud,0
(Small size computer that is a great for college use.): This was a gift for my daughter. She raves about computer. It fits her needs for college. She takes it with her to school and is very thankful for this gift.,0
(Excellent product!): The only thing that I dislike could be the cpu temperature because sometimes reach 90 celcius without warning and I must turn on the fans manually to control it (Windows 11) I've been reaching out for solutions and seems to be an optmization issue with W11,0
"(Respectable processing, but for this amt of $, buy something else): First the good...Great keyboard, thin, respectable graphics, love that it's a high res touchscreen.Then the shortcomings...- Yes, I know it's flagship, and thin, but still would like to have had at least one USB-A connector.- Doesn't take smaller chargers. I have a super small 30W charger I like to travel with. My MBP will not complain and during use, will not drain as fast if connected and take its time charging when not being used. The Dell XPS will just say ""no"".- gets hotter than I would like and fans not as quiet as what I would expect from a flagship laptop (expert opinion).- I'm trying to think of a product I have in my house with a camera that is worse than this one... and for the life of me, I can't come up with one. This includes an old Samsung phone, a generic Chinese tablet, and a 6 year old, base model, sub $400 Lenovo Flex 3 I bought on sale. I just can't believe it's this bad. I just assumed that a flagship laptop purchase would have an impressive camera and had I known it was this bad, I would definitely have bought something else. Unfortunately in today's world and because of the apps we use, camera quality is now a top priority on laptops and pushes this laptop to the bottom of any consideration list. The Dell XPS15 9500 (2020) camera plain sucks. Light, bright light, low-light: the only safe-for-work adjective I have for it is: sucks. The camera ruins it for the whole laptop. Assume you don't have one. I have yet to try the reinstall driver recommendation I read on Dell's website post, but I'll try that... I regret not doing my usual research and due diligence in comparing products and reading reviews before making this (very expensive) purchase. :(",0
"Powerful- game performance exceeded my expectations, even with just 8 gig of RAM",0
"(Terrible screen quality. Don’t waste your money.): I own a MacBook Pro and wanted a cheaper option for a smaller laptop. After seeing the screen quality and lack of functionality since you’re basically locked inside Chrome, I sent it back immediately.I’ll just drop the extra money on a small MacBook.Terrible screen quality. Save yourself the trouble.",0
(Above and beyond!): All and all a great computer. Very pleased with everything. Ram is upgradeable if wanted.,0

"(Como hago valida la garantía de este articulo): Recientemente compre esta laptop, solo parpadea un led azul, y ya no enciende. ?Cómo puedo hacer valida la garantía?",0
(Best 579$ laptop): This Laptop is perfect. I suggest putting a price alert on it because Amazon has flash sales. I bought mine for $579 and couldn't be happier. Does everything I need it to. I must have gotten a good one off the line cuz there is almost 0 backlight bleed. Runs fast. Starts in seconds. You can undervolt to improve thermals but it does a great job with that anyway. No complaints! Just wait till the price drops before you buy it. The sales only last about 20 minutes here and there.Will update in a month with a follow up review.,0
"(Bought 2, both died within 5 weeks.): Bought two, one for each of my little girls for Christmas. The first one went into a black out in 10 days, while the other lasted almost 5 weeks before it did the same. Very disappointed in Asus. We have always considered them to be one of the better laptop brands and have loved the one laptop that I bought my wife. However, these are defective.",0
"(Great laptop for the price!): I bought this laptop for my wife for basic needs. She loves the size and weight of the laptop. It performs well so far, no issues.",0
(Great value): Love this machine. For the money can’t be beat. Not great hi def. but really clear and a great product.,0

"(Warning False Advertising!): Watch out guys this product is not labeled correctly. It's an i5, not an i7. They basically send you the older model because the different acer aspires share the same frame. share the same frame. I attached pictures of the actual specs. I loved my old acer and had it for four years, but this thing is even slower than the 2014. Hope this helps.",0
(it was what i was looking for is is great for what i want): i like the chromebook very much it does everthing i want,0
"(Nice MacBook): It’s not my first MacBook, and the quality of it is up to standards. My issue is that I bought it in June of 2022, and it says it was produced in 2020. The title is misleading, it makes you think that it’s 2020 model. I hoped it wasn’t sitting on the shelf for two years, but looks like it was.",0
(Dead): Hard drive crashed month two. Worthless.,0
(Really great for gaming): It’s been a pretty good laptop for gaming. So if you want a gaming laptop instead of a whole pc this is a good choice.,0
"(Great Laptop BUT the SPEAKERS are horrible!): Before purchasing, I read the reviews and thought how bad can the speakers be?The SPEAKERS are horrible! Constantly trying to adjust to every video. Volume turned up to 100% and still sounds like 40%. I really have no other complaints. If they fixed this issue, I would buy a second one.",0
(The best for the money): This is probably one of the best laptops in the market for the money.,0
(Beware): NOT A HAPPY CAMPER! We purchased this for our college bound daughter. It was supposed to be a touch screen. It wasn't. Returned and for my $$'s back,0
(Great Product): Best AAA+++,0

(Good but oddly loud): Loud coil whine and Hugh fan speed seemingly at random but otherwise great laptop,0

(GreT computer): Top quality computer,0
(Buena opción de buen material): Me parece que en desempe?o esta muy cerca de la Acer Nitro 5 del mismo a?o.. pero en acabado de material es claramente mejor. Se calienta un poco pero nada que no se pueda solucionar aumentando la velocidad del enfriamiento o sumandole una base enfriadora.,0

(Doesn’t work): Quit working,0
(2017 Samsung): I just purchased this lap top for basic uses. I own a Samsung phone and tablet and I'm very happy with them. I will update my review on Wednesday when my laptop arrives.

(---): ---,0
(Five Stars): Great arrival time. Great product. Zero issues.,0
"(I would not buy this laptop or recommend it to anyone.): This laptop costs 2,000 dollars. For that type of money I expected the best laptop with the best components. How is a laptop that costs 2,000 dollars come with such a terrible camera ? It makes no logical sense. The touch screen is a gimmick. Honestly, just buy the M1 Mac. It works right out of the box. Im going back to Apple. Ordering a MacBook Air right now. Can't wait to get it.",0
(It is brand new! It looks like and labeled like aircraft avionics gear.): I have not turned it on yet. I will be crushed if it turns into a dot net POS. But the hardware is beautiful. It appears to be New. Like special. Care went into the build of this machine. It has a new Microsoft Windows Pro sticker where the key code is still covered with scratch off. Call me impressed,0
"(I want my defective computer replaced): This machine NEVER worked. After the first month or so. It started to overheat and froze. This became the norm, after working for just a few minutes, each time I had to switch off and restart after 15-30 minutes. When this was reported I was told that the period for returns had expired!!! I then checked with Dell to see if the warranty would allow repairs or return and was told that they did not have a machine registered in my name or that number. The order at amazon seemed to be placed through a second party. So today I have a seemingly ""new"" machine that is not working and no recourse thanks to Amazon!! I am quite willing to send this machine back and have it replaced. I await your feedback",0
I also have had numerous issues with one of the left side USBs dropping connection,0
"(Worthless): I've had the computer for almost a year without too many issues. I just can't ""connect to the internet."" HP is uesless. I tried to contact them, but never had any luck.

(Bad screen): Can not be ignored very annoying,0
"The power cord has the stupid knuckle an inch from the end, positioned to catch the edge of the table when you set the laptop down.",0
"(Do not buy if looking for real AX/wifi 6): Do not believe the listing. It states clearly in several places, wifi 6 certified and 802.11ax. It's false advertising. I bought this in order to be future proofed. I didn't realize it's not wifi 6 until I started having problems months later with the cheap Realtek 8822CE wireless card in the laptop. Look that chip up, it's an AC card, not AX and it can't even do AC wireless properly. It's a cheap wireless chip that drops packets and firmware updates just made it worse. Plenty of people complaining about issues with it and ultimately having to replace it. I'm currently using a cheap USB wifi dongle so I can have a decent connection to work from home. Seller hasn't even responded. Amazon should be going after them for false advertising.",0
(This laptop has exceeded my expectations.): This laptop has exceeded my expectation and has taken my video editing Capabilities to another level.,0
"(Muy bien): Recién ayer me llego y estuve probandolo en un uso cotidiano, la uso para la universidad.El envío duro un poco mas de lo que pensé, pero no supero la semana. Algo que no me gusto fue que la caja venia con un agujero. Quiero creer que por la aduana.En cuestión de la apto es muy rápida, nunca había tenido un equipo con características similares y se siente el cambio.La pantalla es buena (al no haber probado una full hd antes)El teclado se siente algo raro, pero es por costumbre, tiene tres niveles de luz pero en algunas teclas tiene unas ""manchas"". Lo agrego en la tercera foto, no se si sea normal. El único detalle es la falta de ñ. Se puede configurar el teclado pero no es lo mismo.La batería es decente. Al instalar todos mis programas duro muy bien.Lo que me gusto es el peso y tamaño. Es ligera y relativamente mas pequeña a laptops del mismo tamaño de pantalla.Obviamente voy a continuar probandola y actualizar la reseña.",0

"The hardware is sleek, and I was unexpectedly happy with the RGB backlit keyboard\lid.",0
"(Working great): Laptop works great. I was disappointed that the keyboard was not back lit, but I saw a review on Amazon about a function key (F5) that turns it in or off. That detail was not in any of the materials sent with the laptop.",0
(Awesome lightweight notebook.): It may replace my iPad Pro 11” based on my use so far.,0
(Excelente producto): Excelente producto,0
(Better than expected): Was looking for a budget laptop for one of my kids. Is a lightweight device. Run all office and school applications without problem. Fast response when open applications.I just take one star. Battery not so good. Only provide 2 hrs operation unplugged in economy mode.,0
(Easy to use): Great choice,0
The worst parts about this laptop is how fragile this is,0
"(Great laptop for the price): Bought this laptop and a 32gb ( 16 x 2 ) memory kit. Installed Solus Linux and I could not be happier.Love the keyboard and the overall profile of this laptop. It's not heavy and is very thin for a 15.6"" laptop. It does have a budget NMVe m.2 drive, so I will upgrade that at some point for some additional, faster storage.Linux runs great on this laptop. All of the function keys work ( screen brightness, volume, etc ). An AMD Ryzen 7 quad-core with 8-threads and 32gb is quite a bit of resources for Linux. Time to install Docker and get to work !!!",0
"(The only downside is that it can overload on video easily. I learned not to open a lot of ...): I bought this after breaking my last Chromebook (totally my fault/the cat's fault). They are super-efficient and simple computers. I mostly use my computers for streaming, surfing and writing Word documents so I can't imagine spending more than this.The only downside is that it can overload on video easily. I learned not to open a lot of Youtube tabs or run 2 videos at the same time, which can lead to freezing.",0
(No charger? Seriously?): Where's thr charger? How do I use a product that doesn't even come with everything it's supposed to. I read some other reviews and other customers get a charger. This is unacceptable,0
(Great laptop for the money.): I just use it to check my mail and to shop on line.,0
(Ok): Ok,0
it is fast,0
"(Buena pero…): En general es buena y eficiente, y si les sirve de algo: Si corre GTA V sin ningún problema, a buenos gráficos y sin lag.Pero a tan solo 2 días de tenerla, ya no me dejó arrancar windows ;-;Intenté solucionarlo con las opciones que da pero nada, tuve que restaurarla de fábrica, algo absurdo para solo haberla tenido conmigo 2 días. Si vuelve a ocurrir lamentablemente tendré que devolverla.",0
(Great value): Price is affordable.,0
(Great performance): At first I had problem with de audio driver.,0
"(Fast, but no iTunes and no streaming apps?!?!?!): I have buyers regret now. I bought this to update from my old Mac Pro and was hoping I could get some streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc and none of that is available. I use my laptop for movies and TV while traveling. No CD drive and none of the aforementioned items make this laptop basically useless to me",0
"(External dual monitors are a nightmare): Do not get this laptop if you wish to replace a typical desktop computer and use it with dual external monitors. Especially via the USB C port. I am constantly dealing with the computer entirely freezing up and losing HDMI signal. This occurs when doing absolutely nothing CPU/GPU intensive. Simply opening a Netflix tab will kill the monitor signal and the entire computer will become unresponsive for many minutes at a time, often requiring a hard restart.Laptop is nice and portable and works (seemingly) fine with one monitor directly via its HDMI port. But as soon as there is an attempt to extend the display and use both the HDMI and USB C for dual monitor setup (regardless of resolution), it becomes an absolute nightmare.",0
(Didn’t work. Had to return): Thumbs down 👎🏾,0
"(Great Gift): I bought this as a Christmas gift. The memory can be increased with an SD card as 16GB can be eaten up rather quickly. The battery lasts over five hours which is perfect for browsing. It tends to load a little slow sometimes, but that's to be expected.",0
"(Me fascina esta laptop): Voy a ser lo más preciso y honesto posible. Compre esta laptop el 24 de enero de 2018 y aun posee un excelente rendimiento, obiamente la duración de la bateria ya no es de casi 5 horas como al principio pero aun asi se mantiene en casi 4 horas dependiendo el ipo de tareas que este realizando.Si estas buscando una laptop para tareas y jugar esta es la tuya.",0
(Awesome Computer!): This thing weighs almost nothing. Easy to use. Does everything my full sized laptop does. Very portable.Some techy folks will find something wrong with it--as they usually do.If you want something to write Word Documents and Excel spreadsheets--this is the one.I got it for the sole purpose of learning Python.I downloaded Python and PyCharm and I'm good.If you want it as a backup to do something in the go--get this one.,0
"(Something Fishy): Wanted to upgrade from previous version after donating the old one to my younger brother. Went with the 4gb version with dual cores. DOA in an very odd way. Whoever logs into a Chromebook first it recognizes as its owner. Well the first account to log in works for about 120 seconds then starts flashing screen off and on before rebooting and bringing you to log in screen. Add new user, works perfectly fine. Quite snappy and brilliant display. Try to go back to owner log in and you get instant screen blink in and out, 4 - 6 cycles and then reboot and log in screen.I thought it was a glitch in the Google settings so we tried multiple accounts logging in first and same thing everytime. Powerwashing unit by secondary user and trying again. I have a family of 5 and I know everyones log in information so i tried them all. Every user after the first would wotk fine, first on the machine and it is utteraly un-usable.I gave it 2 stars because a D.O.A. computer is not unheard of but this is clearly not shipping damage. Something in the build is wrong.Went to the ACER for a little more but I am not happy to have to give up the Micro SD Slot this one has. That is the reason it did not get 1 star.",0
"(Amazing!): I was looking at a different laptop and this happened to come up. I debated it for days before pulling the trigger. I couldn’t be happier. This is an amazing laptop. Games look and play so great! My best friend is also jealous that it out performs her gaming rig, so that’s a plus for me lol. Pull the trigger and get it. It does get a bit hot, but with that performance I expect it. Just get a stand with a fan in it. Amazing!!",0
"(Mainly for school): Bought for school, my 15 yr old plays some games on it as well. No complaints, good screen and battery life.",0
"(Good quality): Can't really use the HDMI for second screen feature. Pretty reliable computer. Battery life is pretty decent. Screen is small so it is idea for portable situations. Not a big fan of the Lenovo pen (purchased separately). Overall it is a pretty nice device. I would recommend this to college students or home business folks that need easy, get up and go kind of handling.",0
"(Decent performance, flimsy construction): The performance was pretty respectable for the price, although one reason for the low price is the meager 4GB of RAM. I upgraded mine as soon as I bought it. I also had a 1TB HD laying around, so I added that at the same time. (I love the performance of the NVMe drive, but 128GB is pretty small.) Most other laptops I've worked on had a small panel that could be removed to access the RAM and HD, but this one required removing the entire back panel. This was pretty tedious, and it would be disturbingly easy to damage the cover. Replacing it was also a little tricky. I realize that laptops don't have much in the way of user-serviceable parts, but that's no reason to make it harder to access those they do have.Despite the i3 CPU, this machine runs very hot, and vents the exhaust straight downward. Don't even think about using it on you actual lap, at least not without some kind of lap desk.Within a month or two of purchase, I noticed the hinges starting to show signs of serious wear. Then, the frame for the display started to crack. This got steadily worse. Then, one day the display itself was clearly damaged. The next day, it stopped working altogether. The machine still works otherwise, but it can only be used with an external display, which kind of defeats the purpose of a laptop.I used this laptop exclusively at home, and I don't think my handling was unusually rough, so this rapid failure is hugely disappointing. Unfortunately, this seems to be something of a trend. As manufacturers have shifted toward ""thin and light"" designs, laptops have grown increasingly flimsy. This machine failed after less than six months, and the one it replaced only lasted about a year. By contrast, I'm typing this review on a five year old Toshiba that I kept around as a backup. Laptops are just a little too expensive to be considered disposable.",0
"(Potencia de sobra): Corre lejos cualquier juego a este a?o, todo realmente me gusto de esta computadora",0
"(Unable to download updated chrome OS, unable to use): Received new and gmail wouldn't load properly because the old browser wasn't supported. Attempted to download new chrome OS and it took about 4 hours to download and wouldn't ever complete the process. Called acer and they said there was nothing they could do, they suggested I tried chromebook support which told me to powerwash the device and reboot. Which I did and nothing happened. Spent hours researching the problem, seems another user that ordered around black friday also had the same bug. Very frustrating experience. Will buy better chromebook x 360 (14 inch version) from Best Buy instead for $500 and peace of mind.",0
(Good for what I need it for): I really like this laptop. I was able to upgrade from Microsoft 10 S to regular so I’m able to download apps outside of the Microsoft store. I bought this mainly to use with my silhouette machine and I think this will do the trick without taking up too much room. I bought a chromebook awhile back without realizing that you can’t download other software to it.,0
require just a little more resistance to depress,0
The big surprise when I received it was the larger than typical touch pad.,0
(Easy to Use): Nice screen quality and easy to use!,0
"(Its easy to use): I use it for online schooling andit's perfect. I dont usually care for laptops, but this one is easy to use and on the smaller side so easier to use.",0
the display is crisp and the colors are vibrant.,0
"(This is not my first Samsung Chromebook. My other ...): This is not my first Samsung Chromebook. My other one is much older, and the charger broke. Couldn't find one that fit, so purchased this new one. The only problem is the sound. It is so quiet. So now, I use the charger and plug in my old Chromebook. Watched a movie with my granddaughter, and as we watched, the volume went down until we could barely hear it. Found the movie on Hulu, and finished watching it on the TV",0
I found myself often pressing it by accident when I meant to press the delete key which is right next to it and of a similar size.,0
(awesome laptop - very happy): This Dell laptop has all the latest stuff including touch screen. The small form factor is incredible.Excellent fast delivery!,0
(It's what she requested!): My granddaughter loved this gift for graduation.,0
(Grand Daughter Loves It): Got this for my grand daughter for Christmas. Helped her in school.,0
(great laptop for the price): got this for my 9 year old to do homework and look up stuff for school on. it's pretty fast and the battery life is great for what she is using it for.,0
"(Great so far. Battery life two hours): Only had it for a day. Haven't done much but set up and install some apps. I will be using this to make videos. And the program seems to run great. I have been using this for about 2 weeks. I have a driver issue and I tried everything to fix but it still isn't fixed. It doesn't seem to be a hinder. After having it for a few weeks, I noticed I have a low battery life. Not a bid deal since I only use it at home, but could be if used somewhere with no plug in available.",0
"(Battery problems....): I bought 2. One, stopped working after about a year. When it comes on it keeps blinking. We dont know how to fix it. The other one, the battery wouldnt stay charged so I contacted the seller for another one. They sent it and it worked for about 8 months and then wouldnt keep a charge. So I started using it plugged in all the time. Then when my husband's started doing the blinking thing, I took his battery and mine works fine again.",0
(One of the best Chrome OS convertible in the market): This is the best convertible running Chrome OS right now. Good thing there's Samsung showing support for Chrome OS.,0
(Excelente. Gran calidad.): Excelente. Gran calidad.,0
(once configured (thanks youtube) works great now.): It was a pain to get up and running especially with all the auto updates. It also downloaded everything onto the SSD which caused problems and then I had to wipe the drives and start again...not plug and play...once configured (thanks youtube) works great now.,0
"(Small portable good battery): The missus loves this thing, small, powerful battery takes a beating so far",0
(S MODE dont buy): received 4 - IN S MODE - we buy a lot of pc's - s mode is horrible and it clearly said w10 when ordered - hate microsoft!,0
(A lot of things): The amount of updates you have to perform is ridiculous it took literally half a day to get everything up and running on the computer. After all was said and done I got the blue screen 3 times...Under load it gets pretty loud you will be able to hear it across the living room. When you plug in the charger there is a static sound coming from the laptop. The startup sound is really unnecessary and annoying. I have contacted Asus but if I have to ship it out to them I’m not shipping it for repairs I’m shipping it for a refund. For a $2k laptop it was a really disappointing buy.,0
Charging is amazingly fast. It took less than an hour to get to 100% from when it arrived.,0
"(Reliability): Slow, unreliable, not good for video conferences.",0
(Everything is ok): I am satisfied,0
(Upset but keep it because don’t want waist time but money): I thought this chrome book use for touch.But it not.It’s very disappointing,0
"(Five Stars): Great computer, but had to return it for a reason that has nothing to do with the computer.",0
"(Super rapido a la Argentina): Exelente Pc, los juegos los corre todo sin problemas, la uso para edicion de video tambien y sin problemas. llego a la argentina via UPS directo a mi casa en 48 hs!!!!",0
"(Great Chromebook): This does exactly what I need, writing on google docs. Fast enough for that and some light browsing. Lightweight but doesn't feel cheap. Only thing is I am not sure if there is a delete key, something I use a lot",0
"(Great for what I need): Light, fast, and intuitive...happy with the product (disclosure: I'm an Apple fan)",0
(Excelente): Muy buena,0
"(Durability and speed): Nice laptop,met all expectations",0
the sound is great and it has some audio stabilization ability so when you blast a song it lowers the levels so it doesn't pop your speakers,0
(Thank): Great,0
"(Too slow for even basic web surfing): It's cheap so you wouldn't expect to play games on it, but it's too slow even for watching youtube.",0
"(Una monada): Facil de usar y la batería dura bastante, es como una tableta con teclado....me gusta, además tiene un excelente precio",0
"(Amazing laptop): Amazing laptop, runs programs and games very fast. A little big to transport. Charger is big and heavy.",0
"(Very nice...): My experience with the Lenovo Flex 5 started about a month ago. At a glance the laptop itself looks beautiful. It has a sleek design and a crisp screen that makes videos look as if you are actually there in person.The graphics of the computer, however, leave some room to be desired. This is not a laptop you will be playing games on as it barely scrapes by to make the requirements for Civilization 5, never-mind any newer games.There are a few features that I have enjoyed in the last few weeks. First, the fingerprint sensor makes logging in fast and easy. It is very reliable and almost always recognizes my fingerprint on the first try. Second, the keyboard has a comfortable feel to it. The keys are crisp enough to have satisfaction when you type while not so loud that the whole neighborhood can hear you crunch the keys (as with some mechanical keyboards.)The battery life is satisfactory, but not the best I have seen in a laptop. Keep in mind that the screen in this computer is huge, and that alone can create a strain on the battery. Those people who like to go long periods of time without charging may find themselves out of luck and stuck in the abysmal battery saver mode.Focusing now on the flex part of the product, I don’t see myself using the tablet version too much. One way that feature is extremely useful, though, is for reading or watching a movie. Instead of having a heavy laptop sprawled across you (and the laptop is decently heavy), one can easily hold it in a more natural position to help facilitate hours of Netflix binge watching.Overall, my experience with this laptop has been a positive one. This laptop deserves a hearty 4 out of 5 stars, and to those inquiring into its purchase I do recommend it for students, businesses, and non-gamers.",0
"(I love this laptop!): I've had at least half a dozen mac laptops and as a non-pro the air is just what I needed. I replaced a Macbook Pro with the touch bar, the only Mac I've had which failed on me, and when I saw the price of new Macbook Pros I about fainted. I don't do graphics or video, I don't play games, I figured I'd just try the basic Macbook Air and see if it was fast enough. Bingo, it's great. New M1 processor is plenty for web surfing, daily use of the full MS Office suite with multiple windows open at the same time, video streaming etc. Battery life is terrific, I can work all day on a single charge! Sure there are people who need a ""Pro"" device but for the vast majority of us, even heavy daily usage, this is a spectacular computer.",0
The right shift key is smaller than a normal keyboard,0
"(Exactly what I needed. 256gb SSD): I bought this laptop with the intention of using it for my hospital training modules and casual use at home. Although, I haven’t bought a laptop since 2009, I’ve used a variety of laptops through friends and family members. The look, the feel and the quickness when switching through applications is really is so so smooth. I’m not a techy guy, but if you want a laptop for school, work or travel, I think this is the best bet.",0
"(This is great!!): I love this computer! It is so light weight and has such a long battery life. The screen is plenty big enough, and I love that it has the numbers on the side too. All around nice lap top.",0
(Good laptop for gaming): Great product for the price and good battery life. Graphics are nice.,0
"(It's very compatible with my needs): I just recently got this laptop, and it was really easy to set up! I got this laptop for school and to watch Netflix,hulu,etc. It works really well with Google classroom and all of the other Google things, but with Netflix the screen quality wasnt the best, but that doesn't really matter to me. Overall the laptop is really easy to use and I think that for how much it costed it was worth it😁",0
(No hardrive): I kept on getting hard disk 3F0 error. Pressed F2 and ran a hard disk check and it said Hard Drive not found. So I opened the laptop to find out that there isn't a hard drive.,0
(Five Stars): I love my Samsung Chrome Book. Its stylish and easy to use.,0
"(Does not come with fingerprint as description): It's very light and fast, operate smoothly till now but I expect the fingerprint reader as in the description, this version does not come with that",0
"(battery is not great): after about two months, the battery is not holding a charge for very long.",0
(Its nice): Good little laptop not bad at all,0
(Good product for the price): Laptop came in pretty good condition. Had some issues with starting the computer but was able to troubleshoot. Product well worth the price.,0
"(ASUS rules!!): Excelente equipo, y muy ligero, buena duracion de bateria y unas bocinas super potentes para un portatil. Lo probe para animacion. Edicion y no tuve mucha bronca. El unico detalle es la visibilidad no es 180 como dice.",0
(Chromebook): Love this took place of my laptop. But this much more compact.,0
"(Broken within months): Don't bother with this laptop- can't hold up after only 3 months it's got a broken fan, don't bother.",0
(It’s working fine for my cricket): Used with cricket,0
"(Not using for gaming): Using this PC for church. We needed an upgrade from our previous computer, because the software we use is supposed to run better with the video card this one has. Still checking it out, but so far it's nice overall.",0
"(looking good and going fast): everything came as advertised, and i couldn't be happier. wasn't filled with a ton of ad ware and useless crap, light RTS gaming is great and daily work and reports are a breeze. can't say enough how much i have enjoyed this laptop over the last few months since I got it and I get compliments on it everywhere i go. great machine for the price.",0
(Love this MacBook!): Love this Mac. Arrived fast and packaged well. Works great and as a first time Mac user it was very easy to learn. Great price at Amazon and very happy with the purchase. The computer is very fast.,0
The main problem I found with the laptop is that it heats up very quickly,0
(Facial Recognition to unlock screen is broke.): Facial Recognition to unlock screen is broke.,0
It has beautiful color and contrast and really impressed me as soon as I turned the computer on.,0
"(Very fast and amazon quality): This laptop is really fast and the battery lasts really long.The battery lasts me about a week with just one charge and I find that crazy.There is not fan noise and this doesn't get hot.The quality is really good.. I mean the way the laptop opens with one hand and the smooth closing of the lid is really smooth.The screen isn't the best but its still really good.This laptop has the M1 chip, fastest chip on the market.This laptop's bench marks are off the roof.It's great for casual use like, watching movies, using word docs and excel sheet, coding and video editing.I wouldn't recommend gaming even though basic games will do just fine.",0
"(I wish I had bought something something a little better.): I use this Chromebook for basic internet surfing. Sadly it is the slowest new computer I've ever bought, which is super frustrating because I bought it to replace a slow Windows PC. I wish I had returned it within the window to do so. On the positive side, it looks good, has a nice big screen, and starts up quickly.",0
(Thumbs up): This is a great deal & fantastic quality!,0
"(Excelente producto): Es brutal, excelente. Mi hija la recibió y lleva con ella encima desde que la recibió. Excelente producto. Acabados buenísimos, muy fiable para escribir. Genial",0
"(Four Stars): My kid seems to like it, and all homework is Google based, so this syncs up well.",0
(confianza en el vededor): Me agrado mucho la Rapides de envio y la Calida del equipo.,0
"(It's fun!): so far so good! I'm writing this on it now. It's challenging to learn a new OS, but I'm not lacking from anything. Don't even miss the delete key!",0
(👌🏻): Impecable el produlto,0
"(Do not buy this computer, it's garbage. Look at the 1 start reviews for the truth about it.): This is a piece of garbage after about 8 uses. Battery over heated and will not turn on. I've used it very little bit had it for more than 30 days, what a waste of $400. Get the 2 year protection plan if you dare buy this POS.",0
"(No MUX): I wanted so badly to give this 5 stars but it has no MUX switch! I don't know how you miss something so important on your flagship laptop when your lower end models have it, but it's a huge oversight by Gigabyte.I love the feel of the mechanical keyboard, the RGB is nice and bright, although it seems to constantly change back to the default RGB profile causing you to have to go back into the app to change it back to what you had it set to. But overall the keyboard is just an absolute pleasure to type with and game on. My End key wasn't quite seated all the way in, but one firm press and it was good to go. The keyboard isn't overly loud like don't mechanical keyboards, but it's by far my favorite part of this laptop.The 3080 in it is actually very capable even though it's only 105w when boosted. I've not run into any issues with any games I've played and since it's only a 1080p display you'll always be above 60fps in any game where fps matters, and with it being a lower watt GPU that definitely attributes to this laptop always feeling as cool as it does.The case feels very nice and sturdy. I'm a truck driver and it feels extremely durable in such an environment. It doesn't get hot at all really, but the fans are rather loud under load. Not an issue for me as if I'm playing something that taxes the system that hard, I'm using a headset anyway. But the feel and texture of this metal they used on the case feels fantastic to me and just makes it feel like a more upscale laptop.The battery life is, well, it's a gaming laptop. You won't be using this thing on battery power except in a pinch. But if you do find yourself needing to, there is a battery saver mode that I've gotten 3 easy hours out of watching movies on a flight, but if you're planning on gaming on battery power for whatever reason, there are better options. That's not what this device is suited toThe screen quality is good. Not great but good. Colors are decent, and there's several different color temp profiles so you can customize it somewhat, and you can calibrate it if needed but mine was fine out of the box. The big issue with the screen is the response time. At higher refresh rates you will see some ghosting I've noticed, as is the price you pay with an IPS monitor. It's not bad, but coming from my previous laptop is definitely noticeable and something to keep in mind. I've not noticed any backlight bleed which is really impressive for an IPS monitor.Overall, for the price I paid, ($2149) it's a fantastic value for the money, except for that ONE THING... No MUX switch. An absolutely inexcusable oversight in 2022 on a flagship gaming laptop, and the one thing holding it back from a 5 star rating.",0
"(Terrible keyboard): I really wanted to like this Chromebook. Good price. Adequate (but not great) display. Long battery life. But the keyboard just kills it for me. Somebody in the design group decided to increase the key spacing so that the keyboard fills the entire space. It's terrible. The keys are much further apart than on my ThinkPad and my multiple mechanical keyboards. Trying to hit backspace just gives me ""="". I just can't manage to type on this thing.I wish I could find a good replacement for my old Asus Transformer tablet & keyboard. I was hoping a Chromebook would fill the bill, but I am very disappointed.",0
"(Muy buen equipo!!!): muy buen equipo! funciona perfecto y la verdad me sorprendieron las bocinas se escuchan super bien y muy fuerte. Excelente compra, realmente la recomiendo!!",0
(M1. Macbook is great and does what I need.....): I ordered the Macbook to use for my model railroad. I now use it as my portable computer. it is small and powerful........,0
"(Great computer, battery needs work): Other then battery life this thing is awesome. No complaints, lightning fast, never had a single problem with anything as of yet. Would like the battery to last more then a few hours but it could also be everything I have running on the computer. Overall I would recommend this to my friends and family",0
"(2022 MacBook Air): Fantastic laptop, best laptop I’ve ever owned.",0
"(Perfect for gaming): My teen purchased this , and loves it, she is a hardcore gamer and this met all her needs",0
(It is great): Watching tv,0
(Great for college): Great computer for college. Small and effective. Short batter life though,0
"(DOES NOT TURN ON!!!!): I have just received the laptop but cant turn it on. It is charging, when i push turn on button it turns on and turns off immediately. I don’t recommend this product!",0
"(honestly, one of the worst laptops I've ever owned): As a preface, sometimes the 'N' and 'B' keys do't work, so I'm leaving I every mistake while I type just to show you how much of a icoveience this has ee.

The right angle power adapter cables (on both sides) always seem to get in the way and often yank the laptop dangerously,0
(Impressive lightweight system. Everything advertised): System arrived next day. Opened it up turned it on and after a few hours of standard updating the system was ready for use. Sound system was surprisingly good. Very speedy boot up. Keyboard light kept flashing until after the standard upgrades were applied. Recommend gladly.,0
(Great deal on this laptop. Will be used for laser and Silouette): Using for laser and Silhouette,0
"(Solid): Has run like a champ out of the box. Unpackaged and straight to Forza H4 for hours on end. Swapped in 32GB of RAM for $100, as the 8 was holding it back. The only con is the fans, otherwise very happy thus far.",0
"(poor quality.): aluminum chassis???? pure platic, poor quality... some burn pixels on the monitor also the network card is not working. Bad purchase... don't buy it.",0
"(Great!): Bought the 2022 model with 16 gigs. Play mostly league and older games to be honest, but I absolutely love the thing. It looks great- sleek but not obnoxiously gamer design. Web cam is pretty bad, but better then nothing- which is what most other gaming laptops in this price range will offer. Word of advice, avoid having the armory crate open while gaming, and make sure to let BIOS update to current before making a final judgement. I had performance issues prior to sorting out those two issues, but now it runs perfectly.",0
"(perfect for school): My son loves it, perfect for school!!",0
The packaging was very thorough and included a rather large microfiber cloth and ensured the laptop made it without any issues.,0
"(Really good laptop): Not gonna get technical, there are enough videos rating this laptop for that. Camara is meeh, average really, sound is really well, haven't gotten any BSOD yet so that's great, also love that I can turn on/off the camera. For the price is a really great offer and laptop. 100% recommended.",0
(Miss aligned fan horrible warranty support.): Damaged as soon as I got it. Fan keeps clicking sounds misaligned and ASUS support is deplorable wanting me to jump through diagnostic software when it is a physical issue.,0
(They're sending low quality Chromebooks): Be careful when buying they send low-priced Chromebooks and you will need Amazon's help to make a return,0
"(So pleased!): This has been a brilliant purchase, right out of the box. Our 9 yr old son has wanted one since he started using them at school, his tablet needed replacing, it is the perfect size and exactly what he needs, will compliment what he's doing at school, and he uses it for YouTube etc. Doesn't do much for games on it as we have an Xbox. He loves it. We've had excellent products from Dell in the past and this Chromebook doesn't disappoint.",0
(Some patience but worth the time): I'd like a little more info on paper to set up. Love the keys . Very fast for the price. Not a gamer so cannot comment on that aspect,0
(Five Stars): Great deal at the time,0
"(M1 has demolished all other Laptops. BEST ultrabook and all-around laptop of 2020-2022): Amazing quality from Apple. I was very sad to see some macbook airs go stray the past few years. Apple finally came back to its roots and built this masterpiece of a laptop. I have been a windows and mac user over the years, mostly being on windows. But the m1 has made it possible for me to make a complete transition. After going through laptops year after year, breaking down, and becoming outdated. I feel confident with m1 as my daily driver and I can run windows on it. Absolutely amazing. No reason to buy any other laptop right now.",0
"(Fantastic Chromebook!): I purchased this for my son so he had his own computer for home schooling during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is fantastic, great size, no issues starting it up or signing him in. He even said it was like the ones he uses at school. It will be great for the following years so he has his own.",0
(It’s a winner!!): First MacBook and I am in love! I have been using my computer for two days and still have 60% battery life. Very impressive because I have been using it a lot. I’m still getting use to the different feel on how to use it but it really is self explanatory once you start using it.,0
"(Too many ads): Why am I bombarded with ads I dont want, when paying $600 for a laptop. Isnt that enough money?",0
"(Great buy!): Got this as a gift for someome who'll use it strictly for email and YouTube, but honestly I'm shocked by how good this laptop is! Everything is very responsive and I love the setup. Great laptop!",0
"(Perfect for a creator - a lot of hardware for the money!): I got this exact configuration directly from D e|| (Core i9 12800H, RTX 3070 Ti, 32GB RAM), and thought I'd share impressions here.As a creator (and not a gamer), I do video and photo editing on this machine, mostly connected to an external monitor and plugged into wall power. In this context, this machine with its specs is probably the best value of 2022 from a major brand name that is broadly available online.You can find various online reviews of this machine (or its closely-related 2022 G15 relative), so I won't rehash anything really here. But I would just offer these salient points that aren't immediately obvious in some reviews:The (major) high's for me:(1) The CPU and GPU are allowed to run high in their power thermal envelopes, so you're getting a lot of performance for this combination of hardware.(2) The 2022 G16 has a 16:10 screen, which is superior for creation and productivity versus the 2022 G15's 16:9.(3) The included 2x16GB DDR5 RAM sit in two slots that are user-upgradeable to 2x32GB when I'm ready.The (minor) low's for me:(1) The single USB-C Thunderbolt port does not support Power Delivery, so you're stuck using the included brick and barrel power jack for power.(2) There is no connector on the motherboard for a second M.2 PCIe SDD. They seemingly removed this capability in 2022, though the 2021 G15 did have this.(3) The trackpad is laughingly small given how big this laptop is. They could have pushed the keyboard higher on the deck to make more room below the keyboard for a bigger trackpad.(5) When using high performance settings, unsurprisingly, the fans sound like a passenger jet taking off.(6) The included Dell and Alienware configuration software are unsurprisingly slightly buggy. For example, settings don't always ""stick""; the laptop charges up to 100% even when I set it to stop charging, say, 80%; and pressing keyboard backlight button sometimes doesn't do anything until I load up the Alienware config software again.In my view, the high's far and away outweigh the (minor) low's, especially for how I use the machine.",0
"(Short Battery Life): I didn't expect the battery life to be so short. This is my first laptop so I'm not sure if it's a trade-off from all the other great features, or if that's how gaming laptops are due to the system's demands. Besides that, I love it! I'm currently in tech school and it's working amazingly for my work and the few pc games I play. I 10/10 recommended this to my friends with the note that the battery life only lasts about 5 hours at 100% with the highest setting on for power saving.",0
"(Beautiful and Fast): For the things described in the product main page, it does absolute everything!!! must buy for a great cheap price, and great specs for that price, just add an SD Card and get that storage edge you need and you are just set for your daily tasks.",0
"(Think Twice About Buying an ASUS!): I bought the ASUS Zen Book less than two months ago and its completely dead! I just mailed it in for repair. Not sure how that will turn out, but in over 20+ years of using various PC's this is the first time I've had one go completely dark. The error message before it went dark was ""Driver Power State Failure"". Beware!",0
(Just right): Wasn't looking for a super fast gaming laptop or anything heavy duty. Been working from home like most of us and really needed to upgrade. Pleasantly surprised with quality and price point.,0
(Defective Screen): Screen would not turn on after sleep mode,0
(Five Stars): Has worked well and would recommend it to a friend.,0
(Great gaming laptop.): This is my first gaming laptop and I love it! The screen quality is crazy clear 1080p. It’s perfect for gaming and it’s fast no lagging at all or any sign of slowing down. The battery life is standard. It’s fast powering up as well! This is by the most greatest gaming computer I bought.,0

"(Not As Advertised - Read This Before You Order!): Ordered the Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 (Model XE520QAB-K02US) as a replacement for my Samsung Chromebook Pro which I passed on to my wife because her 6-year old Samsung Chromebook was no longer receiving updates. Received it yesterday and was shocked to see that it has an Intel Core m3 7th Generation processor (see photo of label) and not the 8th Generation depicted in Amazon's advertising. (See Screenshot) Also surprised that entire case is plastic, including the keyboard deck. From what I understand this originally came with metal top and keyboard deck with plastic bottom. All plastic makes it very flexible and it just feels cheap, more like a $200 chromebook and not the build quality you'd expect in a chromebook in this price range. Will be sending back, expecting a full refund because it is not as advertised.",0
(Buy it!): This Chromebook is great. Takes some getting used to vs. a windows pc but is much better than they are,0
(The memory was to small for my needs. It wouldn't install turbo tax.): nice for small programs.,0
"(Great): purchased this for my son's bday, he loves it",0
"(No base warranty): I have purchased lenovo laptops for years and usually add an extended warranty after purchase. These laptops do not come with a base warranty and Lenovo will not add them. This means you will not be able to extend the warranty at standard prices. You will have to pay for a ""post warranty"" which is more expensive and is only available for 1 or 2 years.",0

"(More care is needed for the out of box experience): For the most part, Asus did a good job in creating a reliable and enjoyable laptop with the Vivobook ""Pro"" 14. I put ""Pro"" in quotations because other than the selling page here on Amazon and on Asus' website, there is no ""Pro"" mention once you get the actual computer, other than it comes with Windows 11 Pro. But that's not a big deal.What is a big deal, or certainly a noticeable one, is the out of box experience. The laptop arrived with ZERO PERCENT charge. For a second I thought I had gotten a DOA laptop, but it came to life the moment I plugged it in. And what's the deal with that huge brick-on-a-leash charger for a 14-inch laptop? I was working with a customer at work who has a 17-inch Vivobook laptop and had a much smaller charger than my 14-inch model. Anyway, after going through all the initial Windows 11 setup, I was told the computer needed to download the upgrade to Windows 11. What?! I thought I was already using Windows 11. Oh well... The whole out of box experience was kind of messy, but the computer has been great once past that point.",0
"(Buena laptop,pero su relación calidad-precio está mala.): Recién me acabo de comprar esta laptop, y está buena para lo que ofrece, y como lo que yo busco es trabajar en ella y jugar uno que otro juego ligero me parece buena. Eso sí, solo me la compré porque prime me dió un buen descuento por ella, no creo que la hubiese comprado sin eso, ya que está cara para lo que es. No tiene teclado iluminado.",0
"(A great all-around little laptop): TL;DR: This is a fantastic machine in almost every way that matters. It's not a gaming laptop, but you can play a lot of mid-spec games just fine. It's an awesome business device, and it can handle just about anything that would be considered ""heavy"" use at home.I like my laptops on the small side. I was big into ""netbooks"" back in the day, and rarely aim for a screen size over 13 inches. More often than not those criteria mean that I'm stuck with something that's underpowered and underwhelming. Not so with this little beauty.The processor, memory, etc. are all top notch, but you can see that from the listing. I'm guessing if you've read this far, you've probably done some research already on the ""hard"" specs, and now you want the more touchy-feely impressions.So here goes: Getting it out of the box, everything screams quality, from the packaging itself to the shiny aluminum chassis to the slightly rubberized wrist area that helps hold your hands in position for typing. The screen goes almost edge to edge, with only about 1/2 cm lost to the bezel on each side. Turning it on for the first time was ridiculously fast, and even during setup everything felt snappy and responsive, whether I was using the keyboard and track pad or the touch screen. Both support all of the standard touch / pinch / etc. controls that we've all gotten used to. The touchscreen is responsive enough that I haven't fat-fingered anything on it yet, which happened often with some of my ""budget"" machines. Even better, the screen must be made of something that repels oils, since I haven't had to clean smudges off of it nearly as often as my last laptop (or my phone, for that matter).On that subject, even on the highest battery optimization settings the screen is colorful and bright. Everything I've watched or done on it looks sharp and rich. That said, the screen doesn't angle back as much as I'm used to, so unless it's sitting on something on my lap, it can look a bit washed out unless I hold it at the right angle. That doesn't seem to be a problem from the sides, just from above. The sound is also surprisingly good for something this tiny. I listened to a few music videos on it at around half volume, and my wife could hear it clearly downstairs. I think they might even be louder and clearer than the ones on her gaming laptop.Speaking of gaming, like I said, this isn't a gaming laptop, but the integrated Intel Iris graphics keep up surprisingly well for anything short of current gen AAA games. If you're playing within your specs, the image is sharp and clear, with no tearing or artifacting or anything else that would show the machine is falling behind. It also does a good job when used as a base machine hooked up to a larger monitor. Since I don't tend to do a lot of processor-heavy tasks like video editing, my other benchmark for use has been editing and slicing files for 3D printing. Files that took 30 or more seconds on my 4 year-old HP Elite Book with 8gb RAM and a core i5 processor take literally a few seconds on this Dell. My largest file of a dragon that took around 3 minutes before was done in less than 20 seconds.Do keep in mind that this machine only has 2 ports for whatever you want to connect to it, one on each side. That said, they're both USB-C Thunderbolt ports, so a decent docking station can take care of any peripherals. Also, as a bonus, this means that you can plug the USB-C charger into either side, which solves one of my own annoyances with a lot of other machines. Maybe it's just me, but having the charger on the ""wrong"" side for however I'm sitting just throws me completely off, and I love not having to deal with it here. There's also a micro-SD reader for more memory, and a 3.5mm jack for headphones.If I had to find anything to nit-pick, it would be the keyboard. The keys are nice and responsive, even though the travel is kind of shallow. But successfully making the bezel on the screen so small means the real estate available for the keyboard feels (to me at least) just a tiny bit cramped. I can still type my usual 70wpm, but I make a couple more errors than I do on a full keyboard, especially on any keys my pinkies hit. I also have to take an extra second when I need to use the 'delete' key (which I just did while typing ""delete"") because instead of being in the upper right corner like on most laptops, it's one key in from that. The upper right corner is the power key, which has caused me a headache or two when typing too fast. They wisely made that key just a bit ""stiffer"" than the rest, so a casual press won't shut off whatever you're doing, but I've still managed it a few times in around a week of use.Battery life is good, even when I turned off all the battery saver options. I've used it unplugged for 4-ish hours and still had more than 1/3 battery life left. Heat management is also good; it gets warm on my lap after 30 minutes or so, but it's never been uncomfortably hot. Wi-Fi 6 is amazing if you have a router that can keep up with it. Even graphics-heavy pages load in blink-and-you'll-miss-it times.So again, this machine is just awesome for anything but hardcore gaming. The price is an investment in a no-hassle everyday experience, with several perks thrown in. You won't be disappointed.",0
"(Wonderful! With a few wishes for next time): Pros:The screen is awesome. I really can make use of the extra 240 lines in height.Quiet - I put the fans on the low noise option and it's wonderfulFast! Both computationally and moving stuff off of external SSD.Supports extending to external 4K monitor, and GPU's work there.Cons:[These are really minor, but I wanted to put them here hoping that ASUS will read them, and for some it may be useful]1) I am right handed. My mouse lives on the right side of my laptop. I wish the power and HDMI cables, and high speed USB-C, could be on the left side, away from my right hand and mouse. See picture. But if you are left handed - this layout is a winner. [I've ordered a right angle HDMI cable to help]Update: I found a great video cable, look for Flexible HDMI to HDMI Cable Left Angled 90°, it made a big difference.2) The touch pad is a full inch below the space bar. For those of us who have trained on using the touchpad, we want to be able to use it with your thumb, while keeping our palms and fingers in typing position. On my previous laptop, it was only 3/8"". I'm still able to work the pad, so I'm not subtracting from the stars, but if you have smaller hands, you might want to check this, if you want to use it this way. Also -- I think this is one of those things with the visual appeal took precedence over the user comfort. I really want the designers to consider this use case.",0
(Awesome): Awesome piece,0
(Touch Screen Stopped Working): I like the computer but the touch screen started acting up less than 2 years after purchase. It was like something was constantly touching the screen and it would open a bunch of tabs without me even touching the computer. I contacted Dell but they wanted me to spend a hundred dollars to diagnose the computer. Don't waste your money!,0
"(Satisfied customer): Delivery was quick 👍🏼 Love the device, but brightness & speaker quality could be better.",0
"(Id Pass On This If I Were You): This laptop is unbelievably slow. The screen was not as advertised and my Dell from YEARS and YEARS ago that was cheap when I bought it has a better screen. I only kept it because they gave me what I thought was a really good deal, but honestly Im just going to give this away. This isnt even good enough to surf the web and watch Youtube on. Battery life is great though, atleast.",0
"(Treat!): Great machine, thank you!",0
(Only 1 downside): Low capacity graphics card but powerful,0
(Great lapto): Loved everything about it besides the battery life.,0
"(Total Lemon!): I purchased for my 11-yr old daughter for school. It has been nothing short of a huge mistake and I regret buying this for her. At three months, it started shutting off one automatically on a full charge. Now, she continues to get ""Chrome OS is missing or damaged."" Please insert a recovery USB stick or SD Card."" I have gone through the full recovery (total hassle) and it continues to crash and repeat itself.I strongly suggest to purchase the protection plan as HP's only offers 90-day warranty. The issues started right after 90 days...of course!I am returning to where I purchased the protection plan and hopefully, they can help me by replacing with a functioning computer.",0
(Worst laptop): It does not work properly. This laptop is very very slow. I do not purchase from hp anymore.,0
(Five Stars): I ordered this for my daughter so she can use it to school. She loves it,0
"(Crashes frequently; sometimes 2-3 times in 8 hours. Battery SUCKS!): i use this laptop daily for well over a year. this laptop works but is overpriced.can play cyberpunk 2077 on HIGH settings, but the laptop crashes during gameplay.Crashes frequently; sometimes 2-3 times in 8 hours. all updates are complete.i will charge the battery the night before, turn off and battery will be dead the next day/will not boot without power... will never buy an asus product again.",0
(Size): Thank you. My package came a day early. Everything works amazing i love this product will review in 3 months,0
"(Great gaming laptop): Runs smooth, great screen quality, and unless you’re installing a ton of large size games the 512GB SSD is good. It’s got it’s quirks- this is the first gaming laptop I’ve had that makes weird noises and physically lags a bit when you unplug it while using it, and I’ve noticed some instances (once a month or so) of graphical weirdness while watching videos online where things will get blurry and require a restart to fix itself- but for a gaming laptop with a 3060 at a decent price it so far seems like a winner. Great for someone who likes to keep up with a few new games every year and wants a machine that can handle that, though more hardcore folks may want to get something a bit bigger on the memory front.",0
"(not worth it): When you first start using it, keeps the internal temp cool but after a month of usage I noticed the cool wasn't working anymore my laptop GPU and CPU would reach 96°C which is it's max so it's a good starter laptop but not good for long term gaming and the main issue is too keep your fps counter up while gaming you have to keep the laptop always plugged in and after a while the actually power plug part that is inserted into the laptop will over heat and it will continue to say it's plugged in and then unplugged even when the cord is plugged into it 3/10 would not buy again",0
(Five Stars): My son is happy with it,0
(Four Stars): 8 year old used it.,0
(Un portátil excepcional con un precio muy reducido): Si buscas un portátil potente por un bajo precio y de alta calidad esta es tu elección. Muy buen acabado con buenas temperaturas que no superan los 80 grados Celsius en modo turbo. Los materiales son de aluminio y algunas partes de plástico.,0
(Easy to use): Easy to use. Battery lasts long.,0
(Very happy with purchase): Going from a first generation i7 quad core to a ninth generation hex core has been quite a leap forward and really enjoy the computer.,0
(I don’t know!): It’s gift to my niece on her graduation!,0
"(Wonderful, love everything about it, meets all my daily computer needs): Love everything about my new laptop. I do all my work based on Google Drive, so this computer is a dream. It is also easy to download programs that allow you to work and edit PDFs (also convert to excel and docx when you need) and you can save files to the computer as well. Quiet keyboard, relatively light to transport, sleek design. If you need a laptop for daily use for Internet, email, writing and editing in Google Drive (including sheets, PowerPoint, and word), and working with PDFs, this is the perfect computer.",0
"(Easy to use , slim takes very little space on my desk): I am in love with my lap top , slim and very easy to use .",0
"(Touchscreen laptop): Love this laptop! Battery lasts a while , it’s very light & fast!",0
(Great value): Everything expected and more.,0
(You can unlock your screen with your finger print :)): Very performed Laptop...Very fast/Light weight for the people who travel a lot. Very happy with my purchase.,0
(Five Stars): It' a really nice laptop,0
"(Description incorrect/deceiving): This laptop comes with Windows 10 in S Mode. No where in the description does the seller even mention that. Windows 10 in S Mode locks you down- have to use Edge, have to use Bing, can't install anything unless you get it from the Microsoft Store. Very Unhappy!!! I thought I was buying a real laptop not an imitation Chromebook. Do not buy this unless you want to be very limited on it's use. Spend a little more and get a REAL computer.",0
"(Surprisingly Enjoyable): One of our windows laptops was unbearably slow (especially with windows 10 now) so we bought one of these as a spare for the kids to use. And it's surprisingly fast/responsive and ENJOYABLE to use. No it is not a premium machine but the screen, snappy response and 10 HOUR battery are great. And it's so light it makes our other laptops seem like rocks. My main machine has to be windows, but would definitely buy another of these in the future as surfing device, light work, email, kids school work, ect.",0
(Lightweight): Has Alexa and Xbox,0
"(Great laptop): Great laptop for the price, wish it had a larger SSD drive. I talked two of my friends into buying this laptop also.",0
"(Does not have ethernet port, sd card compatabile.): This product works. The only time i experience slow speeds is when I don't have coverage or a signal. Sometimes buffering stalls but overall it is a nice product.",0
"Fast multitasking, it runs games well.",0
"(Great laptop): I bought this for my wife to play some of her games on. She loves it! It is fast, and the graphics are amazing. Battery life is a little low IMO, but it is a gaming laptop, so battery life is not a big concern.",0
(This isn't what it was adverted.): I brought this item under the information that this could serve as laptop for at least minimal gaming usage. I was not aware of the Chrome OS not being able to download anything other than what the company provides and it's very limited. I at least wanted to play the games I brought with steam but I can't download that either so.,0
"(Amazing Laptop for the price, I would say best Price/Specs ratio): This machine is amazing! Really fast, works very well for gaming as well as day-to-day tasks! Only downturn is the keyboard, it really stinks! REALLY, big time, if you are used to good keyboards, I would not recommend this computer. If you can move past that, then this laptop is for you. It doesn't bother me that much since I use a second screen with a USB-HUB for a mechanical keyboard, but could be annoying for some people.Besides that, I would also recommend upgrading the RAM to 16 gb minimum as well as getting a SSD to mount in this machine, it really bring a great machine to become fenomenal!",0
(Its ok): It worked,0
(Not to heavy): I love it very light,0
"(Just What I Needed): This computer is exactly what I needed. I wasn’t looking for anything fancy. I have an external hard drive so memory wasn’t an issue. I just needed a laptop that was light, had Microsoft office software and could get on the internet. It works perfectly for my needs. As long as you aren’t expecting a laptop with all the extra bells and whistles, it will do its job!",0
"(Monitor broke within a year): We have many chrome books in our household and this has been the worst one. The performance has been mediocre the most since we bought it a year ago. It has been always slow and laggy. And the quality always felt quite cheap. So today, the monitor stopped working. Basically made it impossible to use the laptop anymore. We ended up wasting 300+ dollars. Not happy at all. I’d say stay a way from it unless you want to waste your money.",0
"(Todo perfecto... excepto la camara): Todo muy bien, es lo que ves y funciona como debe... solo la camara esta situada en el lugar mas inservible, justo abajo de la pantalla por alguna razon..",0
"(Love this notebook!): I recently migrated to Apple after many years using a wide variety of PCs running Windows or Linux. I decided to make that move after Apple's introduction of the M1 processor, which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform. Now. of course, the M2 has been released, but, depending on your needs, the 2020 Macbook Air with the M1 will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware. You can search the Internet for professional reviews of the Macbook Air, but I feel confident you'll find plenty to verify what I'm saying.The Retina display is beautiful. The sound system is superior to any other laptop I have owned or used. The battery holds up all day under typical use, and I can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off. The Apple OS (Monterey) is smooth and fast, and I was able to learn my way around in it quickly. When you need help, a Google search will yield tons of tips quickly, or you can avail yourself of Apple support.I will say that the Air is a little short on USB ports, lacks a built-in card slot, and, of course, is not equipped with a touchscreen. However, I have run a USB hub from one of the two Thunderbolt ports, and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readers...even a portable DVD-burner. As far as a touchscreen goes, I have that on a Dell laptop I run Linux on, but I never use it...guess I'm a mouse or touchpad guy.The aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished, the keyboard has a very nice touch, the battery seems to charge quickly, and the Air is light at under 3 lbs.One last thing! I have been a heavy user of both Google and Microsoft services, and I have found that Apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the Mac environment. I run Google's Backup and Sync and Microsoft's OneDrive with no problems. My AVG subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both Mac OS and Windows machines.I have no regrets for this purchase. Actually, the Air was my 3rd M1 Mac. I also have an iMac and a Mac Mini. They all work together very well!",0
(Love my Apple laptop): Best ever,0
"(No MUX switch and defaults to integrated GPU but a good laptop): With more storage, a MUX switch or less problems with the integrated graphics, it would be great. Still good for its money, though.",0
(Samsung fan#1): love it the best its small cute and it does my work for school I would of been awesome if it was touch screen..,0
(Mad and upset): I didn't know that it was a 2018 model. I would like to return it. It was presented as new. I am very upset.Let me know what I need to do.,0
"(Very Nice Machine, but Very Limited): It is a nice machine, but, not what I needed . Very important to understand that it is a Google Chrome OS platform (I did not) and you are somewhat very limited to Google App's and system. You cannot run any windows or any other type platform or programs, App's and games. They have a okay support center and will tell you they are working on making the chromebook able to run other type App's , but when?. Google has a very good secure type system and that seems to be what is at issue with adding other programs, app's, games, etc..",0
"(Blue Screens frequently, manufacturer doesn't allow resets): I bought this laptop and have been using it for about 9 months. Immediately after I bought it, it would start blue screening while in use (almost always due to kbclass.sys despite the fact that the keyboard is built-in) and then would not start up for 2-3 days. The manufacturer has blocked resets and I can't reset the PC from the cloud, from a USB device, or from the local file system.Don't buy this laptop.It breaks and is unfixable.",0
"(Arrived with NO OPERATING SYSTEM): ""Chrome OS is missing or damaged. Please insert recover USB stick or SD Card"". This is what I see when I open my Samsung Chrome OS book for the very first time. Rock on, Samsung. Way to not impress me.",0
"(Good Gaming Laptop): The build quality seems very good. The laptop is very fast, and games run well. The only complaint is it should have an access door on the bottom for SSD's and Ram. The included 500g is too small and adding another is very difficult.",0
"(High End Chromebook passes all my expectations): I have one of the earliest Chromebooks by Asus and I loved it. After years of heavy use, I have worked it to retirement. My other experience has been all Microsoft/Windows/Office, lovely but clumsy and ditsy with semi-incomprehensible directions. This Chromebook is all Google by Samsung, simple and intuitive to use. Instead of Office, it offers the same word processing and database spreadsheet, etc., with easily identifiable icons instead of the glitzy ribbon. It has all I need plus much more. And it all goes to the cloud, where nothing has been lost yet!I love the model with two cameras, converts to tablet, with notepad and stylus or tablet keyboard. Or I can use it as a tablet style internet connection. Loaded with (mostly) Google apps and extensions, everything I need is available.At first I feared there was no way to Zoom, but zoom.us has an app for Chromebook that looks better than my PC's.I recommend this for especially for students and people looking for a first time computer. And for those of us who've known this secret for a longer time! Note also, Samsung offers less expensive models with the same essentials. I just wanted some sparkle in my life!",0
"(ASUS doesn't like reviews): I will start with the initial review that I submitted to ASUS. The review was rejected for unknown reasons.Excellent computer, especially for the price. It was on sale for Black Friday from an authorized seller. If one is looking for an ultraportable, the concerns that it is heavy and could have better battery life are legitimate. However, that is not the purpose of this device. It is rather lightweight. and a great computer for productivity. It has beautiful aesthetics and is solid. In summary, the computer is excellent for its intended purpose.",0
"(Good enough): It really delivers on everything promised, it is comfortable and with good power, the only problem as always is the cooling system. I have two fans to cool the laptop, but in addition to that and that the battery is not very durable, it really is a laptop that is worth it, and more if you can find it at a discount as was my case.",0
"The model I bought has the most amount of RAM available and combine that with the video card, this is this best one on the market",0
(Nice!!): Perfect for work!!,0
(Five Stars): amazing. great product you should get it now,0
"(Espectacular): La verdad la agarre en un buen precio, menos de lo que esta actualmente y no me arrepiento de cada peso invertido, la verdad vale la pena completamente.",0
"(Great basic laptop!): Great little laptop for basic needs! My husband has an HP Omen for photo editing and things like that, I was just looking for something small to surf the web and respond to emails. This is perfect. I've only used it for a few evenings, but so far it's well worth it's reasonable price tag!",0
"(Battery Life): Intense gaming, battery only last a little over an hour. Need plugged in if gaming longer.",0
"(Love, Love, Love?!): Love, love, love! I'm not using it for gaming. Just wanted something with more power. It's so quiet, you don't know it's running! Its so fast, I couldn't believe it. Love the light up keyboard and everyone about this laptop. Couldn't be happier!",0
(Very strong computer): Great producr,0
(features): good,0
"(Awful laptop, do yourself a favor and buy something else): Bought this laptop several months ago and have noticed numerous problems:-keyboard is malfunctioning and mistyping keys/glitching-fingerprint scanner doesn't work-screen quality is poor, hard to watch videos/movies. Too much reflection-lenovo in general does not have good customer service-heats up and is really loud-speakers are low quality-laptop performance is not at full capacity or as good as it should be-wifi keeps coming and going",0
(Do not purchase this item): After four months the battery refused to hold a charge so it doesn't matter how good it works we can't turn it on anymore.,0
"(Great features for price but problematic.): Bought this for my son three years ago and had to RMA it within 2 months of purchase, it stopped charging 2 days ago and now I'm waiting to find out the cost of repair. ASUS has been my go-to for desktop components but I'm hesitant to buy another laptop from them again.",0
When you plug in the charger there is a static sound coming from the laptop,0
(Battery won't charge): After 2 months battery won't hold chargeNow it won't turn on at all,0
"(Laptop super SLOW, then crashed!!!!): I was very much enthusiastic about my laptop. It worked well for a short bit but then it started to move extremely slow... Taking forever to load up. Storage isn't as advertised because I have no more than 30 videos downloaded and it's behaving as if it's out of storage.After a couple months, I used it one morning and shut down, then went back to the laptop within a hour or so after shutting down to proceed with what I was doing earlier, but the laptop started up to the point for me to put in my password and then froze at that point and wasn't responding to the cursor or any of the keys touched. After turning it off and then back on, I got a message that booting device cannot be found, among others (See images)... And it isn't responding to any of the actions tried in restoring. That's how it has been since.",0
(Do Not Buy): This was a waste of money. It is very restricted and restricting. It locks the Usenet into chrome etc.,0
"(Excelente.): Impecable, excelente.",0
(Excelente maquina!!): Su rapidez y precio,0
(Love): Love this. Works great for me.,0
(Best MacBook Air ever?! Minus the fingerprints?): Absolutely love this computer. No issues with it at all. I think upgrading to the 512g is worth it. It’s an expensive computer only to have the base model at 256g. It’s a great every day computer!,0
"(Not a good laptop): Worked good for a couple months then starting automatically turning right in the middle of me doing homework or playing a game. I'm very annoyed, I heard so much good things about this brand laptop and none of it seems to be true. Maybe I just got a defective one.",0
"(Highly suggest !!): Quick start up and fingerprint sensor is arguably more reliable than that of a cellular device. Screen is not as bright as a more expensive laptop but is bright enough to still find myself squinting when I open it at night. Smooth running, decent battery, overall a VERY good budget laptop!!",0
"(Reasonable price and OKay performence): 1. It is reasonable price ($1349) for laptop with RTX 3070.2. The model of RTX 3070 is the lowest end version, which the boost clock is 1290 MHz.3. Number of heat pip is not enough. Especially the CPU heat pipe. The CPU and GPU temperatures are 85 C, 80 C while playing 3A game.4. The VBIOS with Higher TDP exist, which allows set higher TDP. In my tested case is about 10% increasing performance, which the TDP increase From 85 to 95 and the temperature of GPU from 80 to 86C.(I only tested for a short time, then i reflashed the VBIOS back to original version).5. The Battery only lasts 2 hours without heavy running.6. The color of the monitor is not sharp, which worse than majority IPS in the market.7. My result of 3D Mark is 8330 points without overclock.",0
It was so easy to transition from consoles and im happy to leave the glitches behind.,0
"(5 dead pixel warranty ruins the whole deal): While the laptop SHOULD be a banger, Acer's refusal to back it's products with a decent warranty means risk is on the consumer to actually get what you ordered. They only fix the monitor if there are 5 dead pixels, 4? Out of luck. People shouldn't have to spend $1300 so they can hope there aren't ANY dead pixels. Fool me once...Update: today my friend was about to spend $2600 on a 3080ti Predator laptop but when I told him about the pixel policy he bought something else. Hope it was worth it, Acer!",0
(Dissatisfaction.): The laptop was delivered with a faulty ( power pack) Charger. I thought it was faulty and almost returned it.,0
"(Minecraft at 1000 FPS <3): This thing is a monster...Pros:- Several hundred dollars cheaper than similarly-spec'd gaming laptops- Doesn't LOOK like a gaming laptop, just looks like a normal laptop- Advertised the RAM as being 2933MHz, but mine is running 3200MHz- Yes, running vanilla Minecraft + Optifine gave >1000 FPS with default settings. What more could you want in life?Cons:- Battery life is only 2-3 hours, but nobody's perfect (:",0
(Love it): I love it,0
"(Great all around Ultrabook): I use this Ultrabook as my main PC both at home and on the road. At home I connect it to an external 32"" monitor via the HDMI connecter and work from there (popping open the lid when I turn it on to access the excellent fingerprint reader, then closing it again afterwards). The boot up time on this (after cleaning off all the crapware of course) is incredible. 7-8 seconds from power on to asking for fingerprint. I bought this knowing it was not a gaming PC, but it can run things like World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and some steam games fine, but things like Overwatch are about the max it can handle (and then only at low settings). Overall, one of the best laptops I have ever owned.",0
(Easy to use.): Granddaughters loved them. Are well made and work great.,0
(Light weight!): Bought this for my 10yr old daughter and she cant put it down!,0
"(Boot loop): after I update BIOS driver and graphic card driver, black screen boot loop happend.Tried everything but couldn't fix it.now refund is in progress.",0
"(Good value but gets hot.): This thing is a good value, especially when compared to today's massively inflated GPU prices. Hell, a video card I bought 4 years ago is worth more today than when I bought it.I find it performs well enough, I like the keyboard. Device feels sturdy. SSD is a big upgrade for anyone who hasn't had one before. This may be standard issue on modern laptops, but I quite like that the audio in and out are one port, so you can easily use an xbox style headset.My only gripe would be it has a terribly short battery life when being used for games. I guess that is kind of par for the course and that wouldn't be a problem but when plugged in and gaming, even with the fans on high and an additional fan from a base, the GPU hits 91 degrees and I unplug the power supply to lower the temp (it goes right down to 70 or so) I think the proximity of the gpu to the power supply is the problem, unfortunately.I worry over time that will shorten the lifespan.",0
it really takes hours to make it work,0
"(Repairs after an overheat issue which affected screen. Glitch screen, flickering, and runs poorly.): I've had trouble with this laptop since the day of purchase. Overheat issue which damaged screen and exterior. Repaired with purchased protection plan. Computer is now running horribly, glitching and flickering screen. No touch screen. Not a gamer so wouldn't know. Only have had it a little over a year for school.",0
"(First impression on Starlight.): I had windows before and now I have a Mac. This is a great purchase. The laptop made a big impression on me.The delivery: I was supposed to sign for it upon delivery and I never did. It was dropped off on my front doorstep. She caught me doing something with my hands full and wet, and I assume she had to be going to her next delivery to stay on schedule. Back to the Mac review.The M2 Air: What can I tell you? This thing is really small. Upon taking it out of its packaging, I held it in my hands and it felt like I was holding a composition notebook, but a tad bit lighter. It does not feel like holding an envelope like it was revealed back in the first Mac Air laptop. It was like holding a windows surface laptop, except lighter. The laptop turned on on its own and I set up everything in less than half an hour. I may miss right clicking with my old windows laptop, but holding down the scrolling pad is way easier on this thing. I learned the basics, the advanced internet tips and tricks, and the essentials in less than ten minutes. I picked up on everything in less than an hour. It took me longer to choose a password than anything else. Lol. But, it was simple. It runs really smooth and I hear nothing. It’s so silent, I tapped on the mute button and it does not give out one sound from the internal system. It’s easily the best laptop out right now.The one con I have: There are none aside from the fact that the typing on the keyboardis about the only noise you’ll pick up. Yes, the keyboard fret buttons sound plastic and rub on them and it sounds like an eerie screeching noise. In all retrospect, I’m not about to rub the keyboard. That’s not what it’s for.Video / Audio: I watched on Apple TV. The sound became better to my ears switching from watching an HD movie to a 4K movie. I watched The Blair Witch Project, the old film from 1999, then I put on the new Blair Witch movie that resolutes a picture of 4K and let me say that the audio on 4K sounds crispier than HD movies. I could hear the footsteps and environmental noises for full immersion. It was like I was in the movie. I watched it at night while everybody’s asleep. That movie scares the crap out of me. The picture was HD. The brightness was low. The sound was past halfway. It looked okay because Blair Witch Project has the female character video recording on an old camera. It looks like it looked the first time I watched The Blair Witch Project back in the year 2000. And I like that.Multi-tasking / browsing / usageSome sites like Yahoo take a while to catch up on uploading the page as I scroll further on some articles. I also encountered ads. I’ll have to use an ad-blocker. Battery life. The Mac was on for two hours and it dropped ten percent. All I did was setup and browsing. Then, I charged it by MagSafe charger. It took about less than 15 minutes to charge all the way up to 100% from 50% on first usage.Life expectancy: The 8gb ram should run well for the next 6 to 8 years. By then you and I or whoever chose this laptop will have upgraded in the next 5 years as technology further improves.And to size up my last thoughts… Oh yes, I used the box / case it came on as a laptop case to keep it stored at night so it won’t get dusty overnight. Simple as that. Put it back in its box. It’s brand new. You wouldn’t want to have a dirty starlight. Overall, if you have had an Apple device like a smartphone, tablet, or iPod touch back then, you’ll pick up on everything on your first go. Thanks for the read through on my review and to Amazon for this amazing machine. Farewell.",0
"(Buyer Beware! Poor Manufacturing and QC!): This is my second MSI laptop within a month. First, I ordered PS63 which has several cosmetic issues, but I could not return it since I saw these cosmetic problems after upgrading the memory and ssd. This Prestige 15 unit also has a problem on the chassis. The lid of the laptop won't close completely. There is a serious amount of gap between the lid and the chassis (Please see the pictures). Furthermore, the lid and chassis are unaligned. While the right front side of the lid falls behind the chassis towards back, left front aligned okay. If you press further after closing the lid, lid still goes 3-5 mm down. Overall PC has very good specs to be honest, but you get a visually problematic device which bothers you. If I pay $1400 to this machine, I HAVE TO get the machine in a good condition. I am fed up with quality issues of MSI laptops. MSI! please listen up, your laptops should not be like winning a lottery. I am returning the laptop. And please do not send a generic response to this message like below because this message does not solve anything on the consumers' end! Instead, improve your Manufacturing and QC not to cause people lose time and effort.""Dear Valued Customer,We are sorry to hear about the issues you experienced with the lid...BLA BLA BLA BLA......... If you have any further questions regarding this product or have any suggestions for improvement for us, please do not hesitate to contact us directly at usrma@msi.com and we will be more than happy to assist you.Thanks for choosing MSI!""UPDATE:There are 2 NVMe Drivers, BUT each use PCIe x2 which means the speed is limited to max 1600-1700 MB/s. So even if you add a Samsung 970 Evo/Plus/Pro you cannot get 3500/3000 MB/s Read/Write Speeds. This product is totally misadvertised. You cannot find this detail anywhere.",0
"(Mousepad Small, Mouse and Keyboard fragile): I bought this laptop about a year ago and a month after purchasing the mousepad stopped working. I had to use it more aggressively so that it may function which simply damaged the mousepad more. I use an external keyboard and mouse since two of the keys also stopped functioning. If the fan settings are set to auto, it is possible that the computer can burn you if you are running graphics intensive programs for long periods. There are times where the battery also discharges while the computer is plugged into the factory 90 Watt power supply.",0

He already uses an Android and has Google Play and a Google account. So, this was an easy transition for him.

I’m very happy with this so far this Dynabook is wonderful the only problem I’m having is finding a new AC adapter because we stepped on the one that we had and it is broken. Its not such an easy thing to find a replacement. We already ordered two that don’t fit. So we wrote to the questions section above. Hopefully they can assist us. Otherwise we really like it,0
(Battery Life): After 2 months I bought it and the battery does not last as in the beginning and that I have hardly used it. On the other hand it has a difference in the lower right corner and it seems that it is from the factory because I have seen that same detail in another pc.,0
"(Impressive for creative work not gaming.): Dell XPS 15 9500This is a magnificent 15.6 in laptop created for the creative professional. It is capable of gaming but does not accel in that field. The version I selected has the following hardware:- i7 10750H- GTX 1650 ti- 16GB RAM- 1TB SSD-86 WHr battery (good for 8-9 hours of normal internet surfing)Appearance:-The dimensions of this laptop are: H= .71” (18mm) W= 13.57” (344.72mm) D= 9.06” (230.14mm). It is 4.5 lbs (2.05 kg).-The chassis is made of CNC aluminum. The dell logo in the center of the lid is glossy.-The palm wrest is a soft black carbon fiber with a touchpad is 5.9” x3.5” which is similar to that of a MacBook.Display-The laptop has a 16:10 infinity-edge display.

"(Great light weight Business Laptop): Whether you use this laptop as a business or personal laptop it won't matter. The only reason you wouldn't make it your first choice as a personal laptop is the price. But if that is not an object and you demand a great laptop, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best choice. The only think I really find needed an improvement is the Fingerprint reader, it is very slow to recognize the print. My phone fingerprint reader works 10 times better. The only other think I would like to see was more options when selecting a touchpad monitor. Yes, I would recommend this laptop.",0

"(Worth the Upgrade): This laptop is blazing fast. It was a great upgrade from my three year old HP Omen. The only drawback is it can get decently warm in heavy use. The fan button is loud. If you're wearing headphones, you won't hear it much. I was cross shopping between this and the ASUS M15 from Best Buy. I am glad I went with the MSI. The vents are covered by a metal mesh, so it allows for a good cooling with a laptop cooler. I am happy with this purchase.",0

"(Buena laptop para trabajo de oficina, escuela, ver peliculas y cosas no tan pesada.): Nota: Al principio iba a devolverla porque parecía que tenía un error de tarjeta red (llegaba máximo 5% de bajada), pero cambié el módem y se arreglo el problema.Cosas que me gustaron:*La velocidad de inicio es buena, así como su velocidad de procesamiento y almacenamiento.*La cámara también es aceptable para reuniones o clases virtuales.*Es silenciosa, tiene sus momentos que necesita al máximo el ventilador, pero es cuando se usa buen tiempo.*Económica, a pesar de las cosas que no me gustaron sigue siendo una opción muy viable para el estudio, solo habría que cuidarla mucho.Cosas que no me gustaron:**RAM: Usa los dos slots de RAM, o al menos eso dice en el admin de tareas, lo cual debe ser 2x4 GB, por lo tanto, para aumentar la RAM se necesitará quitar una de esas y que sea mayor a 4 GB.*Software: Tiene W11 por defecto, lo cual quita 500 MB de RAM a comparación del W10 (OJO como esto es cosa de software no tiene que ver con la laptop, puede cambiarla sin perder garantía).*La carcasa se siente muy frágil así como la pantalla, parece que en cualquier caída podrá descomponerse o romperse la pantalla al doblarse por el impacto.*Puertos USB: Solo tiene 2 y por ende, si requieres esos dos puertos, comprar mouse o teclado BT.*Espacio vació, a pesar de ser compacto tiene un gran espacio sin uso en las esquinas inferiores.",0

"(A super hot gaming laptop! But, it does play well): I bought this laptop to be able to work remotely and also play call of duty world war II. I tried to make the best of the preloaded operating system with the stuff that was on there, but I did not like it. I downloaded the Windows 10 creation tool and put that on a USB. I booted to USB and did a clean install of Windows 10 home. Afterward I started utilizing this little beast to play call of duty. Let me tell you, I have never in my life seen a laptop get this hot! When I say hot I mean it will burn your freaking fingers! The panel center of the screen above the keyboard was so hot I could have literally fried a piece of meat on it! I'm not kidding! Luckily for me I had a five fan laptop cooling device that I plug into my USB and was able to put it underneath my laptop which yielded impressive cooling to this machine. Let me tell you it is still hot! But not so hot that it would burn you now. I am very worried that the heat that is generated from this machine will make it die too soon. Otherwise I am averaging a hundred and sixty three frames per second on call of duty world war II, I do not have the settings to max on anything because I want performance more than I want beautiful pictures. I hope this review helps some of you and especially I hope this helps the people at Acer so that they can design some type of better cooling system for future gaming rigs at this price point.",0

"(Priced a bit high for what it is.): So first, I am not taking the paid by MSI review thing. Yes most reviews here prob did.Some things other reviewers have said that I will echo. Yes the keyboard is REALLY flimsy, I didn't think it would be that bad but holy crap it is. Yes the fans are loud and high pitched. And no the laptop does not stay cool. Even under basic tasks it gets pretty hot to the touch.Other things that people should note if they are looking to buy this, first the default install is crap. It is slow and very sluggish for an i7 with 32GB of ram it should not be that slow. Seriously MSI what are you doing? If you wipe and do a fresh install(be warned you will need to have the wifi drivers predownload) it is a very nice experience.The real deal breaker for me and why I returned it, the USB ports are REALLY shallow. I keep a yubikey nano plugged in at all times, and if you look at the image you can see how flush it sits in the MBP but on the GS65 is sticks out way to much that I would be scared when putting it in a bag I would catch the yubikey and rip out the usb port or at least severely damage it.",0

"(There is alot to cover with this laptop): So again there is alot with this laptop, id strongly suggest that you read everything i have to say.i give this laptop a 5 star because its incredible, the control center it comes with is very bad though. i had to delete it to be able to run better frames, when i first got it i hopped on fortnite immediately since my desktop is only a 2060 i was exited to so what a 3060 can truly do, as i got on i i turned on max frames and loaded into creative, i was lagging decently and my frames where at 140-40. i get 200+ on my 2060 so at first my heart sunk, i was so worried because i got this laptop as a basic replacement for my pc so i could have a dual pc setup, but i didnt panic to much, i thought about the reviews and they said the control center worked terrible, after i uninstalled it, which only took my 2 minutes, i was getting 400-500 frames everywhere in the game, i spent 400 dollars for my 27 inch gaming monitor, 240hz, but i swear this monitor is alot better, i was not playing better though because i had switch set ups completely but i can tell ill get better with tis laptop, i bought it for 1299, which i do believe is the best price for a 3060 and an intel core i7 11800H and a 240 hz monitor, i couldnt find anything better and i looked for 3 months straight. some bad things about the laptop, is that the battery is so BAD!!! if you want to have a laptop for all day then you'll have to go into settings and turn the hz to 60, now i dont think i need a good battery, i mean its actually not bad its just that its a gaming laptop its not meant to be unplugged for 9 hours straight, also the camera, the camera is terrible, not only is it at the bottom of the screen but the colors and frame and resolution you get on the camera is terrible, i would recommend this laptop if your only choosing it because it has a camera lolOther then that, i do believe that this laptop is truly amazingBy your favorite YoutuberLove NAFIN",0

(Super Gaming Machine!): Really enjoying it,0
"(keyboard feels wonderful, as a basic gaming machine it does what ...): Fast, keyboard feels wonderful, as a basic gaming machine it does what I need at a price I can tack. I use it mainly to run multiple photo editting software, photoshop, ACDsee, some canon software and i like to run all at the same time. The processing power and graphic card is making that a breeze. I specialize in making pano's and merged photos for proper exposure and wanted a laptop that could do it without getting bogged down. This has it. Really fast, i can put together 15 raw photos (30mb size each) and while it's processing the photos still be processing batches of basic edits on my other software while I'm surfing the web and do it all with no glitches and it's fast. The flat, non glossy screen is doing a great job and showing me the correct colors also. Used the laptop to edit one set and then transferred my drive to my main calibrated monitor and was very pleased how accurate the match was. Excellent for a laptop monitor. I'll be satisfied to use the screen for such in a pinch to do quick edits and not worry I've made something nuclear or drab.",0

(Great Deal!): Purchased for a family friend that is a 1st year student in college. The item is refurbished but came looking flawless and the i5 really handles everything well.,0
(arrived with a non-functioning touchpad): I spent several days migrating my apps and data from a dying Dell laptop (SSD failing) using a USB mouse (because it is easier to deal with for complex screen picks than a touchpad). It was only then that I found that the touchpad was non-functional. Even when booted into BIOS the touchpad diagnostics would not function. Thanks HP (NOT) for selling me a lemon. Works well otherwise.,0
"(Happy but with a catch): There is a lot to love about this laptop including a beautiful, crisp display and great functionality. Glad I opted for the 16gb ram. Really speeds up my processing time using Adobe Lightroom. I spent a lot of time looking at laptop specs and appreciate that this one has two USB-A and one USB-C ports as well as HDMI. I really misread the port specs however and thought this had a SD slot but it only has Micro-SD which is practically useless. There are no adapters that take SD down to Micro-Sd. Lots of adapters that take Micro-SD to SD however. Not sure what the engineers were thinking. Now I have another adapter to buy. If engineers can put two SD slots in my DSLR it would seem they can put one in a laptop.",0

"(5/5 Buy buy buy!): So many good things to say. RTX 2070 and ""budget"" don't usually belong in the same product description. Somehow, MSI made it work with a super powerful gaming machine that kicks ass and. Well, for the budget-oriented high-end gamer, this is all you ever need.—————————PERFORMANCE - 5,555/5This is not something you need worry about on this laptop. This machine pulls 100+ the most AAA demanding titles at the highest settings, thanks to the full RTX 2070 mobile GPU (not Max-Q).My Frames in some FPS games (high/ultra settings, 1080p):Warzone: 90s-120sPlanetside 2: 140s (VR training), 60s-80s (huge fights)Apex Legends: 90-100sThe main performance ""bottleneck"" is the i7-10750h CPU, which is obvious when comparing with the stupidly powerful RTX 2070 graphics card. Also makes sense since the CPU hits the 90+ C while GPU hits 70s. That being said, hitting the above framerates in games, I can’t complain.—————————THERMALS - 4/5Totally competent. Runs a little hotter than I hoped for, but won't thermal throttle out of the box (default “User” mode in Dragon center with high CPU, auto fans).Undervolting with XTU can be unlocked in the Advanced BIOS settings. I played around with some sliders, but I couldn’t get better performance than stock settings. YMMV.The fans are LOUD. When gaming, air blasts out the back and right side. Hot air blasts out the left side. Don’t leave any accessories to bake next to this laptop, and you’ll be fine. Thankfully, the keyboard stays cool and comfortable during long gaming sessions.I give 4/5 because it’s not something you’d really notice.—————————SCREEN - 5/5Tech reviewers give the response time as 5 ms, close to the advertised 3 ms. Without a way to test for it myself, I’d trust this figure.144 hz refresh rate is buttery smooth to the eye and more than good enough for FPS and action games. The screen is has deep contrast, though it seems biased towards darker colors. Full brightness may hurt your eyes though.—————————BUILD QUALITY/AESTHETICS - 4/5Impressive for the budget. Very thin screen bezels. Almost all metal except for the bottom panel. (But the screen does flex a little bit).It’s not the thinnest or prettiest laptop, but you won’t have to worry about people judging you outside. You won’t be bringing this outside! (with a weight of 9 pounds!). All in all, this laptop might be most portable desktop I ever had.—————————KEYBOARD - 5/5Unfortunately, compromises had to be made to fit a keyboard and numpad under a 15.6” size screen. The keyboard is slightly smaller than full size (but it’s easy to get used to).The keys feel pleasantly precise and have a decent amount of travel.All complaints are automatically nullified when you turn on the laptop. YIPPE KIYAY at how sick the RGB looks, thanks to Steelseries support.—————————TOUCHPAD - 4/5It’s meh. It is a Windows Precision trackpad, so it tracks smoothly.The surface is plastic, so it’s not smooth as glass, and skin oils/sweat quickly collects on the surface. The trackpad goes back to the old days when we had physical click and right click buttons. I would have preferred if the. But then again, you’re probably using a mouse anyways, so not a con.—————————I/O - 5/5A lot better than I expected (although I’m new to gaming laptops in general). HDMI, separate audio in/audio out, USB-C, 3x USB 3, SD card slot, ethernet, mini Displayport. Charging port on the right side.I would have preferred the ports to be on the back (would help clean up the cables a but), but it’s not something you notice while gaming.—————————SPEAKERS - use headphonesThey’re pretty bad, but who cares?",0

"(Poor value, especially vs. Mac.): This laptop has the latest, greatest new release Tiger Lake lntel Core i7-1195G7 processor. And it's a great looking laptop w/great specs. Build quality seems excellent. The screen is both bright and responsive. The keyboard feels good, although it has a slightly lighter touch than I prefer.But...It runs extremely hot, both on the surface and underside of the computer. You wouldn't want to use it on your lap or sitting on your chest, which by the way, is exactly how I often use it.My MacBook Air with the M1 chip blows it away. Not sure which has better performance specs, but the MacBook Air has no fan, doesn't get hot, and takes everything you throw at it.With the MacBook Air, you may get 14 or 15 hours of battery life out of it, with this Windows-based ""state of the art"" laptop, you might be lucky to get 3-4 hours.And the MacBook Air was almost 50% cheaper than the Windows-based laptop ($899 vs. $1,700).If you're in the market for a laptop and don't need to necessarily run Windows, the choice is clear. Otherwise, other than the issues mentioned, it's a perfectly fine computer and it's quite gorgeous. Is it worth the current asking price? Not in my view. 3 star rated.",0
"(Pretty decent): Pretty good laptop for school work. However, kinda crappy of them to raise the price $100 during a pandemic lol. Bought it for $210 in December and now it’s $310? Anyway... it’s decent so far for how much it cost.",0
"(Very happy): Maybe hardcore gamers can nitpick this gaming laptop, Lord knows youtube is filled with many opinions about it (this review is for the US version...apparently corners were cut in some markets resulting in a performance hit), but after a month I can say that I think I nailed it on price vs. performance after days of research and given my sub $2000 budget. It has the requisite 16gb of RAM and the 6gb of ram on the 3060 future proofs it for a few years. (I almost fell for the 4gb 3050ti...don't do it). It is very expandable. I immediately added a 1 TB NVMe drive and found it easy to open the case and install. There is room and supplied adapter for another SSD beyond that, or you can take that spot over with a larger battery. RAM is removable. I am not a hardcore gamer so I am very happy...haven't found a game or tech demo that the 3060 can't do at least 60 fps at ultra settings. Most older games run around 120-140 fps. Build quality is not up to par with the higher end business laptops I am use to, but it is not far off. This was a very good buy at $1200.",0
it turns out that the F10 key is defected right out of the box.,0
"The computer is fast, clean and good looking",0
(Pay a few extra bucks to get a better performing laptop): For this product you get what you pay for. I'd recommend paying the extra money for a faster processor and greater memory. The lag on this laptop can be unbearable at times.,0
"the low profile bezel around the screen. Seems like a risky design, with a potentially easy break.",0
(Good product and quick delivery): Just purchased and is working as expected,0
(Love it 😍): I love my Chrome no problems at all,0
(Small for a 14 inch laptop.): This Asus Vivobook s14 with 11th gen I5 works great for everyday use and for work. I have not played any games on it but it is very snappy with great battery life.,0
(Missing): Is missing charger so can't use,0
"(10/10 value, esp. refurbished): Excellent in every regard, except outdoor brightness.",0
(I love my new Macbook!): The battery life in this laptop exceeds everything I've ever seen before. On a full charge after being on standby for a week I still have 90% battery left. In the past I've always been afraid to leave my laptop for any period of time without shutting it down. Now I never shut it down. an occupational reboot after an update or something is all it needs.,0
"(Best Gaming Laptop Choice): This is a great gaming laptop for even a greater price!Powerful GPU (RTX3070), powerful CPU (11th i7), fast drive (512nvme), great refresh rate (144Hz), I already tested it on several games without disappointment, all of them at ultra settings and without FPS drops. the MSI Center is a great app for monitoring resources and temperature.I just realized that the GPU is capped on 80W and not 130W as the MSI web page says but I still totally recommend the MSI GL66 for a great gaming experience!",0
"(Highly recommend for the price!): Absolutely perfect laptop for the price. It already has great cooling but I have the laptop on a Thermaltake RGB cooler for good measure and airflow. The predator software for thermal monitoring is excellent and you can customize how fast the fans go. I was able to install a 1TB SSD and another 1 TB NVME SSD for games. Be warned that by doing this you're potentially voiding the warranty, so make sure you're grounded and have the correct tools if you choose this route. The keyboard is okay, I ended up buying a Razer Hunstman TE so I rarely use the laptop keyboard. Overall I would not sleep on this laptop I'm very happy for buying it and I think every gamer would as well.",0
"(Enjoying this computer.): Great battery charge length – I haven't tested it such that I could report numbers, but clearly much much better than my previous 2018 Powerbook.Screen very good.The M1 processor is fast, but as expected didn't work on a few peripheral (for me) software types. However, these include iDVD and Microsoft messenger. But then again there may be upgrades available that I feel no compelling reason to pursue.",0
(Muy practica para la escuela): Mi hermana la compró y está muy contenta con ella. Buena laptop por el precio.,0
"(Very nice!): This is a really great laptop for the price, and just in general. I've had it for about a month and so far the only things I'm bothered by are the fact that the battery doesn't last as long as it's stated when not plugged in, but does charge up pretty fast. And I saw other people have said this as well, and it's true, the speakers do suck. The sound itself isn't terrible but it's just so low. Full volume is super quiet and that's annoying as a musician and tv watcher. But I'd say the pros outweigh the cons. It's a super fast machine, starts up pretty much instantly. I don't use a lot of heavy software, but I do have things like FL studio and that runs fine.The display is nice, but sometimes reds and oranges and pinks show up a little pixely. Don't know what that's about. But nothing too obvious. Maybe it's just me.The fingerprint sensor is alright. I'd say it's just a cool extra feature. Sometimes it takes awhile to read but when it does you're signed in instantly.The laptop itself doesn't make any noise and doesn't overheat either. It's very light and looks really professional and sleek. I'm kinda in love with it. It has just enough space for my needs, doesn't lag, and has a nice display. Some people were complaining about the keyboard but I like it. Feels fine to me. Even thought the laptop is light, it still feels sturdy.Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase. I hope this one lasts me awhile.",0
"(Amazing gaming laptop for the price): So far this laptop beautifully runs everything I've thrown at it, including Cyberpunk 2077 at 100+ FPS on high settings (with ray tracing off). I'm using a LG 32GP850-B monitor overclocked to 180hz and couldn't be happier. The turbo mode definitely makes a difference in the FPS but the fan is loud. I use headphones anyways so the whole family doesn't have to hear me gaming, so it doesn't bother me at all - but if you don't use headphones just be aware of the fan noise while in turbo mode.",0
"(MacBook Air M2 Review - A Student's Perspective): IntroThe base model, $1200, M2 Macbook Air is sandwiched in between the power and price of the M1 Macbook Air at $1000 and the $2000 M1 Pro Macbook Pro. All of these laptops are great, but the M2 2022 Macbook Air is an excellent option for a specific type of student.So, to see if you’re the right student for the M2 Macbook Air, we’ll have to break down 3 key features:Hardware, battery, and most importantly, processing power. Let’s dive in!So, if you look at the size and overall design of the 2022 Macbook Air, it has a refreshed design.Design & BuildThe classic sharp angles of the MacBook Airs of the past are gone, and now we’ve got this boxy design with rounded edges. It looks more like the newest Macbook Pros than it does a Macbook Air, and I kinda like that.In terms of the actual hardware specifications, this is still very clearly an Air. It’s 2.7 pounds, or 1.24 kilograms. That’s .1 pounds lighter than the last Macbook Air model.DisplayIt also has a slightly larger display at 13.6” with a resolution 2560x1664 . That display does have an extra 100 nits of brightness, now coming in at 500 knits. It honestly does make a difference when I’m doing work outside, and I think students who prefer to sit on the quad and work are going to really appreciate that improvement. Also, you can find a new 1080p webcam which is great for those zoom meetings.SpeakersAnother cool, subtle, improvement are the new speaker systems. If you look behind the backlit Magic Keyboard, you’ll actually be able to see a speaker system hidden under there. The new four-speaker sound comes with spacial audio, Dolby atmos, and wide stereo sound. This is definitely subtle, but those new speakers paired with this laptop’s lack of fans make for a really easy listening experience.Ports & AccessoriesYou’ve also got a 3.5mm headphone jack on the side and two Thunderbolt/USB-type C ports on the side and, of course, MagSafe 3. That addition of the MagSafe is another subtle but awesome thing Apple did this year. This year’s Air will come with a USB-C to mag-safe charger that will match the color of your laptop.Speaking of that Magsafe charger, the charging and battery life on the M2 are pretty great.In the box, base models of the M2 Air come with a 30W USB-C Power adapter and high-end models get a 35W power adapter. If you upgrade to a 67 W adapter, you can fast charge these laptops, and you can charge with either magsafe or USB-C.Battery LifeYou’re rated to get about 18 hours of movie playback and 15 hours of internet use on the 52.6-Watt-Hour battery in here. In my testing I found this to last multiple days of light use which students can expect the same, but when it came to battery taxing tasks like video editing you can still pull of a full day. The M2 Chip on here is definitely efficient enough for all-day battery, but if you’re going to get into intensive programs, definitely plug your laptop in. You have to remember since the 2022 Macbook Air doesn’t have fans, this laptop will already throttle intensive programs to keep cool, and it’ll automatically throttle even more if it’s attempting to save battery life.PerformanceThat takes us straight to the most important factor to determine if this is the right laptop for a student: performance. The base-model M2 chip has an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, and 16-core Neural engine. For storage, it comes with a 256gb SSD and 8gb of RAM, but you can upgrade your RAM or SSD if you want more memory. The $1499 model bumps your GPU up to a 10-core GPU and a base 512gb of storage, but otherwise has the same specs as that base model. When I render videos, edit photos or work on graphically intensive projects, you can definitely see the improvements in render times and general performance that the M2 pumps up. In 9to5Mac’s benchmarks, the M2 chip beats out the M1 with about 21% more compute power, but still falls behind the base-model M1 Pro. Now, computing power isn’t everything. The M2 still doesn’t see a huge gap in multi-core performance from the M1 and falls pretty steep behind the base M1 Pro in multi-core benchmarks. It’s important to note that 9to5Mac ran these tests on a Macbook Pro with M2, which does have some extra fans, so these benchmarks are a bit inflated compared to what a Macbook Air can do.ConclusionNow, if you’re a student, what do all these numbers mean? It means if you’re a student that has to run computationally intensive work like coding projects over and over, the M2 is going to be really valuable in squeezing in some extra debugging time. If you’re a 3D graphics, video editing, or game design person, it also means this laptop might not be for you, since the M2’s improvements in graphics don’t translate to massive gains in productivity. If you’re neither of those types of students, and you just need something for movies, research, and papers, the $200 difference between the Macbook Air 2022 and the Air 2020 is just a little extra squeeze. The average student probably won’t notice the improvements in compute power that the M2 has compared to the M1. If the convenience of Magsafe, a bit larger battery, and a slightly brighter display are worth that extra $200 for you, I’d say go for this, but Apple is still supporting the M1 chip with software updates, so if you really need to save the money, I wouldn’t be afraid to go for the 2020 Macbook Air at all.",0

"(Missing parts had to pay extra smh): I received my product today however when I opened the box the laptop was there but it was missing the adopter and power cord when I called customer service for Amazon all they suggested was I return and then reorder, I explained that this was not possible because I need this laptop for business purposes, so unable to return and file for a refund I am forced to purchase the adapter and power cord separately I paid even more money plus shipping and handling despite already paying $350 already smh this is unacceptable how did ACER EMPLOYEES not notice they put the computer in the box without the adapter or power cord how do amazon and Acer expect me to charge and use the laptop if I do not have the two most main important components!If I get this thing up and running I will I didn't my review to see how well it works or not!",0
"(Solid gaming laptop with a few issues): I got this laptop(2060 SKU) in prime day deals and used it for 2 weeks now. Honestly speaking this device does have its own issues but most of them can be solved permanently or temporarily with fixes and workarounds. If you spend the time and tweak/tune it, its well worth the effort.Pros:- Very good and stable performance. 6 hours of gaming with no visible fps degradation. You need to put in another stick for dual channel though.- Chassis quality and hinges. It gives a premium feel overall. Very dense materials cause it to be much heavier than it looks. Solid and compact.- Nice panel, most units come with an AUO that has many calibration files over internet that u can apply but mine came with a similar quality LG panel. Unfortunately isnt as colour accurate out of the box. Still looks gorgeous in games, however.- Good keyboard if you can live with the gamer-y looks.Cons:- Asus bloatware. It hijacks your Windows Powerplan and causes kb rgb issues in some modes.- Some coil whine and backlight bleeding. But this is up to your luck and can happen with any other laptop as well.Other thoughts:- 2060 sku is much cooler than 2070. Mine hovers around mid/low 70s for both processors on average while running Witcher 3. Maybe low 80s on cpu for more intense games like BF 5. But many people complain about thermals in 704gw.- Myasus app allows you to change the battery charging profile. This can help with yor battery lifespan. Only useful software that comes with the laptop.- Amazon promotion isnt valid if you're not a US resident. Kind of a bummer but no big deal.Overall I'm happy with its performance. Runs cool enough so my Ocd self doesn't have to worry.",0
"(Wonderful product and very easy to use.): I am really happy with the chromebook, it was given as a gift to me by my loved one very close to me.It is a wonderful product.Thank youAB",0
(Can’t be charged after one year!): My chrome book can’t be charged after one year. I thought it was the battery problem. So I bought a new battery but it didn’t work. It should be the problem of the connection. Unfortunately the warranty is expired after one year. Now my chrome book is just a trash.,0
The price is definitely the selling point of this laptop along with the lightweight portability.,0

"(Great for students): This chromebook exceeded my expectations. Its everything I was looking for. I bought it for my out of state vacation so I could do my homework online. Its quick, extremely portable, and the battery life is amazing! I get 10 hrs out of it every charge. If you're expecting this to be able to play games you're asking too much. Light web browsing and working on documents/papers are what this thing was made for. Cant beat the price either.",0

(ONLY WIFi. Cannot be hard wired): Most disappointed in Asus. Some people like to have R 45. Option. No R45 Jack.Volume is soft.,0
"(Upgraded to this Asus UX330UA-AH55 from an Asus UX305F.): I had a few years old Asus UX305F (Core M processor) that I was happy with until it got a large glass of water down the keyboard. I looked at others but the lightweight Asus still fit my needs best. Almost identical except that the speakers on the new model are much louder and it has the backlit keyboard. Other than that it still has the combo page/line keys which require you to use two hands to hit the function key to activate the page function - I'd prefer separate keys but you get used to it. The fan is very quite, barely noticeable when it does come on. The 8th gen Core I5 is zippier than the core M processor in my old one and it certainly has enough power for all of the average user's needs.",0
"(Not impressed , the damn thing quit working): Used for personal use , well , I wanted to and like I said , the damn thing quit working , won't power on or anything , not happy at all",0
(Great price): Very easy to set up. Great visuals and love the fairly large screen size. Perfect for basic use and a great price.,0
"(Great laptop for basic use): Bought this for my 14year old daughter. It doesn’t have a lot of memory so downloading is limited but for basic homework stuff and watching movies and what-not, it’s worth the money.",0
"(Not as advertised 1366x768): Screen resolution is 1366x768, not the advertised 1920x1080Battery seems sketchy too",0
(Five Stars): Great computer I'm currently using it for DJing and music production and it hasn't failed me yet.,0
"(One week with this laptop, 3 crashes and net framework not working): when i received the laptop it was packaged brand new. i've only had this laptop for a week now and it crashed the very next day i got it. thought maybe i was just on too many windows but i literally only had chrome up and league of legends downloading. i have downloaded steam but the games won't launch. this laptop net framework had errors so i could download directx to play games. now the keyboard back light is not working. everytime i reset the computer i get the asus system program screen. the performance of this laptop is terrible. this shouldnt even be 900. i feel like this is a 400 laptop. i did not think i would have this much issues already. planning to return this",0
(It is okay for browsing the web or watching a video or two): Grab something with more RAM or even better a Chromebook,0
"(Plagued by power problems and repairs): While this laptop does have a nice design and decent screen with 144hz refresh rate, my experience with this laptop has been plagued with power issues that required my computer to go back to Acer for now a 2nd time for the same exact issue. On top of that, Acer customer support is not easy to access or particularly helpful until you get higher level managers involved. For a laptop that costs such a premium price, I would expect a much higher quality product and that simply has not been the case. Very disappointed in Acer this time around.",0
(Nice lightweight lap top.): Excellent school laptop.,0
(Three Stars): It's probably a 5. First lap top.,0
"(Exactly what I expected, but needs more RAM): First off, I probably am not the most qualified to be reviewing this product, because my last laptop was a 3rd gen Thinkpad Yoga 11e that I saved from the graveyard after my sister left it in the rain (It's a long story, GRIN.)When I first received the product, the first thing I noticed was that the Lenovo factory sticker that ""seals"" the box was still intact, and so was the sticker on the plastic bag that the laptop was in. So to the best of my knowledge, even though this is sold and shipped by a 3rd party seller, it DOES appear to be a NEW genuine part that has NOT been tampered with. (I bring this up because I remember seeing another review where they accused the seller of selling a fraudulent/used product.)After unboxing, my first thought was ""Dang, this thing is big."" But this is NOT a fault of the product. I was just used to an 11"" notebook, not a 15"" work machine. For its size, this laptop is slim, light, and stylish. My only complaint about the product's appearance is that the 'lid' is a fingerprint magnet, easily getting smudged. The included charger is a Type-C 65w charger, so to those who LOVE USB-C, this is definitely a plus. Personally, I don't like the small connector for a laptop. I definitely prefer the older style Lenovo plug.After I got the laptop set up, I was surprised at the screen in particular. This thing looks GREAT. It almost looks better than my 29"" ultrawide that my main PC runs on. The software is snappy, and the only bloatware I found was McAfee. PLEASE, Lenovo, stop using this! McAfee is a HORRIBLE antivirus that eats CPU for breakfast, lunch AND dinner. Outside of that, there is no major bloat, so you're getting VERY close to a vanilla Windows experience.The hardware is a good spec: Ryzen 7 3700u, Vega 10 integrated graphics, 8gb of RAM, 256gb SSD. But let's stop on the RAM for a minute. 2gb of your RAM is dedicated to your graphics. This means that you're limited to 6gb for the OS. Windows will use 3, so you're pretty much out of luck if you use any software that uses a lot of RAM (Chrome, anyone?) Thankfully, there is a second RAM slot available, and it's reasonably easy to access. (Lenovo is also reasonable as far as warranty is concerned) While I'm on the subject, there is also a spare 2.5"" hard drive bay inside the machine, so if you need more storage there's an upgrade path there as well.The keyboard is nothing to write home about, but I find it comfortable to work with, and I can type very close to full speed with minimal errors. It's tactile, quiet, and spacious; something my old Yoga 11e couldn't provide.This is getting long, so I'll summarize. This laptop is everything you would expect out of a $600 ThinkPad. It will get anything done that you need it to, as long as you upgrade the RAM. I would recommend.",0
(Educational and fun device.): My granddaughter uses it for school work and for entertainment at home.,0
"(Very portable): I am very happy with this item., thanks",0
(El producto llegó en excelente condiciones): La batería dura mucho,0
(Good bang for the buck): Purchased the laptop for a wonderful young lady and she’s enjoying it immensely,0
"(Overall I've been disappointed with this purchase): The fan is not working now, and of course warranty and support expired in June. No computer I've owned has had a problem like that so soon. Overall I've been disappointed with this computer. It uses more power than most laptops. I travel and live off-grid most of the time. I attempted to get a 12v charge cord so i wouldn't need to run it through my inverter but wasn't able to find one. So that was my first disappointment.It didn't have the hard drive storage I thought it was going to have. I do digital art, photography and videos so this was my second disappointment. I looked at so many laptops before I bought I guess I just didn't remember which one had what features. I also was limited to laptops where I could make monthly payments.I probably shouldn't have asked my grandson who's a gamer for advice in selecting the right computer for me. Because of my art/video needs I thought it would be a good choice. Not so much so.Now I'm having to figure out how to find and replace the fans.",0
"(An amazing machine, and great quality from this company.): I was taking a risk, as I saw in one answer I saw there was a fingerprint reader. In fact, there IS a fingerprint reader for windows hello.The machine was exactly as desribed, brand new with factory sealed parts and plastic.TOUCHSCREEN 1920x1080!

"(Good. Windows 11 not 10.): Great laptop, but comes with Windows 11 not W10 as advertised. Windows 11 has color banding issues, so be aware of that. It's not the laptop; it's W11.I'm SOL with color banding until Microsoft releases a fix, or I can find a way to downgrade to 10.",0
(Laptop): I like that its light and good on battery,0
(Very good laptop for gaming and streaming(fortnite/r6 siege with streaming software ...): Very good laptop for gaming and streaming(fortnite/r6 siege with streaming software running at the same time) but like every other gaming laptops it gets HOT that's my only complaint(I know that they're all like that but it would be fun not to have to repaste the damn cpu when you get it!). Get a good cooling pad and try to undervolt cpu and other little tweeting and you ready to go(gpu overclock)!,0
(PIECE OF JUNK!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$.): PIECE OF JUNK!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$. It bears repeating. I've had this overpriced paperweight for less than 5 months. I don't use it very often and tonight went to turn it on and it displayed a message that the Chrome OS is not working. I spent roughly hour researching and troubleshooting on the Goggle 'help' site and found out that basically there's no known fix if after attempting to download and install a new copy of the OS doesn't work.,0
(Good Value): Item matched the description.,0
"(Great porduct): Great computer fro small tasks, needed one for my kid since school items needed done on the computer now.",0
"Playing games, the graphics processor pretty much screams.",0
(Really worth it!!! JUST BUY IT!!!!): Honestly I was scared of getting stuff from Amazon especially when it comes to apple products but ACTUALLY it came in really nice. The box didn’t came damaged or lost/stolen (which is my biggest fear lol) but yeah REALLY LOVE IT!!!!!,0
"(I'm used to a more sharp looking screen with better graphics on the games I play): First time purchasing an Asus laptop. I'm used to a more sharp looking screen with better graphics on the games I play. Battery life isn't that great; only 3 hours compared to other laptops I've previously owned.The laptop runs cool; never overheats. I thought having a dual fan would be noisy, boy was I wrong! The speakers are one of the best features on this laptop by far. It's almost comparable to a Bose feel where the sound surrounds the room. There's only one major concern with this laptop and I'm sure it's just a cosmetic defect on the manufactures end. I can't get over a small raised bump on the touch pad itself. I've tried to scratch it down to no avail. It's incredibly difficult to ignore.This issue can be avoided with purchasing a mouse on the side. The laptop is very light and has a nice appeal to it. I feel for the price point you're getting a decent value. If you spend a bit more you can have a far better version of this laptop.Edit: Unfortunately I'm starting to hear the fans and the laptop itself getting hotter as weeks go by. I'm unsure why this is happening. The keys are even hot to the touch; this was never an issue before. :( I've taken off a star..",0
(Good product): Good quality,0
The screen quality is pretty good,0
"(HELP!): My grandson was very happy with this item....until the dog got tangled up in the charging cord, knocked the computer to the floor and cracked the screen. Any ideas on replacing screen? FYI, I did not purchase the insurance. Thanks for any suggestions you may have.",0
(Good buy.): We love it. It works great.,0
(Cannot connect to internet from basement.): This chrome book cannot connect to the internet from my basement. My HP laptop does fine. Disappointed by this. Cannot really comment on anything else since I have not used that much because of this lack of connection power.,0
(Its good.): Its a nice computer for the simple person. It doesnt allow netflix or Hulu streaming but overall it's good.,0
"(Acer Aspire E15 laptop): Would give it 5 stars except that right mouse button acts like left button. Been on phone with tech and not completely fixed yet. When it is working as it should will give it 5 stars. Hope it is not a hardware issue.Found out the problem. Wasn't hardware, but the ""tap right corner of touchpad for right button"" was turned off. So I am extremely happy with this computer and will give it 5 stars. It is fast.",0
(Great product!): Very happy with the product,0
"(The best value thin light windows laptop.): So good I just bought another one. Fast, light, bright sharp screen, SSD makes boot up just a few seconds. Thin and great battery life averaging 8-10 hours of use between charges. That's about once every 3-4 days of casual use for me. The only improvement I can think of is to make the keys a little more curved instead of flat. But other than that, it's a perfect laptop. Does not come with a huge amount of bloatware that needs to be removed. The speakers are not too bad either.The Dell XPS 13 may be better but at $1300 compared to this one at $750, this one is a much better value.",0
(Very Nice): For the cost this computer is just what I was looking for in speed in quality of HP. Delivered on time in perfect condition and very fast boot up and navigation,0
"(Great): I bought this to start writing novels on. I have never used a Chromebook before, so I was kind of disappointed that I couldn't use Word, and I can't download a lot of what a regular computer will let you do, but I quickly got over that. Google Docs works just as good, and I recently got an update that added Google Play. The font is quite small on the screen, though. But a plus side is it has its own virus protection. It is also not as big as a regular laptop. It is the perfect size for me. All in all, I love it and I am glad I ran across this.",0
(crap): crap,0
"(Feels kind of basic): No so impressed, I mean by the value and in comparison with other laptops in the market I thought the performance was going to be stunning but is more average. Design is very basic, the hinges of the screen feel a little flimsy. Screen quality looks fine, try with a uhd display video and details are really good. Overall it feels like is halfway to a gaming machine that will last long.",0
"(Just what I needed, for the right price.): I was skeptical, for the price for the touch screen to be as responsive as it is, I use the Chromebook for digital art with a collection of s-pen stylus . All work perfectly, the only issue i have had is learning that chrome os is quite different from Android. But I believe that it is very well comparable.",0
(ASUS is not the brand for you): I purchased this computer one year and 1 month ago and the motherboard failed just outside of the factory warranty period. ASUS refused to make an exception even though it was 1 month outside of warranty and quoted $1500 to repair the laptop which is the price of an entirely new one. Obscene! Later that week I saw someone else's ASUS laptop hard drive fail which proves my point. ASUS computers are not built to last. Buyers beware. Shop an entirely different brand.,0
"(Do not buy this!): I have had excellent luck with other Asus products but this one is a thorn in my side! It flat out doesn't work, I've had to reset it several times since I purchased it in January. Finally just gave up and spent the extra money for a good HP with a hard drive. In fact, I am attempting to factory reset this piece of crap and hope someone will buy it resale. By the way, I have never ever written such a negative review on any other consumer product. I used to rave over Asus products, maybe I just got a lemon but this machine is a total headache!!!!",0
"(Great battery life, plenty fast, awful finger print reader): Battery life: I've owned this laptop for almost a year now and regularly get 8 hours of battery life according to the windows battery usage statistics. I usually browse the web, watch Netflix and game now and then.Preinstalled software: This machine came with a bunch of pre-installed software, which I immediately wiped after setting up windows using the windows refresh tool. I'd highly recommend this as you don't need *any* of the apps Acer has pre-installed on this laptop.Speed: No problem here. This thing is more than fast enough for its intended use: youtube, facebook, netflix, gmail, etc etc. I've never had issues with RAM, even with quite a few chrome tabs open, and I've never had to wait very long for the machine to boot or resume from sleep.Build quality: This thing is feels rock solid. I feel confident picking it up by the corner of the base, and frequently carry it around with 1 hand when I need to walk around with it.Fingerprint sensor: The fingerprint sensor is god awful. It reads my finger about 1 in every 10 tries, which is rare enough that windows always makes me enter my PIN when I try to use it to login. Sometimes, I can get my finger in just the right position and it unlocks instantly, but it's super rare. I don't understand how my phone from 5 years ago could be so much better.Everything Else: I really have no other complaints about this laptop. Everything works just fine and stays out of your way so you can just use the laptop.",0
"(Great speeds, so lightweight, efficient): Huge upgrade from my old Lenovo IdeaPad. Much faster for everything, and it barely weighs anything. Very convenient, looks slick, and I actually enjoy using my laptop again instead of getting frustrated with it.Some reviews online mentioned issues with the bottom of it being too thin and the mouse clicking when you're just holding the laptop - I've had it for 3 months now and that hasn't happened even once. I carry it around from living room to home office pretty often too. No issues with that.The only issue I've had is with using Citrix Workspace with dual monitors - I have a docking station and 2 work monitors hooked up to the laptop, and they work great with no issues most of the time. Using Citrix to remote in, only 1 monitor works; the other 2 are always frozen.",0

(Great computer for the price): This laptop is a good quality for the price and the picture is good. The sound is not as good as a high end laptop but most people use headphones anyways. I really like that the keys have a grip type coding on them. My work laptop that is four times the price does not have this and I wish it did.,0

"(Great buy): I ordered and tried out 6 different laptops before finally settling on this one. Runs fast and has a long battery life. It didn't shatter when my dog knocked it off of the bed and jumped down on it either, so that's a plus. It doesn't have a touch screen or the tablet mode where you can bend the screen all the way around, but I think that's kinda dumb anyway so I don't care. This little guy is pretty good all around. 10/10 would recommend",0

Amazing performance laptop with good looks.,0
"(Not impressed - slower than most chromebooks): I was swayed with the bigger screen and the HDMI port; but have found it to be noticeably slower than previous HP Chromebook purchases. I had 3 HPs but wanted to try something different. If this was my very first one, I would be impressed; but I also see that the resolution is wanting compared to my old one, which is still on the floor in front of me; but it kept losing the cursor and I finally bought this one.",0
"(Unsolvable bluescreen issue on this gaming laptop & damaged item): I first received the laptop back in Oct 2021 but did not open to check as I trust Amazon for all of their products based on all of my previous experiences. Not until recent days, did I decide to open the box and give it a try Initially, everything was fine, then I noticed a broken part on the back of the laptop. I couldn't believe it. I don't know if this is Lenovo's problem or Amazon's problem. And things only got worse from here. Within the first 30 mins of using this laptop, the constant bluescreen told me that an ""unknown problem has occurred. We need to gather some information then you may restart your laptop"". When I say constant, I mean every 5 mins and no, I did not open a crazy amount of software or anything, it was only youtube watching (3 - 4 tabs on chrome) while downloading Genshin Impact from the official website.After some research online (i should have done this before purchasing), it appears that this is a faulty issue on this laptop and is causing many users unusable. And this problem is unsolvable (even after contacting Lenovo support). So basically I spend 1k on a laptop with a serious flaw.I am returning this right now and will update my experience here regarding the return status.My personal suggestion, stay away from this laptop. Find one that doesn't give you an unsolvable bluescreen gaming laptop.",0

(Slow as Molasses!): This notebook is sooooo slow to load web pages -- it is virtually worthless! What a waste of money. I do not understand all the positive reviews. Shame on amazon for recommending it!!! Junk...,0
"(Good computer partially defeated by bad connectivity): Would be a perfect package of weight, flexibility, functionality and sturdiness were it not for a crucial feature that doesn’t work properly: its Wi-Fi is, sadly, worthless. And since a Chromebook is extremely dependent on being well connected, this can be pretty irritating: Document revisions are halted intermittently, things freeze, get lost…So my advice: get something that covers the basics competently.",0
"(Pretty solid product): First of all, great product considering the price. The machine is fast and all the games i've tried ran without any problem. I like the design and the keyboard is well lit and comfortable, also the num pad is a plus. Pretty decent screen. It runs hot, but hey, it's a gaming laptop. I would recommend buying a cooling pad.The only thing i didn't like was the touch pad. It feels kinda clunky to me. I gave it 4 stars because the network wifi adapter is not working properly (currently in contact with support in order to find a solution).",0
"(Just the right size for me): I have used this laptop as my main computer for several months. It was convenient to carry to the medical facilities, where I spent most of my time with my aged Mom for 3 months. I use it mostly plugged in, so really haven't tested the battery life. It came with a small crack in the left side frame, which has gradually become more prominent. I need to glue that down. Not sure it has anything to do with this laptop, but typing, etc. is a real learning curb for me, especially on Facebook posts. The cursor seems to fly away sometimes. Not sure if it's all laptops, but Microsoft frequently prevents Firefox from accessing their graphics hardware and the FB feed stalls and the next 3 post photos or images disappear from the screen. But, I am a HP fan and wouldn't trade this laptop for any other. It's also just the right size for my needs. I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm sure these grievances have more to do with Microsoft and my own learning curb.",0
"(Love the MSI Software, Needs More Durable Hardware): This is the first gaming/ high tech laptop I have ever owned. Previously I had only ever used Toshiba laptops with 4-6 GB of RAM and not great graphics cards. I finally decided to upgrade because I needed something more powerful to run Adobe Lightroom without crippling lag and freezing screens. The bonus ability to use VR is also a perk I wasn't going to turn down either. I can't really rate the ""Value for Money"" since I have not previously spent this kind of money on a laptop, and it was a Black Friday deal so who knows exactly what the mark down was, but for ~$2000 including a square trade 4 year protection plan I would make the purchase again.So far the MSI Leopard has been amazing. I was surprised and impressed with the size, weight and build. The keyboard is solid, no give or flexibility to the keys, and I get to pick the colors for the LED's! The screen has strong hinges and the power chord is a monster. The only thing I wish was different was the location of the FN key. It's way over by the left CTRL while the volume and brightness keys are overlayed on the arrow keys so my average sized hand isn't long enough to reach FN and the adjustment keys.*Update* after just under 2 years the case is being held together with duct tape, epoxy, binder clips and thin wood braces because of various cracks in the bottom and sides of the laptop. The laptop managed to go a year and a half with no physical damage but the past 4 months more and more cracks have been appearing despite attempts to reinforce weak areas. More recently the plastic by the right hinge snapped and flew everywhere, now whenever the screen is lifted up or put down I hear a peeling sound and am trying to find a way to hold the screen frame together without getting it stuck open or closed. The laptop has been used almost daily but has never been dropped or handled roughly, I can only surmise the damage is due to the laptop running hot. Rather disappointed that my 8 year old Toshiba managed to outlast my (almost) 2 year old MSI in structural integrity. Have to decide now how much money I want to sink into trying to repair the case for an otherwise perfectly working laptop, or try another brand as I read case cracks and hinges breaking after frequent use is not an uncommon problem with MSI...",0

"(Great Laptop for the Price): I am not a gamer at all, so I have no idea how it is as a gaming machine. However, I will tell you the speakers are not audible, so I suspect it will hamper any joy if you're a gamer. I had to replace my Sony Vaio laptop just 14 months after purchasing and right out of warranty the motherboard gave out. I will never again pay top dollar for a computer. This computer is perfectly suitable for online teaching, what I do, and it's very easy to set up. I was concerned about moving from I7 to I3, but it's just as fast as my I7, 16 GB of Ram. This is a very nice machine and is worth the money! The other advantage is that ASUS has a chat function and the reps are very responsive.",0
"(Good product for the price): Purchased this for my 9 year old to complete some schoolwork with. Very pleased! Smaller size allows it to be more “kid friendly”, very lightweight and durable. Love the ability to fold over and use as a tablet.",0
"(Not terrible): The machine overall isn't that bad. It can handle casual gaming, it is fast and seems cool enough. Battery is meh, and the fan is a little annoying as it is a high pitch. To be honest I came here to mention how this was a bit of a let down compared to my ASUS vivobook that I'm replacing, as I've gotten back into gaming. The overall system is just not as good, but if you need a cheap laptop with a GPU this is worth the money.",0
(Battery is always dead): Battery doesn’t hold a charge .,0
The screen looks super nice with brilliant color.,0
"(80 degrees temp is not too hot, please stop spreading this garbage): I'm not reviewing this product, I'm just pointing something out that seems to not be well understood given some of these negative reviews.The thermal throttling point for a desktop class NVIDIA GPU, like this 1060 6Gb, is 84 degrees. If you took the reference cooler version of this GPU in a desktop, you would find yourself continuously hovering near this temperature without an altermarket cooler (this includes the non-reference cooler designs by ASUS, Gigabyte, etc) in a normal DESKTOP case.That being said, although 84 degrees Celsius is hot and borderline uncomfortable on your lap, IT IS perfectly normal. You're talking about a laptop with a desktop class GPU stuffed into a tiny case with a screen and keyboard. The reviews complaining about temperature are actually somewhat ignorant and do not have realistic expectations given the power of this laptop. My EVGA 1080 ti is in a min-itx case with excellent cooling, and still hovers just under 79 degrees at times under load with a moderate overclock. Now consider the design requirements of a laptop. That being said, is it unsafe? No. Uncomfortable? Sure. But technically it's not overheating, and the cards are designed to throttle down performance at 84 degrees to PREVENT over heating.Sure, it's not optimal to run at that temp for long periods of time. But it is completely unrealistic to think you're not going to occasionally experience thermal throttling in such a tiny enclosure. If you don't like it, perhaps you need to build a desktop and stop watching YouTube builders misleading you into thinking 84 degrees is overheating. It's not overheating, it's the THROTTLING POINT where the cards decrease their clock rate in order to PREVENT overheating.",0

My previous computer had a very small computer and was very comfortable for me. This keyboard is a little more spread out so it may be more comfortable for a man’s hands.Anyway, does what I need it to do.",0

"(Great Value): Love this thing! I got it as a backup for streaming from my gaming system, and to play some older titles on-board. Some find the screen a little dim, I don't notice that. It's only got a GTX1650, so you're not looking at Anthem at Ultra settings with this, though it'll run everything out at the time of this writing. This is for casual gaming, after all. If your looking to squeeze out high FPS at 4k you're not going anywhere near this for sure. That isn't a knock--at this price point this laptop is a screaming deal.The i5 is great, and snappy in daily use. The placement of the various ports is a little goofy (hence deducting a star), but no tech is perfect. I run this with 16gb of RAM and I added a 1tb hard drive, which when added to the overall price still makes this a very good deal.And it isn't listed, but this does have Bluetooth.",0

I called the Amazon repair center and was told it was no longer under warranty. Was transferred several times. Was sent finally to Acer service. They told me since it may be a fire issue I would have to send it back for repair and be without a laptop for 5 to 10 business days. I do not have other options. I am running two households due to the fact that my Mother in law is in Memory care. They said they would send me a mailing label.

(Very nice): I love everything about it,0
"(Very disappointing. Do not buy this laptop!!!): The UX550VE is a very disappointing entry to the Zenbook lineup in my opinion. Seriously, do not buy this laptop! Let me explain:I am an IT professional and long-time Asus customer, both for laptops and motherboards. I have used a Zenbook UX31A as my primary ultrabook for about six years since I bought it at its release. It has been an exceptional machine - even in its old age (just had to replace the charging port, but now it's my Linux portable). Looking back, I am surprised to have used the same laptop for so long, and that should speak to how well built of a machine it is. So of course when I needed a new laptop, I quickly decided on another Zenbook.When I was shopping for laptops, I really *really* wanted the UX550VD. I contacted Asus many times when it would be released in the US, but of course they could never tell me. Eventually the old Zenbook went out of commission for a while, so I had to upgrade and settled on the UX550VE. Don't get me wrong, the specs on this machine at nothing to sneeze at and there are some good aspects to it. However, the flaws are so glaring that they ruin the entire user experience and so those are all I will be discussing here.First of all, the charging port on my particular unit super shoddy. Really janky af. It's not lined up with the case, so I feel like I am going to break it every time I insert the charger. It does work, but this should not have passed QC. See attached photo. The rest of the physical build is just okay; this is still a pretty big and fairly hefty machine - nothing to write home about.Second, the fingerprint scanner is pretty nice to have, but why in the world is it ON THE TOUCHPAD!? Asus, I'd actually really like an answer to this question. Having the fingerprint reader on the touchpad renders the entire right corner of the touchpad UNUSABLE as a touchpad. Are you telling me the fingerprint scanner cannot be placed to the right of the touchpad on all this empty space below the keyboard? Lenovo and other brands have figured this out already. I should have considered this when purchasing the laptop, but this is just really, really stupid design - unless I'm missing something. Even the part of the touchpad above and to the right of the fingerprint scanner does not actually work - it's just cosmetic. I'll be waiting for an explanation to this design choice, Asus.Speaking of poor design choices, what's with the lack of ventilation on this thing? There really is not any ventilation except for the hinge that I can see. You guys cram an i7 and 1070 in here and expect a hinge to cool it all when I'm gaming? Let me tell you from experience, that is not happening. Even when playing lightweight 2D games, the fan in this machine becomes annoyingly loud and is still inadequate to cool the hardware inside (yes, with proper atmosphere on a table). That means the keyboard and palm rests become uncomfortably warm to the touch, and the underside of this machine gets very *very* hot.Oh, did I mention it sometimes makes these weird electrical noises? if the CPU is being heavily utilized, it kind of sounds like high-pitched whine, but it's intermittent. I don't know what it is exactly, but I am an A+ certified PC technician and I know a computer is not supposed to sound like that.On a software note, out of the box I receive this popup very often: ""There is no email program associated to perform the requested action. Please install an email program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel."" I've already removed all the bloatware, and this is coming from dllhost/COM Surrogate. Mail app is already set to my default; other default apps don't work. I'm just going to wipe it and do a fresh install of Windows 10 Pro (which I also would have liked to see included on this model) so this isn't a big deal to me, but for a standard consumer that is not a PC technician this could be very annoying. It's sloppy and cheap that I received an error message moments after powering on the computer for the first time, and it continues to pop up randomly ever now and then.I could go on but I think that's enough for this review. My point is that I have been very happy with Asus for a long time, but this laptop feels incredibly cheap and not at all worth the price tag or the ""Pro"" moniker. I am suffering severe buyers remorse and probably will not be purchasing any Asus products in the future. I'm seeing way too much competition from other brand that offer better products. I do not recommend this laptop to anybody, and in fact I suggest you avoid it at all costs.",0
"(All 3 USB 3.0 ports finicky, borderline unusable unless laptop is on flat surface- Any solutions?): One month after purchase, all 3 standard USB 3.0 ports started having issues. Devices plugged into the ports will disconnect unless the cord was oriented properly and precisely (possibly a lose connection?). I've tried disabling USB selective settings, checking the drivers, and even physically trying to tighten the USB ports by pulling the USB port clamps up with a screwdriver. None of it seemed to have an effect.The problem mostly has an effect on the laptop's portability as moving it about causes the USB devices to disconnect and reconnect. On a flat surface like a desk, this problem is pretty much solved, but devices such as my Oculus Rift S VR headset seem to simply not work as Windows 10 ""doesn't recognize this USB device."" Hoping to avoid returning it, so if anyone has experienced this please let me know and how you dealt with the problem. Thank you.",0

(I Like it.): Ok so I am not a big computer person. I use one every day all day but I am not the person to throw specifications at you. I have a MacBook Pro (several years old) that I use when I need mobility and I like it but it was time for a new laptop. I like to change them out before any issues arise and I loose every thing. This dell has a nice feel to it and I like the feel of the keys. The screen is crisp and clear but dose have some bleeding around the edges. The speed is superior to what I was using. I do a lot of CAD design work related to 3d printing and this can be too much for some computers but this dell handles it just fine. I find the battery life is about what I would expect. It fluctuates with what I am doing but I can count on a good solid 4 hours before I need to charge it. I wish the screen was bigger but that has to do with my budget (and eyes) not the computer. My MacBook Pro was hot on the legs after about 20 minutes and this one is the same but that is to be expected when you think of all that is going on in there. I try to not use any lap top on my lap for several reasons. First off It can't be good all of that electrical field held up to you're body. Second heat kills things. You're legs are a great insulator to hold in that heat and just cook things. I like this Dell lap top and I can recommend it based on my needs. If the specs match you're needs then I think you will like it too.5 STARS,0

I have an Oculus Quest and use the link to this machine and has had no issues up to this point. I would recommend this laptop for someone who doesn't have the space for a full gaming PC but is looking for some great performance.,0
Integrating NFC technology into the touch screen so users can quickly transfer data or make payments,1
"(great macbook alternative, but with some minor problems): Pros:- great build quality, metal and plastic combined- UHD screen and its colors are amazing, responsive touchscreen and very useful- lightweight, you can carry it almost everywhere- relatively future proof with powerful specs- really good back lit keyboard for typing, it takes a day or two to get used to it- speakers are good compared to other laptops at this price- touchpad allows multiple gestures- fast fingerprint sensorCons:- My screen came with some minor light bleeding. I don't really mind, but it's unacceptable at this price- Windows 10 Home came with a lot of bloatware. I would suggest fresh Windows install- Battery lasts about 5-6 hours of browsing (Youtube, etc.) at Chrome with brightness dimed at 30%- You can hear the CPU fan sometimes due to the fact that laptop heats up very easily when charging (even in idle), really annoying for a laptop at this price- Boot time is awful, it takes about 10-15 seconds to open compared to my old laptop with SATA SSD at 8-9 seconds. Dell logo appears twice at boot",0
(Awesome laptop): Best laptop I've bought. Yea the fans are a little noisy but other then that it's perfect.,0
"(Good product (after 1 year)): It is a nice, neat, light, and relatively high-performance laptop. I do my student works like using MATLAB, Solidworks, etc. as well as playing some not graphically heavy video games. Its light, compact and the battery life is fair enough. After a while I stopped suing the touch screen as a second monitor, since I bought an actual one. But overall its a good one :)",0
(Do not waste your money this is a piece of crap and high way robbery): Not functional,0
"(Regret): I'm not impressed with this machine, especially at the price it's listed. I paid far less than this for my HP Spectre and it's a higher quality machine. Functionally everything works but it's like comparing a Lamborghini to a Datsun. Both ""work"" but which would you rather use? The bezel and body on my HP are far superior. They are prettier and feel better to use. This Dell doesn't feel much different than my acer chromebook. It doesn't perform any better than the chromebook either.Overall it works but doesn't convey any features to me that deserve the price and that's important to me. I dislike unnecessarily overpriced products.",0

The touchpad is very fussy about where you press it to get a left click or a right-click.,0
(Great computer and fast delivery!): The keyboard and power cord are much improved from the older MacAir versions. Excellent device!,0
"(Very difficult to operate): No touch screen even though it says touch screen, Would never buy another chromebook",0
(Display broken upon arrival. Black screen of nothing.): Pushed the power button for the first time and was greeted with pretty keyboard lights and a black screen. Laptop display never powered up. Sending back for a refund. Would not recommend as it is either not packaged properly or having some kind of factory hardware issues.,0
(Good Product): So far this computer works great ... i am happy with my purchase,0
(Its a pretty good laptop so far): Its a pretty good laptop so far. Reloading (to get rid of the Bloat...) seems to take a really long time but that is windows and not a hit on the laptop. So far its nice for the price....and the DVD...its real not fake....so who ever said that was full of it.,0
"(Not a good a quality): The laptop battery does not last, not even 75% as stated, came with lots of scratches and dents, it works, but for that money, I could had bought a new one",0
"(Beautiful): I love me some apple products! Absoutely beautiful gold. It’s brand new, sealed. Came very quick and in perfect condition. Set up is quick, the Touch ID is super fast. My iPad Pro has the M1 and let’s just say, it’s a game changer. Highly recommend getting this.",0

It is a decent low budget laptop BUT first thing you should do is find another version of Windows 11 and install it. The reason is some of these were sent out with windows that was not the final version and causes all kinds of problems(not start menu, black screen, apps not working right). You can find you activation number after you install a new version of windows by opening up a command prompt with admin right and type: wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey and hit enter. Copy down you activation number and activate your new windows 11. If you have no start menu and cant open a command prompt hit: ctrl+alt+delet and then click Task manager, from the File menu click: Run new task, then type: cmd, and click the box that says: Create this task with administrative privileges. Then type or paste : wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey and then click enter, this will give you your activation number. DO NOT 'reset' this PC as it will reinstall the bad version of windows as well.

I am able to game Battlefield 214 of it with medium/low settings with some lag but its playable.The ram is upgradable which is nice. You cant have a total of 20gb of RAM. DD4 2400.The processor only 2 cores but they do max at 4ghz and are Intel i3 which is a nice upgrade from the intel atom I had but 4 cores would be better.This has an actual hardrive which is a plus to the 64gb flash drive my Aspire 1 had.The battery last about 2 hours which I wish was longer.The display is 1080p but it doenst seem as good as my aspire 1 for some reason even after updating the driver. Maybe more ram will help.I paid $150 for my Aspire 1 and $280 for the Aspire 5, nearly twice and Id say its not really worth the price.Not sure if Ill keep it but I could much more right now.",0

So this is a great deal!This is A+ grade for that price.Heres a top tier gaming computer for a budget price. I actually bought 2 of them both with the 4 year insurance each.If I want to i can later add a 2 tb 2.5 hdd or ssd and 2x32gb Ram cards these babys will be golden computers for at least 5 years and i can have them to use now when i need them most.Ps. I ended ip putting 1tb ssd in them. That was all i needed. Way more power than expected!You wont find a better deal.

The hd lossless sound is amazing, 144hz screen is fast amd responsive, aliminum lid is a nice touch, the per key programable rgb keyboard lighting and effects are rediculously cool and this super specially desighned and patented heat pipe system is the thing i love the most on this rig!The push keys near the power key to vent heat and turn both fans to full and another to switch between rgb key profiles on the built in steel key series is golden level luxury on a gaming laptop!

"(This product is garbage.): Just for example, right now I'm trying to search for recipes by googling what I'd like. Each link I click on of course has many videos and ads which is an annoying thing about the internet these days regardless. But on this machine, it is unmanageable. It takes so long for the sites to load and then you can't scroll easily, keeps getting hung up. So I must do stuff like this on my phone instead. It's useless for even this simple function.For another thing. I'm trying to stream a movie. If you rewind or pause or do anything like that, it freezes, buffers forever. Even if you leave it alone and just let it play, it skips every few minutes.One last thing. My email is with yahoo. I know it's an old provider, but I don't want to change it- I've had it for years. The OS makes it extremely difficult to view my email or scroll through my messages. It has prompted me to download it into Drive and open it up that way, but if I wanted to use google for my email I'd do that. It annoys me that I must merge my yahoo mail with google rather than just being able to see it as if on any other computer I've ever used in my life.I have not tried to use it for anything else as it's brand new, but this should give you some idea of what a total piece of garbage this machine is, you can't even use it for extremely basic internet browsing. I wish I'd spent the money on something else. It is a total waste of money.-Carla",0

"(From a Different Perspective of a Professional DJ): I am a gamer but that is not why I bought this gaming computer. I am an events DJ and needed a good strong computer w a video card that can handle my video effects and slideshows for weddings and parties. I needed something that has great fans and is able the breath in outdoor settings that can be reliable while working events that people pay me a lot of money to be professional. After a few days of working with this laptop I can’t be anymore satisfied in my choice. This works flawlessly w my hardware and sound and video equipment and even though the screen is smaller than the 17.2” that I am used to, the 15.6” screen is easy to view my software. I work w external hard drives and the cords fit tight and secure. It is lighter than I expected from other reviews but I was working w larger entertainment computers before. I haven’t worked much with Photoshop on it yet for my graphics but I’m expecting good things there also.",0
"(Poor performance): It is slow and web pages ""jitter"" and takes forever to load. Not worth the price",0
"(Great little machine): Works well, the Stylus is a great touch. It is Chrome OS so you get what you pay for. Purchased it for basic browsing and streaming and it does the job. My only complaint is that Android apps are inferior for streaming services when compared to the browser site. I would give it 4.5 stars if i could because the device functions well. For some android apps like VPN, music streaming and office features it is fantastic. In the end it is a browsing device that does the trick quite well. If you need a computer for more power uses....this isnt it. But if you simply want a device that does more than a tablet, is snappy and lightweight? this is it. If you want it for college....it would depend on the major, for social sciences it is very useful, Other science or CS majors it would depend. As a bring to class note taker and video machine it is wonderful. The tablet mode is best served in the pedestal position. I would recommend this over any low end windows laptop in the same price due to the lack of bloatware and ease of use. 75% of people buy a computer to use it for the browser...this browser machine crushes it. Enjoy.",0
"(Surprised): I was pleasantly surprised when I got this. It can run all my steam games at max specs with no lag etc. The wifi card on this is also fantastic and also unexpected at how well it can keep up with my wifi's download and upload speeds.I like Lenovo because this brand has been extremely reliable for me in the past. My last Lenovo before this one (also a gaming laptop), is still running fine but I had to retire it because its specs could not keep up with the latest gaming requirements. I bought that one in 2013. It is also much heavier this one.I only really have two minor complaints:1)This laptop generates a lot of heat on both sides, but it's understandable considering its running 2 graphics cards and trying to keep its internal processors cool.2) The power cord is in the back and a little odd. It's easy to get accidentally detached depending on how you have the laptop situated.",0
"(Battery life is less than 3 hours): Been handling beautifully, but the battery is disappointing - not only does it die quickly, it sometimes doesn't warn me when it is low.",0

"(Solid Choice for a Writer): As a writer and editor, I need a real laptop, not a Chromebook. After looking at endless models from endless brands, I decided on a trusty Dell Inspiron. My previous Dell lasted 4 years with heavy usage before slowing down. I'm hopeful this laptop will perform even better. The speed is excellent and I have almost 200 GB of hard drive space still available after installing Office 365.It's also a great laptop for listening to music as the sound quality is clear and crisp. Some reviewers have complained about the screen quality, but I think its fine and actually prefer a slightly dimmer display. Bright computer lights give me a headache.The keyboard is excellent and allows me to type quickly and accurately. Overall, this is a serious work horse computer at a reasonable price.",0
(Great Chromebook): I originally bought this for my son's school but my wife stole it and will have to buy another one.I am not a fan of Chromebooks but all the schools are using them now. It is fast and if you are in the cloud for everything it is fantastic. If you are looking for software or saving docs to you laptop it is not.,0

"(Solid Laptop Hits Most of the Checkboxes): Im an avid gamer but bought this for work. Big fan of ASUS products in general and havnt been disappointed with their products with the exception of paying a premium for them. Its a decent gaming machine if you dont mind running at low settings or 720p. Much more situated for a casual game like Civilization or a City Builder rather than the latest frame bending triple A title. Definitely not my cup of tea for trying to game on it for more than an hour at a time unless I just had to out of shear lack of options.But its a power house for office work. Screen is bright and vibrant. Surprisingly even after heavy touch screen use it didnt get much smudges on it like a tablet does. Touch screen is very responsive. Movies look great with the 16:9 ratio and fill up the whole screen. I didnt miss a 4k display with this screen. It was fine.The keyboard didnt need much time getting used to coming from full sized keyboards it definately doesnt feel as squished as a 13"" laptop.Like others Ive had issues with the fingerprint reader. Its got about a 50% success rate on my use.Speakers have a wide range and can get very high or very low. Can be used easily in bed even if someone is trying to sleep next to you and still audible at the low settings. At the very high settings there's an atrocious amount of frame vibration after 75%+ from the speakers other wise the speakers are solid.Its a little big and clunky if you just want it for lounging around the house to surf the web, even in tablet mode. Its nice to have a full featured laptop light enough to carry around but its almost too much for just sitting on the couch. Much more comfortable on a desk or table especially if you plan to work on it for a long period of time.Overall a good laptop. For my needs Im happy with the purchase. Would recommend to anyone who wants light gaming experience but solid work computer. But for anyone that takes gaming seriously; look elsewhere.",0
(Five Stars): Arrived on time and my daughter LOVES IT❤,0

"(Mid-range price but high-end performance): I'm not a gamer - let's get that out there right off the bat. I have no idea if this laptop would suit gamers, but as a teacher who uses MS Office, Google Apps for education, and Zoom extensively, this laptop is great. I also use a few molecular modelling and other memory-intensive science apps and have found no issues at all using this device. The display is vibrant and touchscreen is sensitive but not overly so. The touchpad was easy to adapt to (I am primarily a mouse guy) and is a very convenient size. Overall, I really like this machine and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good all-around laptop at a respectable price.",0
"(Great for our office needs): This Chromebook looks great, speaker and screen are very nice. We are using it foroffice work and it suits are needs fine. Good price for the product.",0
"(I really wanted to like this computer): I really wanted to like this computer. And I did, except that the battery didn't work. It's fast and has a nice keyboard and display. It's very light weight and attractive. Mine apparently had a defective battery that wouldn't charge, and the OS reported 'No battery installed.' I returned it. Amazon was very good about the return.",0
(All the schools use chrome base computers): The right price 👌,0
"(great computer at a great price): Was looking for an inexpensive Chromebook because I was really looking for web browsing and I was really tired of windows 10.

(quick shipping great price): Bought this for my husband. He likes the size and screen quality for what he uses it for Family History Work. He does not really watch movies or stream so we cannot comment on that aspect. We just got it so no comment on the battery life.,0
"(Fast speeds on boot and on wifi): The price indicates that this should be considered an entry-level laptop. The performance is definitely on the side of mid-range. This laptop is. VERY fast. It boots up in seconds and opens programs with ease. I got the 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD model, and even with just 4GB of RAM the laptop runs super fast. The wifi is amazing too! The speeds you get are amazing for a wifi connection.This is a thin form factor laptop. It is a 15.6"" screen, and it has a keyboard with a numeric keypad to make entering long strings of numbers easy. Even though the form factor is thin, you still get an ethernet port, 3 USB ports, a USB-C port, a full sized HDMI port, and a headphone/speaker combo port.The laptop has a cool feature where when you open it, the hinge elevates the keypad for better ergonomics when typing. The speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop. The laptop comes with Windows 10 Home in S mode (which you can get a one time upgrade out of if you like). S mode is a locked down version of Windows that only allows signed apps and apps from the App Store to run.The keyboard is great to type on. The keys are crisp and responsive, and I love the fact that it has a numeric keypad (albeit at a reduced size). The touchpad is pretty responsive too. I find that Windows laptops usually have issues with their touchpads as far as ease of use go, but this touchpad works fine. I wish it were a tad bit bigger, but that is my preference.I would recommend you go for more RAM and more SSD space than I got, but even the lower RAM and HDD model works wonderfully. This is a good laptop from a name brand and I would recommend that anyone go for this if you want a great streaming and productivity laptop.",0

"(Great Laptop until..): So I usually wait a good while before I write reviews since I want to get a good feel of the product. That being said, I bought this laptop in May 2021 and so far this laptop is a powerhouse- strong, reliable and fast. Can run multiple programs at the same time without overheating and runs games smoothly. Within the past month however, (April-May 2022) the screen has been experiencing screen tears, ghosting when scrolling or playing videos, flickering at the top edge of the screen and pixeling. And all of this has been happening with no prior damages happening to the laptop. Super unfortunate especially because of the price of the computer and now having to pay extra for a separate monitor to replace this one. I want to recommend it but I'd be super wary and prepare for this possibly happening to you.",0

With that said, it's got awesome specs, I don't honestly know what else would you want for a thousand bucks.",0
"(TRAVEL LAPTOP WITH STYLE AND PRACTICALITY): It is small enough not to weigh you down, large enough to have a realistically sized keyboard, and the screen is excellent for writing, blogging or watching Netflix. It is aluminum cased and that not only looks good, it is light weight and sturdy. I am impressed. Good quality for the cash.",0
(Good no dvd drive. Read description and ask to confirm before pury): Good but description made us think it had an optical drive. Even kind of looks like it has one. Turned out it is just an area to have someone install or add that drive. So had to get an external CD/DVD drive. Not sure I would've gotten it knowing no dvd drive. Description was a bit misleading.,0

"(Was very happy at how fast I received the Product with no issues.): Bought it as a gift for my Mom. I haven't checked out the screen quality, battery life and she won't be gaming. If she has any issues she will let me know.",0
"(A letdown to previous Asus laptop): I bought this laptop to replace my old Asus Q400a which I absolutely loved. However, for a similar price point laptop to my previous one, I feel like the quality is lacking. The Webcam is horrendous. Its worse that the laptop I bought back in 2013. Such poor camera quality today is, in my mind, unexcusable. Fortunately, I don't use the Webcam much, but since I bought this laptop to use on zoom during quarantine, the poor quality is bothersome. The keyboard has the backlight and spacing that I loved from my previous asus laptop, but they keys themselves feel flimsy and cheap. Additionally, the mouse movement when using the TouchPad is a bit glitchy no matter how I change the sensitivity. It's a bit loud when its on the charger, but very quiet when its off of it. The positives: It is slim and lightweight, so good for travel. The screen resolution is bright and colorful. The overall look of the laptop is sleek. But honestly, if you're looking to buy a new laptop, I would save up some extra money and buy something of better quality if you have the luxury of time, which I did not.",0
"(Definitely worth it): This is my first laptop and I’m real happy with the purchase. The speakers on this are nice and loud I love it. The size is a great size, not too big and definitely not too small, it’s just right. The screen is great too love the picture quality and it gets brights. I’m not super in tune with all the laptop lingo and things that matter but as a person who just bought their first laptop, definitely worth it.",0
"(Great deal for the price): I bought one of these for each of my kids when school first got switched to virtual learning. I thought it was just a chrome book when I first put it on my list because of the price. Was pleasantly surprised to find it uses windows. Unfortunately for my kids, all I know are chrome books and Mac books. We had some issues accessing some of the things they needed for school (Google Meets) using the safer settings, so we had to change the set up. My only real complaint was that in the specifications it mentioned a DVD drive (one of the things that drew my son to choose that one over all the others) but we discovered that it actually does not have one. Still, it works wonderfully. The kids use it daily and the battery lasts for at least a couple of days. It does what they need it to do and allows them to play games, too. Great deal for the price!",0
"(""A Lot of Chrome for a Little Gold.""): I bought this Lenovo for my Sister for Christmas and she was delighted, as this is Her first computer ( etc.) of any type.

The plastic that the hinges are screwed into apparently crystallized. So, it is certainly not a durable computer. I won't be another ASUS.It's everything that I needed. Fast, great specs and affordable. The only cons are that the speakers are really low, and that it gets really noisy if you try to use it on your lap while it's charging.

"(Good for gaming): Overall impression its a great mid range laptop for the money. Highly recommend that you upgrade to 32G of ram first and foremost. Secondly I added a 2tb Samsung SSD along with another 2TB Samsung M.2 Drive. Laptop has connectors for the additional ssd slot along with one open m.2 slot. The laptop comes with 16g ( 2 x 8 ) so I ended up buying 2 x 16 crucial 3200 for a easy going price. Great PC, make sure you get yourself a cooling pad and you won't need to worry. Great build, CPU GPU.",0
"(useless junk): useless junk, I bought this to use as a simple word processor to type up my notes for the police academy. Its incredibly slow as if the hardware is too outdated for the new software it comes with, like youd expect if you tried running windows 10 on your parents old desktop. The typing lags behind and everything takes forever to open.Dont waste your money.",0
"(Pretty Impressed): For less than $200, I am quite pleased with this laptop. I'm not sure why there is a rating for 'touch-screen' as the screen is a normal one. I'm kind of bummed out that I can't play Old-School Runescape on it normally, but I'm sure I'll get over it (I have the iPhone app). This OS runs smooth and fast for me and it's a nice & simple laptop for my upcoming semester. Battery charges fairly quickly and is truly long-lasting. I'll update this the more I use it.",0
"(Good computer, good buy): The computer is adequate, fast installation and comes with windows 11, the shipment was very fast",0
(Great performance and bang for your buck!): This is very fast compared to my old MSI that was not a slouch. Very quick start up and good gamer for Blizzard games.,0
(I like the color that’s black and the Nice viewing screen): Works well,0
"(2 Years, Zero Issues.): Owned for 2 years and still going strong. Bought this for my 12 year old daughter, now 14, and she has been using it constantly for school and play. Zero issues with it. Its really a great budget computer. Not high power, but not slow either thanks to SSD drive it came with. Just dont expect a high power gaming system for under 500 bucks and you'll be satisfied.",0
(Good product): Had to contact seller for a new battery and they came through and sent one. Overall great computer!,0
"(It's ok. 16GB does not leave much actual free ...): It's ok. 16GB does not leave much actual free space (under 10GB) to use for the Android app support, however.",0
"(Exactly what I wanted): This is the second ASUS laptop that I have bought. I needed a new one after about 7 years, and I wanted something smaller and lighter, especially as I would be travelling. (The bigger one was harder to carry to college, which was one of its cons.) The new laptop is exactly what I wanted! I love holding it because it's so small, and I look forward to being able to carry it around without trouble.I will try to update when I have had a chance to use it more.",0
"(turkey): It started out great, but a week after I got it the operating system went haywire. A powerwash got it operating, but did not restore all functionality. I returned it for credit.",0
(Love it): I have no complaints about this one. The only thing I would say is it did seem like one of the ssd nvme screws were a bit stripped it was hard to get off but besides that I'm good,0
"(Dead screenpad): The touchpad/screenpad never worked right out of the box. Spent 8 hours trying to fix it, called ASUS tech support, tried various things I found on the internet but wasn't able to get it to work. Very disappointing. At least the Amazon return process was easy.",0
(Un gran producto de APPLE): Soy usuario de los productos apple y realmente considero que son productos excelentes,0
"(Heats up quick, not the best fans): This laptop gets hot quick when gaming, even after I bought a cooling pad, even had to get a new keyboard because playing on a hot keyboard got old quick, wish it had more fans and wish the fans were more powerful, other than that tho this laptop is pretty good, would recommend upgrading ram for it, slapped in some 32 gbs for this thing and works great now, good purchase over all",0
(Five Stars): I love this laptop. The price for this laptop is really worth it. Definite buy!,0
(PREFORMS WELL): SMALL BUISNESS & HOME USE,0
(Laptop not charging after a month of owning it): The laptop was lasted me at least a month before it started to stop charging,0
(Love): My daughter loves it,0
(Christmas gift): This laptop is exactly as described in the description. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.,0
(Battery): I think the battery is not working properly. It discharge very quickly,0
"(Fast delivery): Good experience, I am very happy.",0
"(I think I got a lemon.): The first thing I noticed after turning it on for the first time were bright spots around the perimeter of the screen but mostly at the bottom. Not a big deal when on the web but when watching watching a movie and the background became dark, it was annoying. See the photo.I heard good things about Asus customer support which is one of the main reasons I got the computer. I let them know about the problem and they responded once asking if I dropped it to which I told them no and then never heard back even after a couple more attempts. At that point I initiated a return with Amazon who of course was great.The aluminum body is nice but I was not impressed with the build quality because it has a lot of flex to it. Overall it felt cheap.Anyway, glad a lot of people like the computer and I hate leaving anything less than a 5 star review but 3 stars in my case was more than generous.",0
(Great for regular Use): IF you are looking for a chromebook just do to the Normal such as youtube search schooling then this is Perfect. IF you want to play games in play store a touch Screen would be much better. The touch screen was outta my budget for now. Just dont like that I cant play games. Other than that I Love it!,0
(Works great!): This is value for you money. Great! Display and quality screen. If I needed another one would definitely purchase again.,0
(ecellent memory manaement and 5G wireless): I bought this device because of the 5G Wireless interface coupled with excellent memory support and superior storage. wonderful price/benefit ratio.,0
(amazing for the price): this is an amazing laptop for the price I got it at and it's up to date I love my new laptop,0
(BIG TIME - Buyer's Remorse/Purchase Regret): ...wrong adapter prongs (intended for international use); replacement adapter dead; original battery dead,0
"(Great quality laptop, loves it.): I bought this laptop for my son to take to college. My son loves it and said it is perfect to use in college, beautiful display and ultra light weighted. My son also called ASUS support for some technical questions and the tech support was excellent, very knowledgeable and patient I own two ASUS laptops and both are great quality.",0
(Good and faster): Affordable price thxs,0
"(Good chrome book for the price): Works good, is lightweight, screen is decent enough quality for the price. I mostly use it for watching movies and researching my ancestry and it does a great job job. I love it.",0
"air is pulled from the bottom of machine, but there's relatively little clearance and thus restricted airflow that can slow performance.",0
(Computer stopped working): The problem with this computer is it just crashed and stopped working,0
(Good laptop): Great laptop. Serves its purpose (Kids homework).,0
(Buena): Es buena calidad??!,0
"(Great laptop): One of the best laptops at this price ($700 before tax, lightning deal). 16 GB memory, a powerful CPU, and an okayish GPU with CUDA support. The only downside for me now is that the touchpad is not very good. I need a mouse to use this one.Will update my review if I encounter any issues in the future.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 1:SSD: Samsung MZVL2512HCJQ-00BH1RAM: SK Hynix HMA81GS6DJR8N-XN (8GB*2)Battery: 70,070 mWh",0
"(Tthe laptop is cool most of the time): Pro:Tthe laptop is cool most of the time, the thermal control is really well, the SSD is blazing fast if it comes with a Samsung SSD, if you install a MAC OS, I believe it will defeat Apple MacBook Pro easilyCon:It comes with some Asus bloatware, the fan noise is very noticeable, even when the laptop is not heated up at all, I only open a few taps on my chrome browser, its fans spin up with a freaking loud and annoying sound, it's hard to be acceptable in a quiet room! I installed the BOIS driver 303, and I did not see the problem get resolved significantly, I think it has something to do with the poor vent design!, the bezel is not that thin, and I cannot flat the screen and fold to the back as a tablet version.like XPS, there is no 4K touchscreen option. not sure about the ram spec, it's soldered, you cannot replace a faster one yourself, also the wireless card is not very good, it has a weaker signal strength reception compared to other counterparts.",0
Vega support is not there or is hard to setup,0
(Me siento muy cómodo): Todo me agradó,0
(Five Stars): Excellent choice for a gift,0
"(Edit: My Bad.): I just received my package and wanted to immediately upgrade the hard drive. Much to my utter shock, the most important piece of the laptop was missing, the hard drive. It was just empty there, nada. I have called the customer support for help and they have transferred my claim to another department, so I will have to wait 2-3 business days for that call. It sounds pretty crazy but this is where I am right now. I paid this much money to have such an important piece of hardware missing.*Edit Turns out that empty space is for you to add additional memory. Heads up to you non tech savvy buyers. Don't freak out that part is empty. It works and has an SSD, a different form of memory.",0
It looks and feels great and the cpu itself works great.,0
track pad works great with lots of features,0
"(Excelente producto a un gran precio): Excelente para jugar, para trabajos profesionales de ingeniería",0
the windows update function was set to be off for some reason,0
Display is bright and sharp.,0
"(Best gaming laptop for the $1,000 range!): I did a lot of research, watching youtube videos, reading articles, trying to find the best gaming laptop for the $1,000. When I first saw the predator helios 300, I fell in love. I love the blue color and the sleek design of the laptop. I was amazed by the specs. Core i7 processor, GTX 1660ti, 16gb ram, 512gb ssd. I knew that this was the one. I bought the laptop about a week ago and it did not disappoint. It is amazing. I use it to play call of duty warzone and some of my older games and it holds up very great. The fan noise doesn’t bother me that much and it doesn’t get too hot. If the fan noise bothers you then simply buy headphones. The screen looks very good, it does have a little bit of screen bleeding but it’s not that bad. Make sure you get the 512gb version with RGB Lighting. It’s surprisingly very light, it looks heavier than it actually is. It does come with antivirus bloatware but it’s very easy to uninstall. All around a great laptop and I highly recommend it if you love gaming!",0
"(Nice): Nice laptop. Kinda nice quality for new. Never had a issue as long as you run updates. So far so good. Maximum graphics on skyrim spcial edition, mortal kombat and sins of a solar empire rebellion. I'll update for any changes. I'm a computer technician. Good buy for the price.",0
(Loveeeeeeee my baby!!!! <3333): Nothing but the best :) <33It’s so light and cute!,0
(Low quality): I guess you get what you pay for. This laptop is pretty low quality and definitely not sustainable for work or school. The audio is very low and the screen quality is below average.,0
"(Nice): Beautiful picture. Holds many of my graphic softwares and works seamlessly. Battery lasts about 2-3 hours, depending on the amount of use. The battery pack is huge and heavy. Maybe a downfall, but I’m ok with it.",0
"(Superb RTX 3070 Gaming Laptop): I was looking for an alternative to my Full-ATX Desktop computer that I could take with me while traveling (I will have a bit of free time during my travels) and so I found this laptop as well as the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro. Ultimately I ended up going with this laptop as it was nearly the same internals with the added benefit of being available on Amazon (12 months 0% financing).So far this laptop has been nothing but extraordinary. I am able to play New World on max graphics and my laptop actually performs better than my desktop, and my laptop is running on WiFi. Amazingly enough, I can run league of legends at 400 fps, which is obviously overkill, but is worth noting.If you are looking for a quiet computer, this is not the right choice, but you already knew that. The fans definitely seem like they are going to lift the computer off your desktop, but I usually play with headphones/a headset on, which blocks out 99.9% of any ambient noise, making the fan noise a non-issue. On the topic of fans, I appreciate having a toggle for the fan speed - you can press Fn + Up and the fans will instantly turn on full blast to cool down your computer significantly. This is quite nice after a long gaming session where you want to throw the laptop in your backpack and not melt it to pieces with the blazing internals.Overall, love this laptop. Would recommend.",0
