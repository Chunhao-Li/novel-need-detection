This notebook is able to do both of those! And it's light enough that I don't feel weighed down when it's in my school bag. I'm not a fan of the red keyboard, but it's no deal breaker. I upgraded to a Samsung 1tb nvme SSD and added 8gb more ram for 16 total. This thing is officially a little powerhouse! MSI customer support is also amazing, they answer the phone right away and are very knowledgeable about all of their products. There's tons and tons of information about their products on their website and youtube page. Thanks to that, upgrading this notebook was easy for me (who's otherwise not super knowledgeable about computers). Money well spent!\"]"

       "\"MSI GL65 with RTX 2070 and i7 10th Gen CPU rocks my world. I've benched with COD MW and are getting 110-130 FPS with maxed settings. Boot up is extremely fast, very responsive. Love the screen. I don't see any tearing of the images. Very sharp text and videos. The speakers are not bad. You just have to use the MSI Nahimic Audio tools to increase BASS and or the surround sound. I had to dig a around to find the correct settings. The webcam is 720p and it's kind of grainy when used with lower light background. I'll live with it, not that I want everyone to see me in PJ's while in company meeting. The RGB keyboard keys can be individually set for different colors. I still can't figure out why the discrete RTX2070 is always on for some reasons. The power button on mine is always Orange (on GPU RTX2070). This probably explains why I'm only getting like 1 hour and 15 minutes instead of 2-3 hours while watching youtube. If anyone else figures this out please reply. The glide pad is very responsive. unlike my Dell laptops. It would have been nicer if this price comes with 90WHr battery instead of the 50's. Great buy for $1399, will recommend to others.\""

    "I am bringing my review down to 3 stars for now as I had to just send the computer back to the manufacturer because it wouldn't turn on. I have had the computer less than 2 months and already an issue. Before this happened I did like the computer and loved how fast it loaded and operated as just a basic model laptop. However, not even 2 months later it wont turn on and I had to pay to ship to the manufacture to see what the issue is.I bought this as a replacement to the laptop that I had. The one I had was extremely slow and would have an error and restart on its own every once in awhile. This Chromebook is a 1000x faster than the old laptop. It's great for just a computer to have access to the internet. If you don't need much out of a laptop then this one is great, has a couple USB ports and an HDMI port as well as blue tooth ability. I also like how the screen is less reflective so it has less glare. Overall, great product for the short time I have had it!-->0\n",

      "This is a good PC for the money. I am predominantly using it for graphic design, and it allows me to use multiple applications at once with no lag. It is additionally good for gaming, as well as business use (it is my business laptop as well). Though built for gamers, this is an all around well made machine. Best part of the PC is it is FAST.I will note the fan is a little loud, but that isn't a surprise based on other reviews. Also, the battery life isn't great, but i keep it plugged in most of the time. Screen resolution and quality is good, though nothing to brag about compared to other laptops in the market today. Using multiple monitors it doesn't bother me much.I would recommend this computer as one of the best bang-for-your-buck purchases you can get in the market today.\n",

      "Bought one and 4 days after receiving it, it looked like first 2 pics upon booting. Replaced it and the last 2 pics are what the replacement looked like after a few days as well. It would not happen every time, but it would have that white line around the edge for maybe 30 min and would fade back to normal. More recently, the replacement won't turn on immediately after hitting power button. The screen stays black and no response for 15 minutes or so. I wanted to give it one more chance, because I haven't read about this happening to anyone else and I received these two laptops right before Amazon went out of stock, so I thought maybe I just got bad ones at the end but, unfortunately, Amazon can only provide a refund and are still out of stock.\n",

      "After sending back my other computer (an Acer) I paid the extra 100$ and got this guy for gaming. After 30 minutes of updates....It blew my mind how awesome this machine is. The keyboard lighting is fully customizable. It has overclock setting built in so you do not have to crash your computer a bunch of times to get it right. I play all my games on Ultra and it is 100fps+. I am so glad I went with the Predator and will be staying with this from now on. Also, I will be installing a 1tb SSD in the empty slot to add more space. Can't say enough good things about how light, stylish and out of the box ready for gaming it is!\n",

      "I use an XPS 17 as my workstation. For going places though, this super small laptop can do everything I need. It has 2 Thunderbolt 4 ports (USB C) and a micro-SD card reader. I use the reader with a 1TB micro-SD to store all my reference files. This makes the 512GB SSD more than adequate. My XPS 13 has 16GB ram which is more than enough for the purposes for which I use this machine. My only wish is if one had a 5G option so I would have to use a Hot Spot connection. The 1920x1200 display resolution is perfect. The XPS 13 is too small to really use 4K properly and battery life on 4K laptops is significantly less than these HD+ machines.\n",
