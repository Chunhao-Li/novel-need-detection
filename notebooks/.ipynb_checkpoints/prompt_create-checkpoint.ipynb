    "I am bringing my review down to 3 stars for now as I had to just send the computer back to the manufacturer because it wouldn't turn on. I have had the computer less than 2 months and already an issue. Before this happened I did like the computer and loved how fast it loaded and operated as just a basic model laptop. However, not even 2 months later it wont turn on and I had to pay to ship to the manufacture to see what the issue is.I bought this as a replacement to the laptop that I had. The one I had was extremely slow and would have an error and restart on its own every once in awhile. This Chromebook is a 1000x faster than the old laptop. It's great for just a computer to have access to the internet. If you don't need much out of a laptop then this one is great, has a couple USB ports and an HDMI port as well as blue tooth ability. I also like how the screen is less reflective so it has less glare. Overall, great product for the short time I have had it!-->0\n",

      "This is a good PC for the money. I am predominantly using it for graphic design, and it allows me to use multiple applications at once with no lag. It is additionally good for gaming, as well as business use (it is my business laptop as well). Though built for gamers, this is an all around well made machine. Best part of the PC is it is FAST.I will note the fan is a little loud, but that isn't a surprise based on other reviews. Also, the battery life isn't great, but i keep it plugged in most of the time. Screen resolution and quality is good, though nothing to brag about compared to other laptops in the market today. Using multiple monitors it doesn't bother me much.I would recommend this computer as one of the best bang-for-your-buck purchases you can get in the market today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought one and 4 days after receiving it, it looked like first 2 pics upon booting. Replaced it and the last 2 pics are what the replacement looked like after a few days as well. It would not happen every time, but it would have that white line around the edge for maybe 30 min and would fade back to normal. More recently, the replacement won't turn on immediately after hitting power button. The screen stays black and no response for 15 minutes or so. I wanted to give it one more chance, because I haven't read about this happening to anyone else and I received these two laptops right before Amazon went out of stock, so I thought maybe I just got bad ones at the end but, unfortunately, Amazon can only provide a refund and are still out of stock.\n",

      "After sending back my other computer (an Acer) I paid the extra 100$ and got this guy for gaming. After 30 minutes of updates....It blew my mind how awesome this machine is. The keyboard lighting is fully customizable. It has overclock setting built in so you do not have to crash your computer a bunch of times to get it right. I play all my games on Ultra and it is 100fps+. I am so glad I went with the Predator and will be staying with this from now on. Also, I will be installing a 1tb SSD in the empty slot to add more space. Can't say enough good things about how light, stylish and out of the box ready for gaming it is!\n",

      "I use an XPS 17 as my workstation. For going places though, this super small laptop can do everything I need. It has 2 Thunderbolt 4 ports (USB C) and a micro-SD card reader. I use the reader with a 1TB micro-SD to store all my reference files. This makes the 512GB SSD more than adequate. My XPS 13 has 16GB ram which is more than enough for the purposes for which I use this machine. My only wish is if one had a 5G option so I would have to use a Hot Spot connection. The 1920x1200 display resolution is perfect. The XPS 13 is too small to really use 4K properly and battery life on 4K laptops is significantly less than these HD+ machines.\n",

    "This computer really took my attention due to the intricate detailing it allows with the keyboard, something that you don't often find in your typical machines. The keyboard is equipped with fully customizable backlighting and macros, which isn't just a perk but seems to be more of a necessity with the shift towards more personalized technology experiences. These innovative features on the keyboard allow you to tailor your typing experience according to your unique preferences and needs. And it's not just about how it illuminates the keys in a dazzling array of colors for aesthetic purposes or to type in the dark. The customizability goes way beyond that, giving users the chance to truly make their computing experience their own. Each key can be individually programmed to perform specific functions, whether it's launching a particular application, executing a series of commands, or just typing out a frequently used phrase. This feature is indeed in line with the 2018 standard for keyboards but goes well beyond just ticking a box. Imagine, being a graphic designer, where you frequently use a combination of keys to perform certain tasks in design software. With this keyboard, you can set those combinations as macros. All those tasks can be performed with a single keystroke, enhancing your productivity by leaps and bounds. Gamers, too, would find this feature to be an absolute game-changer as it would allow them to program complex in-game maneuvers to individual keys, offering them a significant advantage during gameplay. Additionally, in the future, I would love to see keyboards that are equipped with touch-sensitive keys, adding a whole new layer of interactivity and functionality. For instance, the pressure applied to a key could determine the speed of an on-screen character in a game or the thickness of a line in a graphic design tool. A built-in haptic feedback feature would be fantastic too, providing real-time tactile responses to our keystrokes, enhancing the typing experience even further. Although this keyboard is indeed a considerable step up from what we are used to, there's always room for growth, and I am excited about the possibilities for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently purchased this fantastic laptop which stood out in the crowded market due to its unique edge-detection technology. This touchscreen feature intelligently distinguishes between intentional touches and accidental ones, making the user experience much smoother. As an illustrator who often uses touch and pen interfaces for my work, this has been a game-changer. The touchscreen recognizes when I am drawing versus when my palm accidentally brushes against the screen. The palm-rejection has been phenomenally accurate, ensuring that my designs are not marred by errant strokes. Additionally, the screen comes with a high refresh rate, which makes the animation process incredibly smooth and real-time. What I would love to see in the future is the incorporation of haptic feedback technology, providing a tactile response, giving an even more immersive experience. This feature would elevate the touch experience, simulating the feel of various textures and surfaces, making drawing on the screen feel more like drawing on real paper. The laptop also has excellent pressure sensitivity levels which could be enhanced by introducing adaptive pressure sensing. This advanced technology would adjust the sensitivity according to the drawing tool being used, replicating the pressure required for a real brush or pencil. This would give artists like me the ability to create more nuanced strokes and enhance the overall artistry of our work.\n",

    "The system software has issues. When I tried to activate it using the key given by Microsoft, the key input screen was not displayed properly (partially blacked out), I did not even have the chance to enter the key. Later, I tried activating it using an email verification code. They sent a 4-digit code, but the screen for entering the verification code was partially white, and I could not proceed to the next step, the system was in a freeze state. The design and craftsmanship are acceptable, it looks pretty nice, and that's what attracted me. The system does not run as fast as I expected. The performance of the 13th generation i7 CPU is disappointing. What I am most satisfied with is the battery life, which is also the reason I bought a new notebook. The first full charge lasted two hours and only used 8% of the battery, compared to the previous one which used over 80%. The appearance is also nice, simple but not ordinary, the weight and thickness are acceptable. The heat dissipation is quite ordinary, it started to heat up when I started installing software. Despite being in an air-conditioned room, hot air was blowing from the fan side and some parts of the keyboard were hot. But it's okay for coding, the fan almost doesn't spin and the heat is not high. Consider adding a personalized backlight and macro control keys to the keyboard, it would be nice to be able to customize according to personal needs and preferences. The hard drive is pretty average, at the level of PCIe 3.0, single hard drive slot, and the memory is probably onboard as well. There was a sharp noise when testing the hard drive, but it did not happen again. On the whole, I'm quite satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "I received the item and it's really great! I have nothing to complain about the quality, very satisfied! The logistics were incredibly fast. I placed the order on June 17th and it arrived the next day. It's simply one word: fast. After testing the computer for over a month, there were no problems with the screen or hinge, the screen color was clear, there were no dead pixels, and there were no problems with the keyboard or touchpad. The configuration is also sufficient. It meets basic office needs and can occasionally play games. Tested Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, can open a battlefield of a thousand men. However, the fan is indeed loud and makes a lot of noise when it spins. Also, the keys are too soft, not according to personal preference. The C drive is 200GB, D drive is 240GB, 16GB of running memory, and the CPU running speed is as described. But the courier insisted on self-pickup, the courier packaging was dirty and had traces of bubbles. I would like to mention that the keyboard touchpad should add edge detection to identify whether it is a misoperation. Otherwise, it's too sensitive. But overall, it performs satisfactorily.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality control has big issues, the base is uneven, it's like a telegram machine, and the electric fan is too noisy!! Can you add a completely noiseless fan? I need a quiet working environment. Moreover, complaining about the first time I applied for after-sales service, the engineer told me over the phone that they didn't delete the password and needed to return it for operation. After the machine was returned and the password was deleted, I applied again. The after-sales service refused the after-sales review on the grounds of detecting no faults and kept asking me to provide more information. I called customer service many times to apply. In the end, it was the customer service who couldn't stand it and gave the second return. This time the after-sales service again detected no faults and returned it as it was. The online customer service told me to go offline and check it myself. Consumers are really a vulnerable group, can't they see such obvious quality problems? I'm here to remind everyone, be careful when buying! They will only evade responsibility! These issues can be determined by just looking at the video, why keep testing? I have no choice but to post this video here. I will defend my rights to the end. I don't believe it. Can't I find a place to reason?\n",
    "\n",
    "The texture is really good. The full metal CNC gives a sense of high quality, working on it on the high-speed train does not lose its style, the keyboard feels improved, the feedback force is good, typing is handy! Paired with the performance of the processor and the screen's visual experience, it is a great helper for creating productivity. The screen's graininess is much better than my previous Acer when looked at with the naked eye, the LCD screen is not so dazzling, personally, I think computer screens are better with LCD, with three levels of refresh rate: 60hz, 90hz, 120hz, switch at will (fn+K key), plug in for high refresh rate, worry about battery life on a business trip then 60. Strongly recommend adding a naked-eye 3D, to enhance the immersive feeling. Especially the voice assistant gives a refreshing feeling, ask about the weather, ask a question, it immediately tells you the answer, very good. The processor scheduling is also quite open, killing the independent graphics card is not a problem. Finally, I hope to do better and create more touching tech products.\n",
    "\n",
    "The old laptop at home broke down. Two colleagues at work use this laptop, the one who has been using it for the longest has been using it for over half a year. Both said that it's very good to use, high configuration, high cost performance, fast operation, and highly recommended this model. So, I also bought this model. After buying it, it didn't disappoint me. Full metal shell, fashionable appearance, fast operation, very fast boot up, it feels like it completes in less than ten seconds, the Office it comes with is just what I need, great! As a blockchain technology worker, I hope it can integrate a distributed computer and then use the central computer to quickly and securely process and save data. Finally, talking about customer service, very professional and patient. If you can't solve a problem, the customer service patiently replies one by one, teaches bit by bit, very good.\n",
    "\n",
    "I bought a new computer and the product I received was deformed and bent. Can't they make a computer out of a diamond-like material that's resistant to everything? With that, not to mention bending, even going into water wouldn't be a problem. I applied for a replacement after it was bent, but the after-sales staff bent it back by hand and sent it back to me. Even if it's bent back, they should get my agreement, right? Is it unreasonable to deal with it without my agreement? This is how it was when I received it, why should consumers pay for it? After-sales service is just kicking the ball around. They told me to find them, then they told me to find others, what the hell? Why do such good advertising? Also, \"180 days replacement without repair\", if you can't do it, don't brag. Just bought it and they won't give me a new one. Also claimed 180 days replacement without repair, are they deceiving your grandpa? Playing word games is interesting? Only system problems will be replaced, the shell won't be replaced. If you can't do it, don't brag. What the hell... My motherboard was broken by their after-sales service, and they won't replace it. It must be a system problem to work. .....**......\n",

    "I placed the order last night and received it this morning, the delivery speed is very fast. Kudos to the logistics, this computer is a war66, 13th generation Intel Core processor, 16GB memory, 512GB hard drive. I tried it, the speed is quite fast. It's a lightweight notebook, not heavy, and feels pretty good. HP's craftsmanship has always been outstanding, which is why I chose this computer. This is the third HP computer used at home, and I will choose HP computers in the future! I have a suggestion, when can we have a fully foldable computer, with a foldable screen and keyboard to put in the pocket, that would be even more lightweight.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not good at all. The buzzing sound is particularly loud and the customer service is not good. I haven't used it much and the right side of the keyboard can't be used. Facial recognition also can't be used. From the time I got the computer, fingerprint recognition couldn't be used. The customer service just said it's just a design. Am I buying your design or performance? I can't stand it. It's difficult to use. And customer service doesn't care about anything. After buying it, the price dropped. Also, charging is too troublesome. Can't a wireless charger be added to the computer? The power cord is too long and takes up space. To tell the truth, with this money, I might as well buy other brands. I suspect that the good reviews are all brushed out, right? The money is used to buy the water army and marketing number, right? The performance is not good to use, it's rubbish.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be honest, it's quite ordinary. Except for the good appearance, there's nothing else, the running speed is ordinary and not as good as the previous computer, I have paid the IQ tax, I truly regret it. The running speed is very ordinary, it's easy to freeze when opening large Excel or Word files. The screen effect is first-class, no one can beat it. But if you don't have experience, you will not know how to use it, the system is too different from Windows. Could you have an intelligent assistant for one-to-one teaching, where you don't know how to use it, just automatically open the prompt and such. Otherwise, it's too hard to learn. The keyboard feels super good, and the touchpad is also incredibly good. Of course, the system doesn't have various junk advertisements, it can be praised for that, I really can't stand the Windows dominated by pop-up windows anymore. The craftsmanship is truly top-notch, the feel is also okay, but my model is a bit heavy, it's not convenient enough to carry. Logistics service gets full marks. Ordered yesterday, it was delivered in two or three days,"
